0,Qbee00,"August 14, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Laptop!,"I got this laptop to replace my MacBook air and so far, it's great. It's a good size (12x9in- similar to the Mac which is 13x9in), lightweight, gorgeous color, and the screen is so crisp and clear. I've only had it for a day so hopefully it works out and doesn't need repairs since it's refurbished. It looked brand spanking new when I opened the box and has no scratches or anything anywhere, I looked very carefully. I noticed the laptop got pretty warm for a little bit but I knew that from other reviews so I'll probably just buy a laptop stand to put under. The speakers are nice and loud, the track pad is smooth and easy to use, and it sets you up with the ability to connect to your android phone. I set up my Samsung A32 and works like a charm.I'm very happy with it so far so hopefully I don't get any surprises on it not working. But I will update if that happens.","Microsoft Surface Laptop 3, 10th Gen Intel Core i5 (13.5-inch Touchscreen - 8GB Memory - 256GB SSD) - Sandstone (Renewed Premium)",$499.00
1,Gab,"August 16, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great computer for the price. Worth the risk,"❤️❤️❤️❤️This is a great computer for the price. I bought it on sale for $499 a month ago. I have had no major issues so far, except Netflix sometimes glitches. But that could also be my Wi-Fi’s problem. The touchscreen is amazing. Would recommend getting some kind of sticker or case to put on the bottom and top of computer to help with scratches. Over all it’s worth the money. It’s a great starter computer for college and I have encouraged friends to get this computer. I love it. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️","Microsoft Surface Laptop 3, 10th Gen Intel Core i5 (13.5-inch Touchscreen - 8GB Memory - 256GB SSD) - Sandstone (Renewed Premium)",$499.00
2,Scott Myhre,"August 9, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Second time was a charm......,"I ordered this during the summer sale for $499, but the first one crashed and burned in 2 days. I thought, oh no, what did I just buy into. Well, without any argument they immediately sent me a new one and it has been working perfectly. I am real happy now, with the way things went. I have no idea of what caused the problem with the first one but I'm sure happy with the second one. At half price, you couldn't go wrong and I would recommend this computer to all.","Microsoft Surface Laptop 3, 10th Gen Intel Core i5 (13.5-inch Touchscreen - 8GB Memory - 256GB SSD) - Sandstone (Renewed Premium)",$499.00

4,Juan M. Cabrera Ramirez,"July 9, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Refurbished Laptop is Like New,I received the Refurbished Surface Laptop in Sandstone 256GB/8GB/i5 configuration.  It was in excellent packaging and in excellent condition!  It seemed like I was opening a brand new product.  Item was securely packed and well protected.  I definitely recommend this purchase; especially at the $500 price I bought it for!  =)The screen was very reflective though.  I recommend buying a non-reflective/matte screen cover.,"Microsoft Surface Laptop 3, 10th Gen Intel Core i5 (13.5-inch Touchscreen - 8GB Memory - 256GB SSD) - Sandstone (Renewed Premium)",$499.00

10,Donna Bloberger,"August 5, 2022",2.0 out of 5 stars,Defective.,"Computer looked new and was in great physical shape. Battery overheats, camera does not consistently work, could not get through setup because it kept requiring update and restart. Performed up date/restart at least 6 times, still would not work. Contacted Microsoft Support, no help. Requested a replacement from Amazon, but was only given the option to return.","Microsoft Surface Laptop 3, 10th Gen Intel Core i5 (13.5-inch Touchscreen - 8GB Memory - 256GB SSD) - Sandstone (Renewed Premium)",$499.00
11,Rob,"July 25, 2022",1.0 out of 5 stars,Obviously not tested during the refurbish,"This laptop was sold as ""certified refurbished"". It even says so on the fancy Microsoft box it comes in. While the laptop looked new, it is quite obvious that is is not refurbished. The laptop blue screened constantly. Every 30 to 60 seconds. It couldn't even make it thought the setup process. It's likely an issue with bad RAM. However, it wouldn't stay booted long enough to do any tests to verify. This should have been very apparent during the refurbish process and if any quality control was done at all before it left whatever facility repackaged it, it would have been easily caught. While presentation for a refurbished product was excellent, it's very sad it was shipped out again with likely the same flaw it was originally returned for.","Microsoft Surface Laptop 3, 10th Gen Intel Core i5 (13.5-inch Touchscreen - 8GB Memory - 256GB SSD) - Sandstone (Renewed Premium)",$499.00
