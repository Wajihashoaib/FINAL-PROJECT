0,Edwin C,"July 11, 2020",5.0 out of 5 stars,The complete package Windows Ultrabook. This should be the de facto Macbook alternative!,"If you don't want a MacBook Air/Pro because of macOS, or other Windows manufacturers such as Dell/HP/Lenovo have let you down in the past, the Surface Laptop 3 (i7 1065G7, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD, Matte Black) is quite the option. In my opinion it's the best premium Ultrabook on the market, especially impressive as Microsoft has only been at it for about 3 years.As performance between 85% of Ultrabooks is relatively similar, build and design is a big deciding factor to me, and the Surface won out against worthy competitors such as the Dell XPS 13 (9300), HP Spectre x360 13, and Razer Blade Stealth. A lot of Microsoft + Intel intangibles like Instant On, smart backlighting, and adaptive brightness help this feel like a polished machine that's been innovated for over 10+ years like the XPS lineup.The display on the Surface is excellent. The resolution is higher than standard full HD (not quite QHD because of the 3:2 aspect ratio), and doesn't sacrifice on either battery life (4K Ultrabooks make no sense) or picture quality. Apple and Microsoft seem to be the only ones who believe in making QHD+ displays for 13-14"" instead of 4K. It just makes more sense for everyone.Performance is great for a 15W laptop, although I don't need much horsepower from my laptop as I have other desktops for heavy workloads. It's good in short bursts, and at lasting long. The quad core i7-1065G7 has the highest level graphics config for Intel's Ice Lake processors, so this is as good as it gets for this generation. I would recommend 95% of buyers to just buy the 8GB RAM models, as you'll find more use in just having 4 cores than 16GB RAM.Battery life is good, not amazing. I get about 6-7 hours of active use out of a full charge. It can top up pretty fast while in sleep mode with the included Surface Connect charger. Coming from a device that gave me 2 hours max off of battery, I'm not asking for much. There is some endurance left to be desired, but it's enough for what I need.The touchpad and keyboard are amazing. They're both among the best that Windows Ultrabooks have to offer (although that's not saying much..)Some minor gripes/annoyances:-Intel's Bluetooth and Wi-Fi drivers seem to mess with reception on this device. My range with my Bluetooth headphones is unexpectedly shorter than usual. When waking the device from sleep, Wi-Fi takes a long time to reconnect properly; I sometimes have to restart the machine to get online.- I knew that ordering a matte black metal device would be a challenge to keep clean, but yeah.. pretty hurts doesn't it?Overall, I think this should be the default recommendation for a Windows Ultrabook. at $1299 for the i5, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD, value isn't the best but you have what is the best looking Ultrabook on the market other than the new XPS 13.","Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 – 13.5"" Touch-Screen – Intel Core i7 – 16GB Memory - 256GB Solid State Drive – Sandstone","$1,149.00"
1,Earnest Borg 9,"January 19, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Powerful computer in a small, lightweight package. (Music Production/Graphics Processing)","I purchased this machine because I recently purchased several Native Instruments plugins for use with my application copy of Fruity Loops. My old computer was struggling to even eek out a full measure without crackling or stuttering, so it was time.This computer is simultaneously running FLStudio with multiple heavy Native Instrument channels without any stutter. I will say that it initially did have a little lag, but upping the buffer threshold has taken care of it. I have seen some complain that the I7 processor is insufficient for heavy music production, but if you are concerned about that, look up a tutorial about turning off the turbo boost since this should rectify the problem that many described.As for graphics, I have been using Flowscape to create ambient animated scenes, and the processor deals with this as well as most high end laptops would. I had a scene with thousands of animated 3d models (plants and particle effects included), and the framerate hovered around 8-10, which is fine for the initial setup of the scene. When I rendered it, it output about 1 frame per second at 4k quality, and the end result was as smooth as butter.Beyond that, it is a good quality, metal body, extremely high resolution machine with a lot of power for only weighing 2 pounds. If you are producing music with 30 different instruments or if you are a professional animator or heavy gamer, then you probably already know that you should spring for a tower with adequate cooling and hardware. If you enjoy moderate/heavy mixing and casual graphics work, this machine is absolutely perfect.The only warning I have is that this does not come with an SD slot. If you are worried about storage space, spring for the model with a bigger hard drive.","Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 – 13.5"" Touch-Screen – Intel Core i7 – 16GB Memory - 256GB Solid State Drive – Sandstone","$1,149.00"
2,Cali,"March 10, 2020",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Tad expensive, but worth it so far.","Bought this as my previous laptop decided to die before my last semester of nursing school. When I was looking into buying laptops, I did a lot of research and was leaning towards a MacBook Pro but couldn’t justify the cost for what the hardware would be offering. Plus limited gaming ability and while I’m familiar with how a Mac operates, I’m most comfortable with windows.This laptop has been awesome, mostly. The look of it is sleek, it handles all my programs for school with ease (which is impressive because the software for taking my exams should be considered a virus at best). The laptop has a great speed, touch pad is sensitive and responsive, and the battery life gets me through the entire day.What’s not so great about it? A couple times I’ll have left the laptop open and go to wake the computer up and it doesn’t respond. Annoying but if I closed the screen and reopen it, it would be fine. One time the laptop was off and wouldn’t turn on, simple google on the phone and already had a fix for it. Also had to turn off the auto adjust for the screen brightness as it was overly sensitive and would constantly fluctuate.All in all, I’m happy with my purchase. There are some things I’d like to be fixed, but I wasn’t willing to spend the money for an even more expensive laptop so I feel like while it is on the costly side, it’s a huge upgrade from what I had and it’s held up great for the past 3 months.","Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 – 13.5"" Touch-Screen – Intel Core i7 – 16GB Memory - 256GB Solid State Drive – Sandstone","$1,149.00"
3,Jon Gilbert,"April 13, 2021",2.0 out of 5 stars,"I probably would not buy this again, for a few different reasons","I probably would not buy this again, for a few different reasons.First let's talk about the magsafe-esque power cord. It's not easy to know if it's actually plugged in: it'll snap to the housing if it's close, but that doesn't mean that it's snapped *into* the port. The light indicating the cable is attached in on the side, so if you're looking down at it you can't tell if it's lit. The power supply is a brick with square, sharp bevels, and I'm left wondering with the low power draw why an existing USB-C port wasn't used.The trackpad is mostly unusable. It's large, which I thought would be great, but that means that while typing minor brushes against it with the meat of my thumb and palm move or re-orient the cursor. Thought you were in this window typing? Nope, now you're over there and half your password is in a slack channel. The Windows 10 setting for ""disable trackpad while typing"" doesn't do that reliably enough to keep it from happening. And, sometimes two-finger scrolling just doesn't work: it'll be fine for hours, then noooope: you are gonna have to drag the cursor over to the scrollbar in the window for about 10 minutes. The trackpad needs to be disabled and an external mouse needs to be used.On the topic of an external mouse: there goes the single USB-A port.When we talk about the bevel, it's impossible to know where the ports along the left-hand side are without lifting the laptop and looking: a small indented dimple or a sticker would go very far towards knowing where to plug in my earphones.Battery life, weight, screen brightness are all relatively par, there's nothing to exclaim or dismiss there. It is a very thin device, but one that still needs an unshapely brick if you want to do anything. It's not a *terrible* device, but it really doesn't do much to make itself *good*, and all the minor and obnoxious annoyances about it add up to a device that you probably don't want.","Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 – 13.5"" Touch-Screen – Intel Core i7 – 16GB Memory - 256GB Solid State Drive – Sandstone","$1,149.00"
4,Gia Catherine Motti,"February 6, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Dreamy function, gorgeous screen, good responsiveness, addictive fun!","When I got my daughter a used Surface Book 2, she fell in love with it. LOVED LOVED LOVED the battery life. And her artistic hand takes full advantage of the tablet mode. Sooo, I got a new Surface Book 3! WOW - I can see why she loves it. Love the inviting keyboard, the responsive BT and I adore the Surface Pen. Screen is GORGEOUS - TV never looked so good. I love the fact that I can take the tablet off and turn it around and reattach it, then still use it like a table, without using the keyboard. LOVE the battery life. This thing literally lasts all day. I'm very impressed. I got the upgraded version with the larger hard drive so I could do Photoshop.  Security features are effective, convenient and responsive.

5,Blissfully Black,"September 12, 2020",5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, so good","I've had my Surface for about a month now and I love it. I'm a writer so it was important for me to have a smaller, thinner laptop that didn't sacrifice keyboard space or screen size. This does that. (I had initially bought a 12.5 inch HP Spectre and returned it because the keyboard was not comfortable at all.)The larger screen dimensions are great but I'm still getting used to it.And it's just a beautiful laptop. Like I feel pretty just using it. lolIt doesn't have a lot of ports and I wish the batter life was longer. Plus I just accidentally walked it into my door frame and it chipped slightly in the back so I don't know how durable it is.I also bought a screen protector since apparently these are notorious for cracked screens.","Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 – 13.5"" Touch-Screen – Intel Core i7 – 16GB Memory - 256GB Solid State Drive – Sandstone","$1,149.00"
6,sg,"May 24, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing product!,"Be aware that the battery needs to be worked in, it may take up to 2-3 weeks for the battery to reach peak performance and usage ability! I recommend ""Pure Battery"" on the Microsoft store to monitor this! The only reason i bring this up is I have seen other buyers post that they have returned the product after a short time of having less than optimal battery performance. This product's battery must be worked in.

7,championshopper,"February 21, 2021",3.0 out of 5 stars,One year in: Decent machine with significant weaknesses,"I have had this computer for about a year, using it all day every work day. In general, its technical performance has been very good (better I would say than the many MacBook Airs I owned before). It handles many large applications and browser windows being open at once.I have come to appreciate the textured surface around the keyboard. It has worn well, despite my concerns when I bought it.The biggest weakness, and it's a big one, is battery life. I'm lucky to get 3-4 hours on any charge, which keeps me plugged in most the time. This is not truly a portable machine.At this point, I'm also concerned about the durability of the case -- just realized that two of the rubber feet on which the laptop sits have broken off, so now it doesn't sit evenly. That's pretty poor workmanship.","Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 – 13.5"" Touch-Screen – Intel Core i7 – 16GB Memory - 256GB Solid State Drive – Sandstone","$1,149.00"
8,Chloe L,"July 24, 2020",5.0 out of 5 stars,Surface Pro to Surface Laptop Convert,"I've owned the Surface Pro 1 and Surface Pro 3. I saw Microsoft was coming out with more ""laptop-esque"" machines but always thought I'd stick with the Pro line forever. However one gripe I had about the Pro series was screen tilt, especially when trying to video chat. Unlike traditional laptops, you can't tilt the screen forward, which makes for awkward angles when video chatting or watching movies, etc. I decided to go with Surface Laptop and I won't be going back! I love this computer. Screen size is awesome and display is clear. Touch is sensitive and responsive. Keyboard is comfortable. And the machine it self is gorgeous.

9,Christopher Hannaford,"October 20, 2020",5.0 out of 5 stars,I just love this computer,"I have bought top-end Sony VAIO 13"" computers for maybe 15 years for mobile use in engineering mainly bc they are so small and light and have NVIDIA graphics cards. My latest is about 5 years old and the screen is failing so I sought a replacement and found this Microsoft surface and am very happy. I really like: island keyboard, facial recognition, fabulous screen resolution, touch screen, small size (about half the volume as VAIO with same screen size). It is just such a clean and friendly design.

17,Ed,"February 15, 2021",2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed with Service and Limited Machine Life,"I liked my Surface -- it was lite, compact, and had a great screen.  I was an Apple user, but the financial software I use is better in Windows.After 13 months, the machine would not start.  Microsoft thought it was the mother board or processor.  For $495, they would send me a furbished machine.  Wonderful.  Good thing I back up regularly.In 25 years of using laptops, never has a machine of mine died so young.  It is inconceivable that the computer would last one year and MS suggested I buy an extended warranty next time.  I suggested they build a better machine that is dependable.  I also put up with the clunky docking station that sometimes worked and sometimes did not.I am getting the refurbished machine but have every expectation that it won't last the year.  If not for the financial programs, I would go back to Apple.

Amazon wouldn't replace the product. I bought the Asurion insurance and instead of giving me a gift card for my purchase, they replaced the motherboard. They did this even after telling me they would give me a gift card to replace my item. Keep in mind I bought my laptop in June and didn't open it until august when I started school. The problem only got worse and I kept having trouble and everyone had me between Amazon, Microsoft, and Asurion. At the end, I still have my so called new laptop with a replaced motherboard. Microsoft will only give you a refurbished if there's a hardware issue. You're better off buying the product from BestBuy and price matching.
