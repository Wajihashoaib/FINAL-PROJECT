0,Knightman,"October 31, 2020",4.0 out of 5 stars,Make sure you are okay with the compromises,"I am pleasantly surprised as I really like the surface laptop Go. I feel like Microsoft missed a home run here with the base model having 4 gb of ram and no fingerprint sensor and then having to go to the next trim at $699 to get the 8 gb ram and fingerprint sensor.  Result: ground rule double.Likes:Design:  it is a nice looking device that stands out from the others in its category. The ice blue is attractive while not the most obvious blue still retains a nice look. The plastic underside does not detract from this either.Size:  It is compact and fairly light.Screen: Despite the sub 1080p resolution, the screen is still attractive and bright with accurate colors.  The 3:2 aspect ratio also makes this a hit because the screen is taller and easier to review documents, because you have to scroll less than a 16:9 aspect ratio.Color options: there are 3 different color options to choose from, options are always good.Ports:  having usb-c and a is great as well as having the device charge from USB-c along with the mag connector for charging.Trackpad:  this is on the nicest trackpads I have ever used as my fingers glide across it.  Mouse movement is great.Price: the base model starts at $550.Fingerprint reader: nice and fast logonPerformance:  all models have an i5 processor and I think this is more than fine for everyday users, even the base model will give you good performance.Neutral:Keyboard: it is okay to type on for me and not as good as the pixelbook go keyboard because it has a somewhat mushy feeling when typing.Screen: it is nice but still it is under 1080p for a device that cost $550 and up. When was the last time you found a device that was not full hd for $500 or up?Sound: I think it sounds decent, not amazing, not a pro or con.Base Model: 4 gb really microsoft you could not have just put an extra 4 gigs in and charge $599.  Why limit it this way? Also no fingerprint reader in base model as well.Battery life: it is in the 7-8 hours territory.  Not amazing but not awful either.Cons:Keyboard: no backlight.  This is the biggest con again when is the last time you had a device over $500 with no backlit keyboard.  It makes typing in poorly lit rooms more difficult and a no fly zone for those who work in darkness.Price:  on the highest tier model Microsoft is really trying to upcharge you just for added storage.$899 just highlights this device's shortcomings even more in that price bracket.Wrap up:  I looked over a bunch of devices in this class and some not in its class.  This is not the quintessential device for me but it is very good.  My biggest gripe is the lack of backlit keyboard on a device in this price range.  I find the screen is very nice looking but the sub 1080p comes across as tacky also.  I feel they could have popped an i3 in the base model and then added the fingerprint sensor.  Avoid the $899 model as that is too much to pay for something so compromised.Also consider:  The Surface laptop 3 is something to consider if you are worried about the compromises being made. It has a backlit keyboard, a full HD+ display and is larger at 13.5 screen display.  It does cost more, and also the bezel around the display is larger.","Microsoft Surface Laptop Go - 12.4"" Touchscreen - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - 256GB SSD - Platinum",$629.00
1,A. Newman,"June 13, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic little laptop,"This is everything I'd hoped for in an ultraportable laptop. Super lightweight, easy to carry around, small enough to fit into a day bag, but still decently powerful. Having an SSD vs eMMC for storage and an i5 for a processor makes this feel much snappier than other similar laptops in this class. This also runs Linux almost perfectly, except for the fingerprint reader. My only gripe is the screen is a little dark when using this outside, but it's not unusable. Overall, highly recommended.","Microsoft Surface Laptop Go - 12.4"" Touchscreen - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - 256GB SSD - Platinum",$629.00
2,kristin t,"March 8, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,Don't Buy Renewed,"I was convinced by Amazon that buying renewed would be beneficial to the world and eco-friendly, so I trusted them and bought a renewed laptop. The laptop itself was great, I actually ended up loving the laptop. Everything worked fine and it seemed like new for the first week give or take... except for the charger. The charger is similar to Apple's chargers in the sense that you can put in in any direction and it should still charge. Well, my charger right out of the box was already problematic and I had to angle it just right to get my laptop to charge.  Fast forward to last night and my charger just stops working. I tried all the different angles and blowing into it and everything but my laptop will just not charge any more. Returning it ASAP since I literally cannot use it any more. /:","Microsoft Surface Laptop Go - 12.4"" Touchscreen - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - 256GB SSD - Platinum",$629.00

7,deljacla,"February 4, 2021",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Some good, some bad.","Edit to original review: This laptop is absolutely horrible. I have not used it for barely ANYTHING because the processor is horrible. I used it to make projects with my printer and cutting machine. The bluetooth disconnects and ruins materials. It literally takes 3 hours to print and cut one sticker sheet because the computer freezes CONSTANTLY. I have zero problems using a different computer for these tasks. The touchpad is also so sensitive that you can’t even use it. You basically HAVE to buy a separate mouse. I hate this laptop and I am NEVER buying another computer from Microsoft. I was prompted to update the OS, and I did and now I can not even start using the computer because I get a MILLION Microsoft ads! How many times must I close Bing windows about Black Friday?!?! This is insanely obnoxious. Every time I change the default browser from Bing to something that doesn’t suck, it changes it back to Bing and I also get a million pop ups about more Microsoft products that I don’t want! It gives me pop ups constantly about emails I never set up ! Do NOT waste your money. This laptop has done nothing but waste TONS of time, money, and my last ounce of patience. I am literally going to smash it with a sledgehammer. Today.Original:  I needed a much better laptop. Initially I was looking for a 2-in-1 (tablet and laptop). I watched some videos and narrowed my selections down. So I knew what to expect going in. Other reviews mentioned how the keyboard is not backlit. I thought this wouldn’t bother me much but now that I have it, it’s pretty annoying, especially because it is a common complaint and surely it is an easy fix, right? This was the cheapest of the 4 new computers I was looking at, and this was $850 with my selection. I probably should have spent a little more I guess. Then I realize that the screen does not detach like the Microsoft Surface Pro 7. Grrr. The screen doesn’t even fold back flat and you can’t use the Surface Pro pen on the screen either!! Gee, must be really good otherwise, right? Not so much. Comes with a ton of bloatware. If you want to use apps you probably use everyday, you have to disable safety mode, or only use Microsoft apps and nobody does that. I do like the aesthetic of the laptop, and the keyboard actually reminds me of my MacBook which has an ancient OS now. The touchpad is great, and so is the keyboard other than no backlighting. It turns on fast! However, this kind of freaked me out: The second time I turned it on, the laptop wasn’t facing me and I already used my finger to unlock it (I thought) but it didn’t work until I got in front of the computer. It made me wonder if it was using my face to unlock like my MacBook. Then it immediately said I was logged into a videoconferencing app that I have never used. I didn’t even realize that app was on this computer and I never created an account for it. I guess Microsoft does what it wants. I removed that app and many more. That was all a big turn off for me. But honestly the biggest complaint is the horrible graphics. My eyesight is not as great as it once was but honestly, the pixelation is bad and noticeable. I installed a photo editing app and even when blowing high resolution images up to edit, it looks worse than really cheap laptops I had 20 years ago. No exaggeration. I have tested this with hundreds of images now. Believe the reviews that mention this! My husband can’t stand when I watch TV on standard definition and that has never bothered me but this screen just looks distorted. I do like that it is small and lightweight. I can slip it in my nightstand and jump on it quickly for quick work stuff and that is great. But I am underwhelmed. Just really consider what the majority of reviewers complain about. If you’re considering any of the Microsoft Surface computers, other models have more to offer.","Microsoft Surface Laptop Go - 12.4"" Touchscreen - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - 256GB SSD - Platinum",$629.00
8,Andrea J,"December 5, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to use,"I'm giving this four stars for everything because I'm not computer-savvy and there may be issues which I haven't encountered or they don't bother me.  The laptop arrived quickly and I was able to get it going without too much trouble (again, because of me and not the machine). The only thing I don't like is having to  'Sign In' all the time but I'll look up how to resolve that.  The keys feel nice; they are not backlit, but I have a little bendable USB plug-in light which illuminates the keyboard but not the entire room.  I'm very happy with my purchase, and it's a nice color, too.  Not too pink.","Microsoft Surface Laptop Go - 12.4"" Touchscreen - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - 256GB SSD - Platinum",$629.00
9,Lydia,"December 15, 2020",4.0 out of 5 stars,Solid Basic Laptop,"I purchased this for work, I originally had the Surface Pro 4 tablet. My work consists of lots of emails, designing marketing promotions and ads in Canva, Microsoft Office (powerpoint, excel and word). So nothing too crazy. I will say when I was moving files over, side by side there is a difference in picture quality. The Surface Pro 4 tablet has a very sharp picture. The Laptop Go is a little fuzzier. I can get used to it and for the price, this is a great laptop (the tablet was about $1,000+). I can feel my eyes straining a little bit to read which may not be great in the long run, so I would say if you're not using this for 40 hours a week you'd be fine. If you are, I recommend either getting a different laptop or upping the font to help eye strain.In regards to the seller, they are awesome. I got the computer quickly. I reached out to them to ask about the resolution and they were quick to respond, and asked that I go to Microsoft to discuss. Would recommend them.","Microsoft Surface Laptop Go - 12.4"" Touchscreen - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - 256GB SSD - Platinum",$629.00
10,Wayne,"February 24, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Go for the 8 Ram or more,I love this little guy. I first purchased the Apple Air and after using it for a week I just didn't like it. Don't get me wrong the Apple Air had a great battery life and key board. I just am so use to windows that some Apple programs I found harder to use. This 8 ram Surface go so far has been doing very well for my needs. It price is a few $100 less then the Apple and it seems just as quiet as the Air. The screen is pretty good not as good as the air but if you don't have them side by side you won't know the difference. I did find a clear plastic cover to fit over my Surface go on Ebay. The cover I got for the Apple Air was easer to find then the one for the Go. All in all so far this laptop seems well built and I'm very happy with how well it works and how well it's built. I love the color  sandstone it's very close to the Apple Gold. Good pick for the money! Seems to be very little fan sound. In fact I never hear it like I did on my older HP laptop.,"Microsoft Surface Laptop Go - 12.4"" Touchscreen - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - 256GB SSD - Platinum",$629.00

16,Lynne S,"October 14, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love my new computer.,"It's a fine, standard laptop for 2020 that isn't expensive. In my opinion, WAY better than Asus Chromebooks. I'm a teacher who has to teach virtually during lockdown, so I'm streaming audio and video all day long. I have to say -- for a relatively inexpensive laptop, it handles the streaming well. It does get overwhelmed and slow down when I'm in 2 or more Google Classrooms simultaneously and have open multiple windows and 20+ tabs, but I don't think the laptop is to blame, more the crazy demands of virtual teaching. The camera is a huge upgrade from my 2011 Asus laptop. WARNING: there's only 1 usb port, so that Anker multi-port plug-in is a MUST. But it's very cheap compared to what Best Buy tried to sell me ($15 vs. $90!!) and works flawlessly. I bought it here along with the laptop.","Microsoft Surface Laptop Go - 12.4"" Touchscreen - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - 256GB SSD - Platinum",$629.00
