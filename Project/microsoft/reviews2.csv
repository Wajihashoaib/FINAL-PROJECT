0,Duhkgeorge,"August 2, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Surface Laptop Studio (SLS) - Review of i7, 16 Ram 500G first gen unit","Quick take/summaryI love the function and feel of this machine.  It is a unique piece of equipment, where I mostly need a laptop, but occasionally I need a tablet for writing.  The slim pen 2 has no lag, which would be a deal breaker for me.Why are there two stars knocked off?  The batter life is not what was advertised and was enough to annoy me.  Standard browsing or video usage, after a few days of use and updates, you can probably expect about 6-8 hours of life.  This is far short of advertised, but that works for me, even if I'm mildly annoyed.  The big kicker is that when you game and the (very quiet and effective) fans come on, the battery life is 30-40 minutes at a full charge.  Something to be mindful of.  If that works for you, add a star for each battery issue that you don't mind, and that may be how you'll find the machine.  It's a beautiful piece of work that I don't regret purchasing, but the battery life is not as long lasting as Microsoft implied and the way they got their test results is not one I'd deem usable unless the room was pitch black.Review set-up:Summary above, Details below.***update 8/29/2022***I've knocked off two stars.  The battery life when using games that require power are is just unusable for more than a short 30-40 minute burst if you were fully charged.  I feel that really limits the usability for anyone who selected the model with the video chip.  I'm mostly annoyed at the false advertising.  The run time is decent if you're just doing every day work, but decent is 6-8 hours, which is also not what was advertised.  I reduced my refresh rate to 60, and that didn't seem to affect the gaming duration.  It was bad either way.Oh, and I also have managed to bump loose the power cord a few times without noticing.  Not as secure as I'd like when actually used on a lap.  On a desk, a non-issue.***update 2022_08_19***Just tried out the kingmaker game with battery only and boy does power drain fast.  If you're using the power with the fan running, I suspect you'll be lucky to get two hours out of the machine.  I got less than an hour, but the battery was not completely full, so heads up.  I have my screen refresh at 120, so maybe I'd get better battery life if I reduced.  I was just surprised it was so short.  My other laptop would chew through batteries when gamming too, but I got more life out of it.The pen, which I thought had a pretty secure magnet, does manage to get knocked loose.  It would be nice if Microsoft had some kind of notification when it disconnected.  I've noticed when I get up from my chair, it's been on my lap, and something falls to the floor.  It's always the pen.  Issues will likely depend on how you use it and if you wear things that can get caught by the pen, but heads up.I'm still happy with the purchase.  The power features I would be unlikely to really use unless plugged in.  In this sense, people that need the power are unlikely to be happy with this machine if they expected that power and prolonged battery life while unplugged.***update 2022_08_15***Finally had some time to load pathfinder kingmaker to the laptop.  The game instantly caused the fan to ramp up to dispel the heat.  The right side became very warm, both where my right hand palm rests while I type, and underneath on the right side.  Warm, but not burning to type on or on the lap.  The ramped up fans move a lot of very warm air, but it's the sound of air moving, and while it's noise, it's not unpleasant or uncomfortable to talk with like many other computer fans I've had.  I give the cooling a good thumbs up, although I was surprised it came on so quickly.***update 2022_08_06***The battery life continues to improve slightly.  2.5 hours of dnd using hero labs, wifi, moderate browsing for rules clarification and minimal sketching burned up about 11% battery life.The machine has been incredibly quiet although I haven't run taxing software yet.  This is all a HUGE improvement over my previous machine where the fan would be constantly on with minimal work and would roar when gaming, when I used to game.I find transitioning between keyboard and note taking/sketching to be an extremely satisfying experience.  I had no idea how much my previous laptop bothered me will all the flaws of the keyboard and touchpad issues I experienced.  I will say the transition can be a little clunky when I'm typing and then need to make a note and then typing again.  I find that I don't like making more than a one-word notation in laptop mode and so I'm switching between both when doing a mixed document.One note handles written text differently than I thought it would.  If you're mixing typed text with written, they act as two separate things.  Hitting enter will move your typed text (if done above) but it won't move what you've written, which will need to be moved separately .  As such, you may want to write to one side, type on the other and then select and combine when done with both to print as a pdf document.***update 2023_08_04***Battery life:  I switched back to 120hz and while the battery is still draining faster, after 4 hours I still have a 55% charge.  Of note, I've been away from my keyboard quite a few times today, but the screen is set to remain on and I also was streaming music for part and there was a lot of internet searching today.  What I am saying is that after all the updates, the battery life for 120hz, while not on par with 60hz, seems greatly improved for basic tasks.  Obviously taxing software will burn through batter life much faster.******What are the key things you should know before buying?Battery Life:The battery life you likely to receive from the unit depends on usage and programs and blah blah blah.  I did a lot of research in this area for real world usage and found that when I change the screen resolution to 60hz, there is a noticeable improvement of the battery life to about 8-10 hours of solid use.  Ten looks like the absolute max.  With the screen at 120hz, I was watching the battery life fall and would guess about 3 to four hours of use.  My usage was browsing, one note, excel, email, and hero labs (a DND character application).  While I have a machine with a video card, I don't tend to game on my laptop, and I haven't played with drafting tools yet.  I have not done long term testing to see if 120hz eventually has an improved battery life after configurations/learnings/updates are all complete.  I switched my machine back to 120hz and it now appears to be draining slower, so maybe?  I would say to plan on my first case scenario, and I'll update if I notice better performance long term.While I can't say Microsoft lies about the battery life, as they provide the ridiculous specs in which they achieve it, I will say that their numbers are misleading based on real world use.Slim Pen 2 and SLS combo:If you're not purchasing this with a pen, you are purchasing the wrong machine.  I believe this machine is specifically for those that need a hybrid work environment.  Drawing concepts in presentations, showing work for math, chemistry, and physics homework, or just sketching design concept ideas.  This machine works well for these things, but all require a pen.  There are cheaper and higher performing machines out there if this is not your need.  Microsoft sells these separately, but they should be purchased together, else, why buy an SLS?There is practically no lag with the slim pen 2!  Lag was my biggest issue with surface and pen technology.  I would not say it is perfect, but when you're looking for rough handwritten notes, this device fits the bill and the slim pen 2 is fantastic.  I won't say it's perfect as zooming in on lines you draw the pen will want to meander, but for real world rough uses, I give it a thumbs up.The magnet to hold the pen is strong and the location is under the touch pad area (to the front, there's a lip on the edge of the device).  Not a perfect connection, but unlikely to be lost when NOT in a bag.  Bags with junk will bump and who knows, so FYI.  It's nice to be out of the way while typing, and available for use.Performance:I can't speak to this.  I don't benchmark, and people can go out there and review that themselves.  I haven't opened up inventor or fusion yet.  I still need to load.  I feel these reviews are all over the internet though, unlike battery and pen usage, so I expect my results will be the same.  I also don't do complex modeling, so my usage in this area would be light and not useful to someone who does it for a living.Note:  This is now a year old and not a powerful computing device.  If performance is a MAJOR concern, you might want to invest in more current machines.  This was not super powerful when it first came out.Keyboard and Pad:The keys click nicely.  May last laptop had very compressed keys (with a T key that started to fail) and this keyboard feels much better.  Key locations feel intuitive.The Keyboard lighting works well and has different brightness options.  I have mine on the lowest.The pad clicks nicely, and I don't accidently bump and click like I did with my other laptop.Windows 11:If you are not used to the operating system, it's a change from windows 10.  I greatly dislike change for the sake of change.  You can read online reviews about the layout.  It's different but I am slowly getting used to it.  I did have to figure out how to navigate and what some of the symbols meant.  You can still pin items to the taskbar, and there are some items you have to change in system and personalization or right click the taskbar and select taskbar settings.After I figured it out, it's fine, but change (grumble grumble)There are also a lot to the system, so poking at the various options to understand how you can tweak your laptop might be good.  But, if you just want it to work, after a slight learning curve it is fine.Stability and set-up:Set-up was pretty easy.  Of note, the power cord has a light on its head opposite to where it connects to the laptop.  This allows you to see if the power is on, if you have a charging issue.  My power strip had been bumped off and I had to google, once I knew there was supposed to be a light and where, it was easy to figure out I had no power and turned the power strip back on.Stability seems mostly good.  No crashes.  The screen orientation changes work but are a bit weird when transitioning.  ""Jumpy"" might be a good way to describe.  Once settled it's all good.The hinge and magnets:This thing is stiff.  A technic to adjust the screen into different positions.  When lying flat I lift the edge closest to me and lift the entire screen fully open, and then I tilt the screen down.  I reverse this when transitioning instead of moving and then trying to transition the screen over the viewing angle I want.  I found this to be much easier and less scrapping.  Otherwise, you're fighting the device, so heads up.The hinge itself seems good.  We will see how it holds up.Quality of build:While parts of the device are metal (screen portion), the base appears to be plastic.  Metal lasts better than plastic, and time will tell how this holds up.  I expect discoloring and scratches on the plastic, and I hope I never drop this.Weight:This is heavier than I thought.  While my last power laptop (incredible fully maxed device that lasted me seven years before the keyboard started dying) was slightly heavier and larger with a 13"" screen, this feels heavier despite being smaller and slightly lighter.  It weighs in at just over 4lbs.  It is smaller and so more dense.  The screen is a great proportion and I feel like there's more viewable space.  My previous laptop had a wide screen, and it wasn't a great use of real-estate for a laptop.Heating:As mentioned, I'm doing everyday tasks and the laptop barely registers as warm on the bottom.  One trend I've noticed with other ""performance"" laptops, is that the containers are too small to appropriately cool the devices and they get incredibly hot (looking specifically at you, Dell, who I will never buy from again).  Already this device is better than a number of other slim ""performance"" laptops I've looked at.What were my primary motivations in purchasing and who might this work well for:People who need to draw to communicate ideas.People who need a long battery life.People who need a portable device that doesn't lag when writing and they need to write.People who hate putting keyboards on the surface of a table or lap because... it just seems wrong.People who need some power, but are okay with a non-top of the line machine.People who are okay spending premium money for a lower spec'd item that fits the above unique needs.Overall?I knocked off a star due to specifications, but the machine works exactly as I hoped, and I am enjoying my interaction with it.  I understand why so many compare it to a mac.  Apple products have a great ""feel"" to them, and this laptop definitely replicates some of that if not all of it.Final note:If you purchase, defintely look up various issues that might be important to you.  I found reviews tended to be very superficial and even biased.  I found that looking up issues (battery life, heating, crashing, etc.) helped me weed out some of the machines I was looking at.  It wasn't that none of the machines had negative reviews, but more the quantity of negative reviews compared to others.  The SLS definitely has had negative reviews, but the amount compared to others I was looking at were significantly less, so I took a leap at the high price tag, and so far I'm happy.I will update as I run into changes and get a feel for the performance of the piece too.  I hope this helped.","Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio - 14.4"" Touchscreen - Intel® Core™ i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Platinum","$1,590.00"
1,Nuhash Mashud,"February 22, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,Very good but has flaws and definitely not for everyone,"Now let me preface this by being clear. I am an undergraduate computer science student. My father pretty much gave this computer to me as a gift during Christmas just for something to take notes on. I use the Whiteboard app a lot in fact to be able to take notes on it. I understand that you could type out the notes on a computer or whatever but I prefer using a notebook but at the same time I need to know what I'm writing about and a notebook can only grant me so much space. So this may not be a device for everyone but it is for me at least for the version I got.After two months with this product I could safely say this is a very good product that Microsoft has made. I have used it a little for drawing here and there and it does a fine job and for note-taking it's a great device with a bit of flaws.Goods*The screen is extremely high-quality. The gloss may turn some people off but I think it's great it does get a little dusty but that's easy to clean up.*The mouse pad is great. It reminds me of the MacBook mouse pad but it's much more responsive and smooth.*The keyboard took me time to get used to, especially considering this is the first time I ever used the laptop without any num keys.*The speakers get as loud as I want them to be but audio definitely sounds crisp and extremely high quality.*The way that the device switches from laptop mode to tablet mode is pretty simple for the most part, there is one thing that however concerns me but I'll get to that later I like the little bit of tilt that it has on the upper level because it gives me a better elevation to where I want to write.*The magnets are really helpful and strong when it comes to me putting the pen close to the computer.Bads*The battery life because it runs out very fast whenever I'm using the device like I was in class for 50 minutes one time and it drained very fast. I was at full100% battery and at the end of class it drained to 36%.*No USB ports I know more devices are using the USB C Port right now but the limited amount of the USB option really does bug me personally considering that I still have more devices that uses a standard USB cable over a USB C I understand that I could probably buy an adapter for that or whatever but it would have been nice to have more options for the device rather than just 2 USB C port. I'm not saying they should go all in and include two USB ports on the left and one on the right but at least one would have been nice.*There's no way to lay the screen flat on the table in tablet mode. This is one of the biggest problems because one thing I liked about other surface devices is that they would allow me to position the device anyway I wanted. However with this one you don't get as many options all you get was the flat bit tilted tablet mode and a viewing mode as you could say. This brings me to the biggest problem with the device and this may sound minor to many people but for me it kind of scares me.*The tablet to laptop mode hinges scares me to the point where I think if I bend it enough it's going to break. I'm not sure when it will happen but I will make sure to update people when it does. Because the device looks very sensitive and again it scares me and I usually don't get scared of this type of thing but I am for this one. When I am writing or drawing I exert a lot of pressure on a table surface or notebook that is how I feel comfortable when I write or draw and on this device I get scared every time I do something like that.*It is a little overpriced for it's specs and functionality.  256gb ssd is good but for $1,500 that's too much. Considering that there are laptops with the same functionality and better specs this was a bit expensive for what it is.Overall this is a great device may not be for everyone but it is great non the less for me. It will not automatically replace a tablet for those that have one and may not be the best tool for artist. But considering that there are people that may want a device that has the same functions of a tablet but also be able to use it as a computer this is a very good device for them if they are ok with the pricing. Keep in mind the version that I bought was not ment for gaming I didn't buy it to play video games, so for those that are getting this there is gonna be alot of restrictions when it comes to gaming.","Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio - 14.4"" Touchscreen - Intel® Core™ i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Platinum","$1,590.00"
2,R. Winningham,"July 24, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Artist or Developer, this is the laptop for you","I’ve had the pleasure of using three different Surface Laptop Studios. They each far exceed my expectations.I currently have one at work and one at home. (I don’t like mixing work and home on the same computer). This means I have one to pamper and one to abuse. I won’t disclose which is which.My background: I’m a senior software engineer for a Fortune 300. I need virtualization, horsepower, and flexibility at work (Visual Studio, Docker, Kubernetes). I’m also a 3D artist at home (Blender, TopoGun, Maya, 3DS, Chitubox, etc.).When I have to, I use Office.My usage patterns are all over the place.First: I was skeptical of the “cloth hinge”. I flipped the hinge over and over for two days. I can safely say, I t’s not gonna wear out quickly.Having used Wacom products for years, I didn’t know what to expect from “the pen”.The Physical Pen Integration is well thought out. It pairs, charges, and stores in a well hidden (and easily accessible) location. The Pen is also well integrated with the latest version of leading artists’ software.From an artist’s standpoint, when you draw on the screen, you’ll probably need an external keyboard. I haven’t tried “the dial”. The “feel” is different from a Cintiq. It’s a bit squishy, but acceptable if you can adapt.Windows Home can be easily upgraded to Enterprise with the appropriate ISO and Product Key.I would prefer a larger amount of available RAM. 32 GB is too little for me. (Apple has 64GB laptops, just sayin’).This is probably “more laptop” than the average user would need. It’s also on the heavy side.The Screen-Flipping-Feature isn’t for everyone. Although, it does more than you’d expect. It allows you to tilt the screen forward (over the keyboard) when using an external keyboard. You can also flip the screen away from you and use the computer as a Hotel Movie Screen.Unfortunately, The Pen isn’t included.Heavier than anything “traditional”Anything but “traditional.”","Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio - 14.4"" Touchscreen - Intel® Core™ i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Platinum","$1,590.00"
3,NYGarlic,"August 21, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I had hoped for,"As I reviewed this, it has been three days since I've received the Laptop Studio.There's been some getting used to and some adjustments that I had to make. So partially this has been with the Laptop Studio or with Windows 11 (since it came installed with Windows 11).For the device, had some problems such as it not charging when I plugged it in. I thought maybe it was my charger's issue (even thought it was working fine the previous evening) so I went and tried another charger - still didn't work. Had to search online, and seems like others experienced the same issue. Had to do a hard restart in order for it to work.Another issue was that the time was two minutes fast. Checked the settings and it said it was not synced since 2015. Was the Studio Laptop even around since 2015? Had to manually change the time but eventually was able to sync the time to auto update.Another issue is when I move a handful of folders from one directory to another. It will move but will leave copies of the folders (empty) in the original location. Freaked me out as I thought something happened to my files.Initially, the screen would flicker. Encountered it a handful of times so I did a google search on a solution. Some people said to open up Nvidia Control Panel but when I did that, NCP would just disappear. Had to google search for a solution there too.My biggest issue with the Laptop Studio is how slow it is. I'm the type of person who has a TON of tabs but still my old Surface Book 2 was able to handle it at 16GB RAM. This device has 32GB RAM and is suffering. I thought maybe it was the Chrome and Opera not optimized for Windows 11 but when I tried to open a folder on my desktop, it struggled too. There's a lag in everything I do.*****Also, Amazon royally screwed up my order. They initially sent me the wrong item; Surface Pro 7. So I wanted to exchange it but they said it's a third party so they cannot exchange. They wanted me to return it and buy it again. NOT as simple as exchanging it but fine. Even when the Surface Pro 7 was delivered back to Amazon, they don't initiate the return. So I contact Amazon to initiate the return, they then initiate the return for the SECOND PURCHASE!

4,Amazon Customer,"June 15, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Multi-use Laptop,"As a student looking to convert to a more digital format in terms of notes and schoolwork, this laptop is great! I've had it several months now and I use it with a surface pen to take notes with it as if it was a regular pen-and-paper notebook. The processor and graphics card also allow me to run all of my favorite video games smoothly without any technical difficulties. It is a large computer and is a bit more heavier than I would've preferred, but overall that's something I'm willing to sacrifice to be able to have everything in one place. The only real grudge I have with it is the battery life. If you're not running anything particularly battery consuming (ie. video games) it usually can last a few hours. However, be prepared to watch your battery levels drop when you play even 5 minutes of your favorite PC game.Overall, if you're looking for a tablet-computer that can handle heavy loads and is a bit less pricey compared to it's Apple and Dell counterparts, this computer might just become your next best friend.","Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio - 14.4"" Touchscreen - Intel® Core™ i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Platinum","$1,590.00"

6,J. Graham,"April 7, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best laptop I’ve ever purchased!,"First of all: I am a tech junky and have bought a dozen, or more, portable computers over the years. I generally end up frustrated with poor screen quality, misrepresented battery stamina, poorly backlit (or not at all) keyboard, poor trackpad, or something else I didn’t know prior to purchase.I bought two. One for my wife, one for me. I chose the 32GB with 11th Gen Intel i7 CPU with independent NVIDIA GE Force 3050 RYX graphics card. This is one absolutely impressive computer after 5-days. Windows 11 takes a little getting used to. It’s not bad, just a little different. Eventually you have to upgrade so we’ll all have to switch at some point.Battery appears to last over 13-hours with screen as bright as it gets. It has zero lag switching apps. It seems much “lighter” than prior OS.It is a little heavy to be truly portable, but you could choose the 13” display instead of the 14.4”. I’m sure the long lasting battery is responsible for the overweight laptop.I will use it “in-dock” 85% of the time running two 35” monitors, multiple data hog financial streaming apps, desktop version of MS Outlook and a ton of browser windows tabs. With the quality and quantity of RAM I suspect it’ll be just fine, but I will update after a while operating that glut of functions.Concluding my rambling review, I love the MS Surface Studio 14.4” w 32GB and 1TB SSD. If I had to say something negative it’d be that the generic dock the claims to work with it does not work in my ZIP code. Pay up for the MS branded dock. Use quality cables and plug strips to get the most out of your Surface.Go ahead and buy yours!

7,Steven Harder,"April 13, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Almost perfect,"I bought the Surface Laptop Studio along with the Acer ConceptD 7 Ezel in order to compare them. The color and contrast on the Acer were obviously much better, and the Slim Pen 2 gets jittery when drawing slowly/carefully. However, the Surface display gets much brighter, and writing/drawing on it feels much more natural, mostly because of the awkward aspect ratio on the Acer and a very noticeable gap between its display and digitizer. I had also anticipated that the three set positions for the screen on the Surface might compare poorly against the Acer's infinitely variable ""Ezel"", but it didn't end up bothering me at all. I tend to use the middle position, where the display sits between the keyboard and touchpad, even when I'm holding it in one arm and using it in portrait mode. For some reason it just works for me.The speakers on the Surface are very impressive. It's quite a bit louder than my MacBook Pro, though not quite as pleasant to watch movies on, since the display has less contrast and the audio isn't as full on the low-end. The Acer's speakers are a complete joke, but all of this is really a side note, since I wouldn't use either device for watching movies and I use studio monitors for audio. Really, my only complaint about the Surface is the stupid, stupid, stupid proprietary ""Surface Connect"" charging/docking port (don't waste your money on the dock, since there is no way to use it without continually charging the laptop and inevitably ruining your battery, ""kiosk mode"" notwithstanding). The fact that the Surface with $400 of accessories still costs $1200 less than the ConceptD certainly doesn't hurt.Ultimately, I returned the Acer and I have no regrets.","Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio - 14.4"" Touchscreen - Intel® Core™ i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Platinum","$1,590.00"

The screens looks fantastic and works amazing in conjunction with the Surface Pen 2. Great build quality, and all-around very happy. I was hesitant about the notched body, but it really isn't much of a bother, and it allows for the fans to run super quietly/efficiently, so it works out for the better.","Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio - 14.4"" Touchscreen - Intel® Core™ i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Platinum","$1,590.00"
10,Kirishiro Yamazaki-Triendl,"February 20, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,A machine suitable for studio usage with questionable quality control,"I have to say that this is the second Microsoft Surface product I have purchased over the course of four years. Previously I have a surface laptop 2 for my wife, and it seems not powerful enough to handle the school work she has to design for students. Everything looks vivid on the screen, and the aluminum chassis screams for supreme quality. However, that is not what you have expected. Within the first week, the first unit came up with a vertical green line on the screen. The troubleshooting steps provided by Microsoft are miserable. Ironically, feedbacks from the user communities are surprisingly good. (How the heck a tech giant failed to accomplish an entry level introduction to test their devices?)Amazon pushed us to visit Microsoft for RMA, which costs us $19.99 for shipping even it is their quality issue. I don’t understand why the shipping costs exist in the first place.The second unit seems to be alright after one month use. However, the USB C to display output seems not stable. It could be the issue with the chipset design.Overall, it is a 11th gen intel CPU, but only with 4 cores. If you really consider it as a “studio” machine, you are…….

It can handle some midium weight gaming no problem; fast and stable while drawing (the pen is pretty good btw); the design is also very clean and good looking.

13,Solomon T. Hutchinson,"January 18, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Epic Laptop for Office + Photo Editing/Video Editing (and home Tablet Use)!,"Super happy with this laptop. I use it for some fairly heavy photo/video editing and as my daily/travel laptop. It functions perfectly as my daily work laptop (email, office suite, contracts, budgets, etc.), but has sufficient processing capacity and memory to support my photo/video editing. As a HUGE plus, the fact that this folds flat as a tablet has ensured that I pretty much never use my older iPad anymore as this replaces that device as well for home/couch use. In short, i've been super happy with this device and would recommend it to anyone. I'd also recommend pairing with the new Microsoft Dock 2 as it allows for connecting to all peripherals + multiple monitors. My only beef with the Surface Studio is that it has only  (2) USB 3 ports and (1) audio port (nothing else) which means you need a USB 3 hub for peripherals on the go (including card readers, etc.). All that said, its a very small complaint given the balance of the benefits/quality of the device.","Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio - 14.4"" Touchscreen - Intel® Core™ i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Platinum","$1,590.00"

19,Edimarcos,"November 28, 2021",3.0 out of 5 stars,Touchpad is very disappointing,"My unit has weird behavior of the touchpad. When haptic feedback works it sounds like double click. Sometimes after waking up from sleep a very light touch would activate haptic feedback. Only after sometime this issue goes away. Unfortunately, I have to send it back. Too bad that Amazon doesn't provide a replacement :(UPDATE:I checked unit in Best Buy and it has absolutely same sensitivity issue. It doesn't have double clicking sound when I press though. I'd say that initially you going to be satisfied with this product but at some point you'll start noticing some issues such as:- Sometimes pointer would jump back to a previous position when you press touchpad. It looks like a software glitch, but over course of 6 months it wasn't addressed  (you can search on Reddit about other people reporting this issue).- You'll notice sometimes after pulling laptop out from a backpack touchpad becomes very sensitive. You won't be able to figure for a long time what's going on, but eventually you'll find out that putting laptop to sleep and flipping it upside down for 10 seconds reproduces issue. Weird, huh?- Eventually, in tablet mode you'll find out when you press on the screen near one of the edges it moves and slightly hits laptop's base which produces annoying sound. That happens because display is slightly bent in the middle on that side. You'll take a ruler to figure if that's true and you'll find that not only that side is bent/bowed but all sides of display aren't straight. It might be normal though but I'm not sure if it should be this way. I see that other laptops I own have some sort of curvature, but I never noticed it because that laptop do not have touch displays.If you decide to buy this laptop then you should lower your expectations below MacBook Pro (I own 2019). Just put its quality at the level of all other laptops out there cuz it's neither better nor worse.Keyboard is good though :)","Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio - 14.4"" Touchscreen - Intel® Core™ i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Platinum","$1,590.00"
20,JBSmoove2,"August 7, 2022",1.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for about 20 days.  Then it started to buzz.,"This feels like, and looks like a premium product.  I think that MS is on to something with this design.  However, after about 1/2 a month the thing started buzzing, sizzling, and popping like something out of a roadside diner.  Not certain why, but every power source I tried, only caused a loud whining sound to emit from the computer, and for the amount of money that MS charges for this machine, that's not acceptable.This wasn't the case when I first took it out of the box, but I can't sit in a room with a computer making that sort of noise.  I was worried that the buzzing/sizzling/popping was just the start of a cascading series of failures so back it went.","Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio - 14.4"" Touchscreen - Intel® Core™ i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Platinum","$1,590.00"

27,Brian Asquith,"April 10, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Solid - a great alternative to Surface Pro and improves upon the Surfacebook - pleasure to use.,"I bought the Laptop Studio (SLS) to create digital art on a Windows system with the option to use for std home/work tasks.  I initially bought the Surface Pro 8 but the detachable keyboard and kickstand felt flimsy/awkward - the solidity of the SLS fills the niche between the Pro and the Surfacebook.It's a robust device - solid design, with MS addressing the shortcomings of the Surfacebook (hinge, detachable tablet, top heaviness) with the interesting folding design to turn the SLS ""laptop"" into a ""tablet"".The SCREEN is great, but while on paper the Pro seems to only have a slightly higher resolution, the Pro is noticeably higher in actuality.  The 14.4"" screen offers a lot of real estate, excellent for digital art - note it is also very reflective/glossy.The SLIM PEN is excellent - the haptic feedback gives an improved handling sensation compared with the plastic nib on glass typical of other systems - artists definitely it a try, it might be a gamechanger for you.The SPEAKERS do a great job - mostly listen to EDM, and while the speaker size limits the fullness of the bass, I've listened to music on the SLS for 12+hrs without aural fatigue.KEYBOARD and TRACKPAD both function well - touch typing is well accommodated.Reviews I read prior to purchase were largely written at the time of release, Oct 2021, many complained that the PRICE was too high.  MS has since reduced the price ($1800's for i7, 16GB RAM, 512 GB SSD, NVIDIA GeForce Rx), which somewhat mitigates the complaints.  This SLS configuration is also 4lbs, which isn't light!The one design issue I have is the COOLING VENTS exhaust to the front of the laptop (unlike every other laptop I've used) - it feels weird having hot air blowing over your hands/wrists and the front of the laptop can get quite warm.  Also, the SLS would surely look excellent in black, but currently only platinum is available (maybe as a result of the sliding screen would scratch up the black surface).I've largely used the SLS plugged-in, but from the little use of the battery, it does seem that the battery life is mediocre - brightness and setting to screen refresh 60Hz helps matters.From a week or so of use, it is an enjoyable experience - it has a couple of shortcomings but IMHO it is the best device out there in the Surface line of devices.","Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio - 14.4"" Touchscreen - Intel® Core™ i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Platinum","$1,590.00"

I have a Samsung pro 360 also and the Surface studio blows it away.  I have owned hundreds of laptops from Compaq in the 1980's to Surface laptop 3.

Great for presentations.  I highly recommend the surface studio laptop.  I also own a MacBook Pro 16 and am planning to sell it.

Why does Microsoft charge $7/month to use their software even on their own hardware?Also, the stylus made for this laptop is sold separately and costs another $120.It's unfortunate that they created such a great piece of hardware only to feel like a Chromebook knockoff because they can't include software.

El panel táctil (trackpad) deja un poco que desear en cuanto a tacto y respuesta, lo alterno con un mouse inalámbrico Microsoft.Los aspectos negativos son varios:- El peso: es un ladrillo, excesivamente pesado, no se entiende. No es agradable para viajar, ni para moverlo de sitio.- Se recalienta demasiado, a pesar del diseño de evacuación del calor que tiene, se pone muy caliente al tacto.- El sonido no es nada excepcional, los parlantes están disimulados debajo del teclado y creo que ello disminuye su eficiencia. Existen soluciones mejores en el mercado.- Lo peor: ¡la batería no dura! Microsoft anuncia un día de trabajo, en lo personal se me pone en modo de ""ahorro de batería"" después de unas 5 a 6 horas de uso normal (navegación Internet, mails, Word, Excel, WhatsApp, nada fuera de lo normal).Por el precio que pagué me siento engañado y muy frustrado.

37,Chris,"November 20, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Unreliable hardware, no international support, slow processor","This is my third Surface device from Microsoft, and I had very, very good luck with SP4 and SP6). And so, I purchased the i7 32GB RAM 2TB option. Having the ability to fold and rotate the screen to portrait mode really helped with certain types of data displays— that was great! That it was equipped with a somewhat dated i7 processor wasn’t a serious performance issue, as having a fast SSD and lots of RAM makes up for the somewhat slower/older i7 CPU that this is equipped with. However, the Surface Studio Laptop just lasted 4 months before the display failed suddenly and completely while on a work trip from the US to the UK. It seems that, while rare, hardware failures can happen with any computer. On a related note, I had a hardware failure with the SP4 when it was fairly new, and that was sorted quickly by Microsoft. And so, I had high hopes for a solution while I was traveling internationally for work.Unfortunately, I found out that these devices are apparently limited to support from the country you bought it from— and so, if you are not working internationally then likely not an issue for you. But if you to travel internationally for work, it may present a problem (even if you purchase the premium Microsoft support/warranty). Apparently, the UK does not support US purchased Microsoft devices (though they were really very polite about it, I was out of luck). And so, I will be borrowing customer’s computers to do demos until I can return to the US to have my nearly-new Surface Laptop Studio replaced with a refurbished one (Microsoft replacements under warranty are often refurbished units).","Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio - 14.4"" Touchscreen - Intel® Core™ i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Platinum","$1,590.00"
