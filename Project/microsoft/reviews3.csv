1,Amazon Customer,"October 2, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Replaced my laptop and ipad,"I use this as my go to school/work laptop, as well as a drawing display. For both the surface works well, switching between modes is flawless and the pen is very responsive. I got the matte black one, and while i like the color it does chip easily, with light usage there is some chips in the paint but that is to be a expected with matte colors, they just don't hold up as well. I would not recommend getting matte black for a child or if you are a heavy user. Another thing is that the batter doesn’t last long when using the surface continuously even when on battery saver, I'm a student so there are times where i could be using it for hours at a time, pretty much after 4 hours I’ll have to plug it in. Which leads me to the charger itself, the connector is magnet based and not a real port so to speak, so its very weak. If you’re like me and you like to use laptops on the couch or in bed its going to constantly come unplugged from shifting and movement. Its very annoying i wish it was just a normal charging port. The battery and charging port are the main reasons i rate this 4/5 stars, the decision to get matte black was on me so ill take that L, but over all i do like this laptop/tablet. I don’t use this for gaming so I don’t know how it holds up there, but i cant imagine having steam, discord, and whatever other apps open and having it run just as well as a dedicated desktop, this is more of a light work laptop. As i said before i do use this for drawing and for that it does hold up well. I typically have a few chrome tabs open and a large canvas while drawing (5600x6000px 600dpi) and even when i get up to 40 layers i don't experience lag. And unless you’ve got eagle eyes, you wont notice any delay from the pen, unless you’ve got some high stabilization settings. If you’re looking to upgrade your laptop or looking to consolidate your tech, this is a great product. This totally killed my need for my ipad and runs way better than my old 2017 laptop, so much so that i ended up selling both of them.Some notes:- the pen is sold separately but i do recommend getting it if you plan on drawing or using the surface to write notes.- if you plan on getting a keyboard with it I recommend the brydge surface wireless keyboard, the hinges are strong and really make the surface feel like a laptop","Microsoft Surface Pro 7 – 12.3"" Touch-Screen - 10th Gen Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory – 1TB SSD – Platinum","$2,300.00"

3,Jennifer,"April 15, 2020",5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE this device,"The portability and comfort of the tablet with the functionality of a full-fledged laptop. I bought a Surface 3 several years ago and now... I can't go back. I love these things too much. It comes with me everywhere. If you're wondering why buy a Surface which is twice the price of a laptop, here's why:1. If you read a lot of pdfs or e-books there is no comparison.  Using the pen on pdfs, the ability to jot down notes in word or pictorial form, the ability to create links to other information that can later be clicked on: Unmatched anywhere else  Turn it sideways and it's a full sheet of paper for writing and notetaking  Turn it sideways to read Comic Books! OMG!  I'll be honest, I'm a gamer and this is my gaming buddy. I pull up ESO maps and One Note allows me to mark up the maps I find online to check off what I've accomplished, rearranged, plan, it's incredible2. Versatility  I watch a lot of movies and tv on my advice. It's comfortable, easy to hold, just the right size screen, phenomenal graphics and good sound  As previously stated, I read on my device  I am a student. I Word Process. A LOT  I am an Excel nut. I spreadsheet like a crazy person. I attach a mouse and organize my life.  I spend a ton of time using video conferencing on this thing3. Physical Perfection (OK so it is not as light as your tablet but for what it can do, totally worth the extra weight which isn't that much)  Just the right size screen which is totally touch and pen friendly  Good battery life and easy and fast to charge. Not so happy about the way the charger connects with the longer part of the charger pointing down which makes it super easy to accidentally dislodge the magnet (CON 1)In my opinion, this is the perfect electronic for my lifestyleSo, what's wrong with it?Only one USB port and no place to insert extra storage or portable storage without using your only USB portNo MICRO SD Card slotThe Charger connection is A. Not universal and B. Stupidly located. You'd think Microsoft would have figured out by now that if you use a laptop ON your lap it'll get disconnected due to poor locationBUY THE KEYBOARD! If you want a tablet, buy a tablet, If you want a computer you need a keyboard why doesn't it just come with one?Bottom line is this. If you need something versatile and not specialized, this is your computer. It's worth the money. If you're looking for something to run a specialized program or a gaming computer, this is probably not your computer. It's not the most powerful device on the market but it is by FAR the most versatile. I could not recommend a better device for students. Buy a protective case, throw it in your backpack, purse, tote, car, suitcase, whatever let it become a part of you, you won't regret it. It is my travel buddy carrying my movies, books and work with me wherever I need to go.","Microsoft Surface Pro 7 – 12.3"" Touch-Screen - 10th Gen Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory – 1TB SSD – Platinum","$2,300.00"

5,Phil K.,"April 25, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Hard to tell it's refurbished!  Battery life a bit lower than expected.,"Many reviews said they didnt get what they paid for, in my case that did not apply.  I got a like new, Surface Pro 7 with the promised processor, memory and drive.For what I paid, the upgrade from my Pro 4 is amazing.  I decided to get a dock and let this take over not only my laptop needs but desktop also.The only 'con' I have is the battery life seems to be fairly short.  Sitting on the table in sleep mode took 33% of the battery after 12 hours. I wouldn't think that would deplete the battery just sitting there.  May have to find out if that can be replaced.  But the usb-c port allows me to plug in to my dock and not only have the ability to connect my sound system, mouse, scanner, keyboard, etc. with just one little plug....AND IT CHARGES!","Microsoft Surface Pro 7 – 12.3"" Touch-Screen - 10th Gen Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory – 1TB SSD – Platinum","$2,300.00"
6,Anthony Griffis,"May 6, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,It's good for what I need it for.,"I wanted a tablet that could double as a laptop so I could write and practice drawing on.

7,Anthony,"February 23, 2020",1.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t buy the surface pro 7 from amazon,"Well where do i start..... i ended up getting my item and everything was good for about 20mins of use... however after 20mins my screen would freeze for 10-30 secs. I blew it off at first but then it happen 10mins after then it became a often issue. So i ended up going for an exchange. (The worst idea I’ve ever had). I called up amazon and told them my issue and they were quick to get me a replacement so as first i was satisfied until the surface pro 7 came in the next day. I open the box to find out the box it comes in is not only damage but in a renewed box didn’t even come in the same box it should have come in, then i open that to see the surface pro and the screen film wrapped around it was really dirty as if they dropped it in dirt or so and fingerprints all over the machine. So at this point I’m just hoping it works. This one was not charged at all at 15% like it usually is if you were to buy from Microsoft or an apple device would normally be. So i put it on the charger to find out that it not only has screen tear straight down the middle of the screen but a big red dot half the size of the screen was on there as if they drop the surface pro. So at this point i immediately call amazon and i talked to a representative that ended up giving me a hard time about another replacement even though this one was obviously there fault. So i ended up talking to a supervisor that ended up giving me a hard time as well and in the she said to me that they only do a exchange once but as a one time exception they’ll do the exchange to which i responded with i only want to do the exchange if it’s a brand new product that they are giving me not a renewed one and undamaged. To which she agreed that she would make sure it would be done and put in her notes so the wear house  knows. Well the next day came and guess what.... the man that drops it off throws my package at the wall of my house from a big distance he didn’t see me at all so when i raced over the man jumped in his car and quickly drove away knowing what he did. Not only this but when i open the box the surface pro again was in a dirty renewed box, at this point I’m just hoping it still even worked again no power so i plug it in and guess what it works surprisingly after all that. However i Notice something was different with the boot up process so i knew something was wrong i go to the setting of the computer and the version i bought was 8gb of ram i5 model with 128gb of memory the one i receive as a replacement this time was a 4gb version i5 model with 128gb of memory and GUESS WHAT A DIFFERENT GRAPHICS CARD AS WELL. The surface pro 7 i got not only had 4gb of ram which was wrong but a different graphics card as well that comes in a surface pro 5 are you serious.... so i called up customer service again asking for a supervisor yet again..... just wanting a refund the man told me well i see here that you have a couple of exchange for this device already so i told him this story i am telling now and ask him i wonder why i have “a couple of exchanges” to which he said well instead of a refund i can get you a brand new one and told me how he had to make a couple of phone calls to do this for me so i told him this is the last exchange I’ll be getting ill be asking for a refund next like i previously wanted..if the next one comes in the renewed box which that would mean it’s used.. if it’s broken or the wrong model I’m done with trying and I’m done with the surface pro 7. not only was this the worst experience with amazon that I’ve ever had and worst costumer Service but now I’m going to hate the surface pro 7 because of this. I’ll see what i receive next as of 02/23/2020Sorry for the long review but i felt my experience should be shared for others to see.","Microsoft Surface Pro 7 – 12.3"" Touch-Screen - 10th Gen Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory – 1TB SSD – Platinum","$2,300.00"
8,M. P,"October 17, 2020",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great tablet and touch screen computer for travel- limited apps available though,"Great for travelers who need a functional computer that can also serve as a tablet. I got th Surface Pro 7 because I travel for work and will also be starting grad school so I may need to study on the plane or after work in the hotels. I wanted the full functionality of a computer that would allow me to use MS Office programs as well as the functionality of a touch screen, tablet and inking feature to take notes for class. I am just getting accustomed to the inking feature but I can see that it will be a great asset to me during my program and I enjoy the overall portability of the Microsoft Surface Pro 7.  The screen size is just right for me as I don’t like large computers. I have also purchased a wireless keyboard and mouse for when at home to make it even easier to use when typing papers or working on projects. I also purchased a cute flowered skin with white. sage, pink and gray to protect the metal from any nicks or scratches.  I also purchased the silver pen and got a sage green skin to protect it. I like that the pen magnetically attaches to the side of the Surface Pro 7 and that the pen can erase using the eraser on the pen. The only reason I gave it four rather than five stars is that I am finding that not all apps are offered in the Surface Pro that I currently have. The selection seems quite limited and you can’t get apps from iTunes or Google Play as neither service is compatible with Windows. I am most disappointed that Scribd is not offered as I was hoping to be able to read books while in flight. I have read that there is VM Ware apps that may work. I am not very technical so I don’t know much about it. I appreciate any suggestions from Microsoft or techies on how I can upload Scribd on my Surface Pro 7.

A week later I received a brand new still in the unopened Microsoft packaging surface pro 7. It runs absolutely great on performance mode and charges fast really fast.

15,Tom Johnston,"March 5, 2020",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great school tablet,"I really like this Surface Pro 7. It is exactly as advertised with one exception. The battery life is nowhere near what is advertised. On battery saving mode, using only Onenote for taking class notes, it lasts about 4 hours. Fortunately it charges up very quickly though. I can't see any way that I would get a full days use out of a full battery charge in any circumstance. In my case that is not very important because I am always around an outlet but if you need a tablet that will last all day away from a power source you will have a problem. The camera is good enough, not as good as the Apple camera, but I don't really use it as a camera anyway. I use mostly the 365 programs and find that it integrates these programs seamlessly. Onenote comes with the tablet and has been an amazing app for my vet school classes.  It saves my many hours of study time. My only issues are with the instability of Onenote. It closes itself down every few minutes and is very frustrating. I'm sure there is a fix for this but I'm also sure that I won't get it from Microsorft as they have a technical support team that is on par with the customer service team at the cable company. I've contacted them 3 times now and my issue is never addressed. I was actually told to contact Amazon since they sold it to me. It seems like after spending a thousand dollars on Microsoft products they would at least provide a bit of tech support.  I'll just have to scour the web for a fix to this I guess. Overall I would recommend this tablet to every student. It seems to be a fantastic and fast machine.","Microsoft Surface Pro 7 – 12.3"" Touch-Screen - 10th Gen Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory – 1TB SSD – Platinum","$2,300.00"

There were a few small dirty marks on the inside of the packaging. It was sealed and in the original box. I purchased this from here brand new along with the insurance.

20,Tony,"June 27, 2020",5.0 out of 5 stars,The quality I need in a laptop with a few setbacks,"This is my first purchase of a laptop and any surface product. I did my research on the device before purchasing because I'm doing remote learning and an art major so I already knew what I wanted in a laptop and the pro 7 delivered! I bought this laptop as new so I don't know the case for the rest of these reviews but mine came in the box sealed with plastic NEW WITH EVERYTHING WORKING. Screen works perfect as a laptop/tablet and connects well with my hotspot. The only downside is that I paid so much hoping for the sim card or esim option to be there but it wasn't and although the battery still needs improvement I find that if you allow the laptop to rest every hour the battery drains less. I work so I don't have to use it every second but something to keep in mind.Update: Turns out this laptop has a tendancy to freeze a lot, so if your wifi is top tier you should have no worries. When I use public wifi (which I hate doing), im able to load pages etc. When i use my hotspot (not on my phone) it takes 5 minutes just to load a simple search. This wasn't the case when i first got it, and I even increased the gigs on my hotspot just for it to run. Also, portable chargers dont work unless you get the same magnetic charging chord with usb at the end and a portable with 10000mah.

I was looking for something that had the horsepower for what I needed, but also the lightness to carry it around. Although battery life isnt, the best, I DON'T MIND!This thing is a beast! Im very happy running programs like tableau, zoom, excel, powerpoint, all at the same time and with various files and this thing doesn't even flinch. The first few hours setting up and downloading all the programs it felt a big sluggish and I was starting to get worried. Once that was done, it started to fly.Yes, the rotating screen isnt as flawless as apple's iPad. That said, I bought this not to look pretty, i bought it to be my tool in battle. Being able to run all the programs that a regular PC can run is the main decision I went for Microsoft Surface.  The only downside is that Microsoft is a bit costly on the accessories front.I recommend this piece of tech to anyone who needs to travel or is on the move.  I'm a relatively big guy and i've had no major problem with the size of the keyboard. I do put it FLAT on tables because my keystrokes tend to be pretty hard and the keyboard is the most (in my opinion) fragile of the accessories.Lastly, the Pen interface is not perfect YET but oh man, as a first timer working with it, it kicks total ass and makes note taking in OneNote a complete positive trip.","Microsoft Surface Pro 7 – 12.3"" Touch-Screen - 10th Gen Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory – 1TB SSD – Platinum","$2,300.00"

I'm primarily using it as a writing tablet and e-reader for part-time grad school, and I'd like to start using it for work (engineer). It's improved my workflow a ton. The Surface Pen is great and the magnet makes for a very secure attachment. I considered the Surface Pro X, because it has an option for stowing the slim pen in its keyboard but opted for the regular surface pen after trying them out in a retail store.I've deducted one star because:The large bezel. Doesn't bother me much at all, but it really doesn't stack up to competitor designs in 2019/2020. Still looks very sleek overall.Windows 10 works surprisingly well in tablet mode, but Microsoft is really missing an opportunity by not having a good built-in or Office e-reader (epub, pdf, mobi support) with pen support for document/ebook markup. Edge doesn't cut it feature-wise. Luckily there's a popular app in the Microsoft Store called Drawboard PDF that works really well. The lack of Microsoft application support for critical Surface features is another reason for deducting a star! OneNote and other apps were great on here. I'd love to try an MS designed e-reader with pen support.","Microsoft Surface Pro 7 – 12.3"" Touch-Screen - 10th Gen Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory – 1TB SSD – Platinum","$2,300.00"

The packaging & shipping is well done. The device shipped within the expected time frame.As for the device itself, I found the screen size  of 12.3 inches to be a little bit on the bigger side for a tablet mode but is perfect for laptop use. the screen colors are vibrant and supports touch. Windows Hello lets you sign into your account via face recognition, I find it to be more convenient than writing the password to login. I got the I5 8GB version and the windows 10 experience is very smooth for browsing the web, using Microsoft office and other productivity work. I believe for the average person there is no need to buy a higher specs, I5 can get the job done.Surface pro 7 experience is not complete without the Type cover keyboard and Surface pen. Both are a must if you want get the best out of the device and they are worth their price tags.I want to highlight that though this device is a 2-In-1, it is a significantly better laptop than a tablet.

I dont think I sacrificed anything for portability and size.  only comment I would have is Msoft should shrink the bezel around the screen.  but that's a nit of a thing.  I only gave 4 stars for battery.  it's very good (7 +/- hours under normal use), but as always could be better :).  I dont use if for games so cant comment on that.","Microsoft Surface Pro 7 – 12.3"" Touch-Screen - 10th Gen Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory – 1TB SSD – Platinum","$2,300.00"
28,Alfredo,"December 17, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,i5 10th gen /8gb RAM  / 128GB,"I initially bought a Surface Go(8gb) for a gift and when I had it in my hands I fell in love with the Surface. I had to get one for myself. Since I didn't find another 8gb surface go model, I went w/ the Pro 7 i5/8gb model myself. I am in love with this device. Watching netflix is great,  Illustrator and other drawing software works great w/ the surface pen. Keyboard took a few minutes to get the hang of it and I quite enjoy it, it works well. It is a bit heavy when holding it w/ one hand (this is why I loved the Surface GO version for normal tablet use) but it is quite light overall.Also tested a few games and it actually surprised me a bit tacking into account this is the i5 model. I am able to play Halo Reach just fine, (note that I had to lower the resolution down to 1080p) and it plays good. Minecraft plays really well. I didnt actually get this for gaming ( lol ) but it plays light games just great (of course it gets warm w/ Reach). StardewValley FTW! Currently this is my primary device and it performs extremely well. If you have the extra cash, do go for the i7 model mainly for the 16gb of RAM. OS consumes around 2.5-3GB of ram, so that doesnt leave much left on the 8GB model. I personally did not have an extra 500$ just to get the i7 model.","Microsoft Surface Pro 7 – 12.3"" Touch-Screen - 10th Gen Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory – 1TB SSD – Platinum","$2,300.00"

My other one lasted for FOUR years w/o any issue - then it died... I was sad.  Bought my new one..... ran like a champ and then randomly started shutting down.  Checked with the techs... ""it's your sleep mode setting""  - nope.  ""It's your screen shut down"" - nope.  ""Newest version...""  Installed, and no help.  WHAT is going on Microsoft?!?!  In my business, we need ease of use and no shut downs.  It happens if I'm idle for more than 5 seconds... so I have to constantly have my finger moving on the mouse pad... ridiculous wish they had a fix so I could NOT have to spend a chunk to get something that DOESN'T do this...only Surface Pro 7's supposedly do this...  :( Makes me sad.","Microsoft Surface Pro 7 – 12.3"" Touch-Screen - 10th Gen Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory – 1TB SSD – Platinum","$2,300.00"
31,Tammy,"December 16, 2020",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great but doesn't include pen, keyboard or mouse","I just took my Surface out of the box... was super excited.... but then saddened to only see the screen.  To the seller, don't include pictures of all the ""extras."" I falsely assumed it was all included.  I would have bought a bundle, but didn't see it as an option.  It's not a deal-breaker as this new purchase is a replacement to the Pro 8 I've had for the past 7 years.  I love my Surface and though I probably should have gone with a cheaper model, I honestly have just loved it so much. It's super lightweight, and I can fit it into a large purse. I have lower back issues, so it has been a real help.  As a small business owner, there is nothing I haven't been able to do with this laptop.  I highly recommend, I just don't like the misleading product listing.","Microsoft Surface Pro 7 – 12.3"" Touch-Screen - 10th Gen Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory – 1TB SSD – Platinum","$2,300.00"
32,Nikki,"November 13, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing Microsoft Surface Pro 7,"I've had my Microsoft Surface Pro 7 since April of this year. Like some other customers did. I checked the system info to make sure I received the correct version. I do have Microsoft Surface Pro 7 . My machine arrived new perfect in the box with no damage. The machine has worked amazingly well from day one. I'm quite surprised how fast it is. How well it handles videos and how quickly it searches. The screen is smaller than I needed, so I bought a 24-inch screen and attached it to the Surface Pro. This machine works better than some laptops I've had. I would recommend this machine.","Microsoft Surface Pro 7 – 12.3"" Touch-Screen - 10th Gen Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory – 1TB SSD – Platinum","$2,300.00"
33,Thomas Wilcox,"July 5, 2022",2.0 out of 5 stars,**NOT NEW** SCAM - BUYER BEWARE,"This product is listed as new, IT IS NOT! On the inside of the 'sealed' box, it looked like it was dragged through the dirt after putting on the plastic covering(see photo). There was also debris underneath the protective plastic cover and the photo was taken AFTER I wiped it off. The USB-A port has obvious signs of use(photo), there are clear signs of use where the touch face is seated as well as the charging port. The harder itself has a small ding. This is the most laughable attempt at selling a used product as new.

37,Ewan Grantham,"May 26, 2020",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Tablet that works like a ""real"" PC","The Microsoft Surface line is still the best tablet for folks who need to use full desktop packages on the go. Pricing is similar to the iPad Pro series (once you get the keyboards and stylus for each), but you are getting a full desktop experience here. So less compromises on the applications you may need to run. Latest i7 plus a decently fast SSD makes this a good portable workhorse. Battery life is not ideal, and you will hear the machine spin up when you're running bigger apps, but the portability and light weight is generally worth it. Light gaming is possible with the i7 Iris graphics, and you can do work with both Photoshop and Lightroom without spending too much more time than on your main machine. If your need for a mobile computer is ""Work first"" rather than ""Create first"", then this will be your best bet.","Microsoft Surface Pro 7 – 12.3"" Touch-Screen - 10th Gen Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory – 1TB SSD – Platinum","$2,300.00"
38,Eliseo,"October 10, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Full Blown Windows Machine in Tablet Form,I went with the Surface tablet because I needed all the utility of a Windows machine in tablet form.  You can install any and every Windows designed PC application onto this (as long as the specs of the tablet support the application's min. requirements).  I also bought the keyboard/cover and use a wireless mouse with this to give me the feel and usability of a laptop when needed.
