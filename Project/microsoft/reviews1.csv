0,Silvie,"March 18, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,Worse than the SP4 for art,"I've had a Surface Pro 4 for years now and it has been used for all my personal and commissioned artwork since I got it. Before that, I had a SP3, which was also amazing -- so I'm a big Surface fan in general. Unfortunately, My Pro 4 is finally on its way out. The charging port is iffy, and it does not support Windows 11, meaning in a year or so it would be obsolete anyway. So, with the good sale on the 8s, which has 11 by default, I decided to upgrade.The 8 does have a bigger screen and an upgradable hard drive, which are the nicest features. But for art, it feels like a downgrade to a much cheaper tablet.Firstly, despite Microsoft saying it supports their specific models, none of the old Surface pens actually work fully. I tested OneNote, Paint, Medibang Paint Pro, and Photoshop, just to be sure it wasn't software-based.... but using any of those pens caused CRAZY line wobble on diagonals (see picture; straight line is when I tried using my finger). Drawing vertical or horizontal lines, no problem -- straight as your hand can go. Even using a ruler, attempting to draw any line that veers horizontally (or a circle/any shape that requires diagonal angles) produces a very strange squiggle that renders art impossible. I spent HOURS with Microsoft support, downloading drivers, reinstalling Windows, the whole works -- right up until they told me that it must be a device problem and to return it. So return it I did.... and the second one has the exact same problem. I drove all the way into town to a store that had a display model and tested my multiple pens on that one, and found even the display has that issue. Weird seeing as they even sold the old pens still!So, I tried upgrading to the Slim Pen 2, a nice extra hundred and twenty bucks that I didn't expect to have to spend since my SP4 pens were listed as compatible. But, it works! The pen is nice, too, though I am frustrated that I had to buy it at all. If the computer can't recognize the pens fully, IMO they shouldn't be listed as supported. If I had known that I needed the newest surface pen from the get go, I wouldn't be nearly as annoyed.But then, I found out that not ONLY do you need to use a very specific pen.... but you CAN'T use a screen protector. My SP4 worked with a good tempered glass screen protector on it, absolutely no problem. I went through 3 protectors over the last few years due to them cracking or getting scratched, so I definitely need a protector -- but upon installing any glass protector on the 8, I get the diagonal wobbly line issue AGAIN. For pete's sake. I tested 4 different screen protectors and had the same issue every time. I read reviews for every single brand's screen protector available on Amazon, and each one had a review saying they had touch issues after applying it.Eventually, I found a film-based matte protector that DOES work. It will maybe 1/20 times produce a wobbly line, but is far more consistent and usable. Only problem is that there was literally one option available for a film-based protector on amazon, it was awful to install and has bubbles, and the matte visibility makes it have an awful texture/distorts the picture a bit. Perhaps as the device gets older, more screen protectors will be developed for it that aren't annoying, but for now I feel forced into using it this way and I still find myself using my 4 despite its charging issues.Thus far I'm very disappointed in the 8. As a note-taking device or portable Windows tablet, it's fine,  but for art I'd pick an SP4 over it any day.","Microsoft Surface Pro 8-13"" Touchscreen - Intel¬Æ Evo Platform Core‚Ñ¢ i7-16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Device Only - Platinum (Latest Model)","$1,911.69"
1,Karl Connolly,"August 22, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Loving this version of MS Surface Pro,"I‚Äôve had the surface pro three for many years and use it for DJing with a leading provider of D.J. Software. The requirements of the sulfur however really taxed that version of the surface pro three and so this upgrade to surface pro eight has been like coming out of the dark ages into the light. The system is incredibly responsive, and I‚Äôm absolutely loving the speed at which it processes the application and any of the tasks that I‚Äôve thrown at it. My only issue is that for some reason Microsoft has chosen to replace the SD slot with the capability to replace  the internal drive and I really miss that little drive. Still love the 8 though and would recommend it. Microsoft in windows 11 have done amazing things with respect to ease of set up an configuration and connectivity to the device by a facial recognition etc.","Microsoft Surface Pro 8-13"" Touchscreen - Intel¬Æ Evo Platform Core‚Ñ¢ i7-16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Device Only - Platinum (Latest Model)","$1,911.69"

4,Jerry,"April 9, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Built wonderfully for Windows 11 but rather expensive. Windows Home, no micro-SD slot.","It was time to replace my old surface pro 3 which I bought new several years ago since it became very slow (only 8 GB of ram) and hot while the battery slowed to only 1 hour duration. I was torn between purchasing the Dell XPS 13 (which was about $300 cheaper) or the Surface Pro 8. I chose the Surface since I preferred the tablet functionality while retaining the option of a keyboard which is removeable (sold separately). I find it convenient to sit in my recliner with the tablet to read a book online.I bought the 32GB version of the Surface pro 8 since you cannot upgrade the memory later. Frankly, it is very fast, boots up within seconds, and I really enjoy Windows 11 on it. The touch screen is very responsive, especially with a new pen. Be sure to review and select the gesture controls to avoid erratic movements and find that place in settings to use your pen as a mouse. I use it with as a PC with a keyboard purchased separately and as a tablet when I read my books. It has two USB-C ports on the side (thunderbolt 4) which you could connect through a hub to a monitor (I have not). It connects nicely to my roku wirelessly as I cast the computer screen to the TV when needed to show pictures/videos. The surface pro 3 could not.After spending all of this money I was annoyed to discover it came with Windows Home and not Windows Pro, so I spent more money to upgrade it from the windows store. It does NOT come with a micro-SD card slot which the Surface pro 3 had!  But the hard drive is replaceable which is some benefit. Any further annoyances are due to getting use to Windows 11, which overall I like and will eventually upgrade my other PCs. Overall, I am very happy with this expensive purchase.","Microsoft Surface Pro 8-13"" Touchscreen - Intel¬Æ Evo Platform Core‚Ñ¢ i7-16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Device Only - Platinum (Latest Model)","$1,911.69"

20,John T Taylor,"March 10, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Microsoft Surface Pro8 (genuine),"Some of the reviews concerned me about refurbished models or not Surface Pro 8 devices.  I read the comments after I purchased.  One person noted, not in an original MS box. The Amazon rules, you can return if not opened. If it was in a plain box, or I felt it was not what I ordered then I would have not opened and returned to Amazon.In my case, I received a genuine sealed Microsoft Box with the correct markings. I did receive a Microsoft Surface Pro 8 (ran surface command) reports ""Surface Pro 8 Model 1983 i7"" running Windows 11 Home. Two Thunderbolt ports to the right, all good.In spite of the swelling battery issue (8yr Surface 3, now disposed, and 6yr Surface 4, swapped) I still like the Microsoft Surface Pro.

That being said I need to work in Windows a lot.  I was going to buy a laptop but began to think about the advantages of the tablet form factor.  After weighing the pros-and-cons I went for the Windows Surface Pro 8 because there are no decent Linux tablets available and having tested my wife's iPad I was not interested in one of those.  I also purchased the flip down keyboard/cover which is a must for my use cases.  Long story short I was very pleasantly surprised by the display, performance, battery life, and form-factor with the fold down keyboard.

45,kakin,"February 22, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Power Connector broken,"I returned this laptop because the power connector broke and I could not charge the unit.  If the connector broke within a few months, than a new power cord would not be any better.  I was charge over $200 to ""restock"" the item which I think is not right.  I had a picture, but cannot find it.  I hope I can receive the amount that was deducted to ""restock"".","Microsoft Surface Pro 8-13"" Touchscreen - Intel¬Æ Evo Platform Core‚Ñ¢ i7-16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Device Only - Platinum (Latest Model)","$1,911.69"

48,MOHAMMED  WAHEED,"March 7, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Deceptive product description,"Just got the Surface to take on a family vacation in 2 days (i.e., there's no time to return it & buy a different one) & then it would be my home computer for all my writing, yay...but it turns out that it does NOT come with a keyboard. The description is a lie. If they wanted to be honest, they'd say ""Does not come with keyboard"" instead of ""Accessories not included but let us tell you how amazing this keyboard is & look, here are some photos also of the Surface with a keyboard!""","Microsoft Surface Pro 8-13"" Touchscreen - Intel¬Æ Evo Platform Core‚Ñ¢ i7-16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Device Only - Platinum (Latest Model)","$1,911.69"
