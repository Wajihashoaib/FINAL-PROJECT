16,Kurt K.,"September 14, 2020",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Compact, Quick, User Friendly, Great Display","I am new to Microsoft laptops. My old HP laptop fell onto the floor one too many times and broke apart so I needed a new laptop. I own and operate two small business, one of them is photography. I needed something that would allow me to smoothly import, edit, and export a large volume of photos. I do quite a few emails and invoicing for both businesses so I needed something quick and reliable. I was drawn to this laptop after doing extensive research on a bunch of laptops for about a week. I liked the build of it but also what it was capable of. It's important to have a high quality screen when editing photos and this laptop does not disappoint at all. The screen is beautiful.I'm a big fan of buying refurbished so that did not worry me at all. However this was my first time buying a refurbished laptop, and from Amazon at that. The laptop arrived in mint condition. It was basically brand new. I wouldn't have had a clue it had ever been used before. I've had it for almost a week now and have had no issues. I've sent email, edited photos, video called, and printed photos from it. It runs smoothly and very quickly. I also enjoy the touch screen option. All in all I am very happy with this laptop and I would recommend it. I will update this review if anything should happen.I did dock a star because the lack of CD drive and SD card slot.",Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 Touchscreen Intel i5-1035G7 8GB RAM 128GB SSD Win 10 (Renewed),$435.99
