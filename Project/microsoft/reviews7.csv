1,Eliza G,"May 4, 2020",3.0 out of 5 stars,Too clever by half,"I thought I could live with only 2 USB ports. But I can't. Guys, sometimes less is not more. This is a PITA to get all of my peripherals connected to. My bad. I saw there were only 2 ports. Even with a docking station, this is incredibly annoying.  Even the Surface Pro has more. Sigh.I thought with the extra memory and larger hard drive, it wouldn't run hot, but it often does.Maybe these 2 points are clouding my views. Anyway, having had a total of 3 surface products, all I can say is that this is my least favorite. By far. Not worth the crazy amount of money.","Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 – 15"" Touch-Screen – AMD Ryzen 7 Surface Edition - 16GB Memory - 512GB Solid State Drive – Matte Black","$1,599.00"

4,A Jones,"March 8, 2020",1.0 out of 5 stars,Faulty Laptop - Thin Blue vertical line on screen that cant be removed,"Buying this laptop was a bad mistake. I bought it in Jan and did not open it until late Feb / early march, I now realise that not opening it and checking the computer as soon as I received it was a huge mistake. When I did open it about 4 weeks later I realised it was faulty and now I'm stuck with the laptop as the refund option has disappeared from my Amazon purchase history.Upon turning on the laptop I noticed a thin blue vertical line on the left of the screen. I tried to find a solution on Google only to discover that the likely culprit is a hardware issue either with the display or graphics card. Today I logged into my Amazon account only to realise that the ""return/refund"" button is no longer there, so I am stuck with a new laptop that has a blue line down the screen. I tried to do a screen capture to show the blue line but the line does not appear in the screen capture, so this to me indicates that its the LED itself which is faulty. I have never heard of or seen this before. I decided to take some picture with my phone, here you will see the line, it looks black in the photos but its actually blue.Amazon or seller please help as I need this laptop replaced or refunded.","Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 – 15"" Touch-Screen – AMD Ryzen 7 Surface Edition - 16GB Memory - 512GB Solid State Drive – Matte Black","$1,599.00"

6,Amazon Customer,"January 20, 2020",1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of money,"I just can't believe I wasted $2,000  on this thing.  I waited 4 days before writing this review just to really test the laptop. And the problem that I have with the laptop a lot of other people also have it  (Don't trust the reviews on youtube because they most likely get paid by this trash company). I only used the laptop to watch youtube and some live streams and noticed the fan gets loud for no reason + heating problem + sometimes it lags and you have to restart the browser + brightness is so bad,  no matter how high or low it's It doesn't feel comfortable looking at the screen. There's no point in replacing it because a lot of other people have done it and the same problems occurred. This's the last time I buy anything from Microsoft and i hope they get sued for scamming and selling a defective product!","Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 – 15"" Touch-Screen – AMD Ryzen 7 Surface Edition - 16GB Memory - 512GB Solid State Drive – Matte Black","$1,599.00"
