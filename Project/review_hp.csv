0,0,Catherine,"July 9, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,"A decent, inexpensive laptop. Good for what I do.","I'm a writer and student and use non-MS programs so I could not get a Chromebook. I also needed a laptop so I had a way to write or research when I was travelling. I have a large desktop ""work"" computer where most of my work is done. I had a similar HP laptop but the keyboard and touch pad went out and I expect that those two things are the weakest link in any laptop. Buy a silicon key cover to make the life of your keyboard last, but these laptops, on average last abut 2-3 years. Another thing that will make the computer last longer is to get a USB mouse to avoid using the track pad.About the only difference between the new and the old HPs was that this had 4G of RAM and the other had 8G of RAM. This Stream is definitely good at not seizing or lurching when you watch a movie or video. The other additive that Microsoft has put on this computer is the ""Windows 10-S."" It is easy to get out of, and there is a toggle to change the program to ""Windows 11 Home,"" which is more capable of evading corporate MS's iron handed ownership of my computer. The instructions are online and they send a large postcard with the computer which also has instructions. It is just a  matter of going into ""settings"" and changing it.I do not mind the PC and MS ""marriage"" but I do not want a computer that tells me I can only use their programs which happened with Chromebook. This one is constantly asking (begging) me to turn on my Cloud service, and turn on other MS Programs. I do not do any of that, and I do not want to send my work to the cloud (When I import it into the big machine I will). I like that it has an extra USB port. Otherwise it is pretty basic and reminds me of  Chromebook, (which I like but cannot use because of the non-MS proprietary writing programs I use).As far as using it for entertainment or videos, the sound is nice and loud (but not blasting) the picture is great, and it does not buffer endlessly-- but that may be my internet service.My overall opinion is ""nice.""  It is a good computer for Students or Writers who do not want or need to spend $1000 on top of the line equipment. Nope. this is just a ""tuck it in the bag and go"" type computer.","Newest HP 14"" HD Laptop, Windows 11, Intel Celeron Dual-Core Processor Up to 2.60GHz, 4GB RAM, 64GB SSD, Webcam, Dale Pink(Renewed) (Dale Pink)",$212.99,reviews1.csv

Because I'm not a gamer nor run a home business I don't need a lighting speed or mega space (frankly the average person doesn't either). So I've had my HP laptops for literally 5-8 years before I'm forced to replace them solely due to OUTSIDE programs like windows requiring more and more space.. All I can say about windows is UGH! Constantly battle to clean off 'garbage' apps and their effort to control the world. HP has monitors that are very clear and easy on the eye strain. I don't use cheaters with HP monitors. Those provided by corporations affect your vision. After hours on these my eyes have trouble focusing on TV screen. As time goes on cheaters become necessary to clearly read normal print or images. (Sometimes I replace the 'free' work monitors with my own HP. It's worth saving my vision. Proof of this - I'm over 70 and have great vision - only use +1.00 cheaters for reading menu's in dark restaurants or the tabs they print out when their ink should have been replaced some time ago.,"2020 HP 15 15.6"" HD Touchscreen Premium Laptop - 10th Gen Intel Core i5-1035G1, 16GB DDR4, 512GB SSD, USB Type-C, HDMI, Windows 10 - Silver W",$799.00,reviews10.csv

The screen quality is excellent and the I/O has everything that we need to connect the camera, monitor and printer.

This has to be the best ""bang for the buck"" machine that I have ever purchased.  The 10th gen 1035G1 i5 is obscenely fast when mixed with the 16gb ddr4 and the 1/2 TB NVMe sdd.  This is elegant as anything as well.  A beautiful chassis.  I was surprised by how light it is.  I guess that is to be expected since I think everything except for the cpu fan is solid state.  The onboard camera is very clear and a driver license text is legible for secure websites.  The CPU includes neural net instructions from the Xeon line for the first time for consumer in the 10th gen chips.  If you are doing data science with development suites like Anaconda using Jupyter notebooks or working with Netbeans or using a MySQL instance for learning this is blazing fast for a great price.In a nutshell, this offers Windows workstation performance with Chromebook simplicity/pricing.*update* (2/2/21)Well I bought this on Dec 16th 19', so I figured an update was in order.  Power on hours read as 2970 according to HWinfo64 and it is still running strong and I have certainly  put it through its paces  Some might say that the UHD G1 graphics are a bit anemic but I think that it's fine for the 1366x768p screen.  Triple A games most likely will be very slow but classic titles like Portal 2 can be played ""maxed out""The Intel 660p QLC drive is also really good i think for the price.

I know it is not the fastest solution out there but on my Asus AC1300 router I get 325mbps from a different floor of the house the hypotenuse length being about 20-25 through a floor and a wall.

6,6,Danny Nguyen,"January 18, 2020",5.0 out of 5 stars,"2020 HP 15 15.6"" HD Touchscreen Premium Laptop","Key Points:- A cheap deal for a competitive performance laptop- Thin & Lightweight (Easy to carry)- Large storage space for basically any consumer need- Comes with HP Customer Service application on set-up (1-year warranty)Experience:If you're like me, you hate to buy something without the full confidence in the product first. Believe me, it's difficult sometimes to buy things online due to the limitation of only being able to rely on other customer's reviews before the product is purchased and arrives at your doorstep. However, I have a pretty positive outlook on this laptop for its price. I attached a few photos to showcase its exterior mechanisms, as well as showcase a general size of what laptop to expect in real-world size (as opposed to reading numbers and expecting to visualize that in your head). The laptop is about 23cm length by 35-36cm width with a thickness of 1.5 cm. The weight is as advertised, it's comfortable to carry around and will fit in thin spaces; it won't occupy too much room in a backpack or luggage. For its technical aspects, I used a free CPU test online called UserBenchmark to compare its performance to other users who also documented their computers/laptops. (This provides a bias as it only takes into account for users who test their computers on that specific software, but it's still a good comparison to get a general idea of the performance the laptop provides.) Attached also is the report containing simplified and relevant data to its specifications. Its computing power is where this computer shines the most, as it performs in the top 75%+ percentile, which is what most consumers will desire, as GPU is of less importance in that they don't intend to purchase a cheaper laptop with the intentions to play heavier & more demanding video games on it. I was actually pleasantly surprised to hear of a lower pricing laptop that came with 16GB of RAM, which is almost unheard of for this price range, and although I didn't document how much free space was available upon receiving and setting it up, there is still ~400+ GB available after transferring the bulk of my applications and user data from my old laptop. For the price it's set at, I personally think it's a great deal since its competitors will often price the same specifications for almost twice the price. As a side note, HP doesn't load the computer with so many useless applications as Lenovo does that the consumer will more than likely never use... (occupying memory). Overall, very happy & satisfied with my purchase, I would thoroughly recommend it, and I look forward to programming code with this laptop.","2020 HP 15 15.6"" HD Touchscreen Premium Laptop - 10th Gen Intel Core i5-1035G1, 16GB DDR4, 512GB SSD, USB Type-C, HDMI, Windows 10 - Silver W",$799.00,reviews10.csv
7,7,A guy,"August 29, 2020",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great laptop, good value","Background: I bought this six months ago, weeks before the pandemic. I have been using it 10-12h every day, mainly for work (PhD in biochemistry). I installed Kubuntu on the first day and seldom boot on Windows. Main software I use is Firefox, PyCharmm, Zoom, and office stuff. I do not play games.Overall, it is a great computer. The CPU is quite fast, the NVME SSD is excellent, and 16 Gb is more than enough RAM for my needs. The i5-1035G1 has 4 core/8 threads, and my experience with it is great. I don't recall a single slow down, and some times I even run small 5-10 min jobs. I cannot comment on the GPU, as I don't play games.The usable screen to overall size rate is good, as there is only a small strip of plastic around it, so the laptop it is not that large, as some 15.6"" models. It feels light and thin. But the screen is a bit dim, and not HD. The keyboard is responsive and there is a numpad, which some may seem as useless, but is a pro by me. The touch pad is ok, but I sometimes wish it to be larger.What I dislike most about the laptop is the thermal design. The cooler is noisy and it runs too often. It's annoying. For some reason, the hot air is blown towards the screen, and I think it makes the noise even more obvious. For some reason, I think the fan was even louder on Windows, so be aware! There are some other annoyances (see below).All in all, it's an excellent laptop for the price tag, if you are not playing games or do not need a good GPU for any reason.Pros: - CPU/RAM/SSD combo, ie, great speed - Touchscreen - Good keyboard - Battery lasts for 3h-4h - Light and thinCons - Noisy fan - Screen is a bit dim, and it is not HD (res is 1366x768) - Keyboard is not backlit","2020 HP 15 15.6"" HD Touchscreen Premium Laptop - 10th Gen Intel Core i5-1035G1, 16GB DDR4, 512GB SSD, USB Type-C, HDMI, Windows 10 - Silver W",$799.00,reviews10.csv

Moreover , I love the design of screen , almost minimum bezel and it gives a premium look. Keyboard keys are smooth.I sometimes face a little issues with touchpad sometimes it stuck or hangs maybe i can call it less sensitive that isn't a big issue to worry also the touchscreen works really fine , no worries at all. There are no lights under keyboard pads,so it makes it difficult to type in dark.PERFORMANCE- This laptop starts pretty fast in almost under 20 secs, it will boot up and take you to desktop. I played Asphalt 9 on this laptop on the very first day and it played smoothly  , and you can play other games also but problem will be that it will be in low quality due to less resolution of screen otherwise processor has no problem in running games (for more information you can search for processor details on google according to your priorities).I would not recommend for gaming purposes.THINGS TO NOTE- Since this product is available from third party you won’t be getting 12 months warranty cause they upgrade the laptop and then deliver further, in my case i got 9 months of warranty.Laptop is quite slim and gives a quite unique look. No problem with wifi and battery (4-5hrs on screen battery backup). This was all i knew , To sum up product requires smooth handling due to plastic build , system never hanged for me although i tried to overload it .So if you are looking for light usage and minimal gaming its great also touchscreen is a great feature. .I have attached few screenshots of the device full name and general specs","2020 HP 15 15.6"" HD Touchscreen Premium Laptop - 10th Gen Intel Core i5-1035G1, 16GB DDR4, 512GB SSD, USB Type-C, HDMI, Windows 10 - Silver W",$799.00,reviews10.csv

It starts almost immediately, in seconds.  It's not overloaded with useless apps, so not much to remove.  There is McAfee antivirus but it's not activated.  So in 1 month I'm not going to get annoying pop - ups asking me to pay for it.It's the first time I've had touch screen.  I didn't think I needed it, and probably wouldn't except that I am not teaching a graphic design class and the touch screen is very helpful.  Instead of using the mouse pad to draw I can use the screen, which is more accurate.  I wish the screen laid flat for tablet mode so that I could draw more easily.  but, hey, I didn't know I needed it and HP would most likely charge more for that.Only one complaint.  The construction wasn't well thought out.  The keyboard sits in a tray so there is a bezel around it.  It is constantly scratching at my wrists as I type.

Still hating the construction of the computer.  It's cheaply built but I'm ok with that because the inside is awesome.  I also found that the mic seems to be directional.  Doing a lot of virtual now and I find if I'm not directly in front of the computer, people say they can't hear me.  I think it needs an external mic.  The screen quality can be better.

I can make due and the picture quality is fine, but over time, it gets annoying to be able to see such a small amount of content on the screen. Web pages often don't display properly.-It doesn't work for Zoom meetings. I have 100 Mbps speed, but get notifications when on Zoom meetings that my connection is unstable. I never get these notifications when zooming on the same network from my iPad or iPhone.-I just don't have any use for a touch screen laptop. All it does is make it a lot easier for my cat to derail my work activity. The touch screen works very well, if that's something you're wanting.-There are much cheaper Acer computers that seem to run much closer to the advertised CPU, have 1920x1080 resolution, and a backlit keyboard.Save yourself some money and frustration and buy an Acer.

Hardly noticeable, although overall it looked brand new. I have no real complaints as of yet while using it. It's what I expected, I knew it is not a computer meant for gaming but more for getting some work done. I can easily open 12 tabs, have a youtube vid running and open a word document but it is not going to run Minecraft on the lowest settings, I mean it can but its unplayable in my opinion.The computer does not come with windows 11 installed, I felt lied too when I got it and saw it running windows 10 In S mode out of the box since the description, title and specs clearly say and show windows 11. (running ""S mode"" just means running safe mode) It comes with a card in the box telling you how to disable it, but one disabled it can not be re-enabled. The photos even show windows 11. But not to worry, I simply installed windows 11 on my own after a days worth of updates. A quick google search and one youtube vid can help install it.It does not have an ethernet port. But I got an ethernet to USB adaptor to make pages load faster.The camera? It has one! It works, it will get the job done.No issues with any ports or the charging cable, no issues with the mouse pad. Everything feels brand new.In conclusion, this is a decent laptop at its price for getting work done. So if you need a computer to write an essay for school or need to hop in a zoom call then this can work just as good as your phone. Personally I plan to learn and practice learning some programming languages on it from youtube and such.

So for the next 2-3 years, every time I want to boot this laptop and use it, I'll be typing in passwords and/or PIN's.  Absolutely NO WHERE is this mentioned in all of HP's literature.

Ever.  This is my 3rd HP laptop and I am shocked that they did this...  A usable cam would not have cost them $5 more.  And then to not be up front about this and kind of ""hide"" this huge shortcoming is disappointing to say the least.  Would Not recommend if this is a feature you plan on using.

Well, I called Amazon and they got HP Support in on a 3-way call. HP used the HP Support Assistant app on the laptop to diagnose and temp-fix the issue, once I was on wifi,  they remotely updated all drivers associated with the wifi issue, and the laptop in general, for a permanent wifi fix, this, all via the wifi connection; and, they are waiting for my update to ensure that the issue is resolved permanently, so for now, I am impressed with the HP laptop and the HP support. I just wish I didnt have a need for the support in the first place. Also, after watching what the tech did remotely, a knowledgeable  person who is AWARE of the HP Support Assistant app could troubleshoot and fix the wifi issue themselves as long as they then also go to the HP site and update the laptop wifi and any other recommended out of date drivers; But again, we shouldnt have to do that... last note, I also have a 3 year old HP Envy laptop that I can now hand off to a family member, it has been bulletproof since day one.

27,27,Karsten T. Brown,"February 8, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent For The Price,"When judging this laptop, always keep the price in mind.First, the cons:Is it a gaming computer? No; the graphics adapter isn't intended for that purpose. Is the housing suitable for those (e.g., children) who toss around electronics without regard for their durability? No; it is cheap plastic. Don't buy it if you expect to use it for those purposes. The matte screen isn't the brightest. The sound quality isn't immersive. There is no optical drive.Now, the pros:The price. This is a 15"" laptop with Windows 11. Even though the laptop isn't for gaming, I have used Adobe cs6 software with no issues— Premiere Pro, Photoshop, Audition. Rendering video isn't super speedy, but it isn't unreasonable. I was extremely doubtful it could run those programs, and didn't buy it for that purpose, as I have another computer for it, but it was definitely a great and welcome surprise.Who should buy this laptop? Anyone who wants a light-weight computer for school, travel, or home, on which they can use email, stream video, take notes, browse the internet, or even edit photos and short videos in Photoshop and Premiere Pro.[As a sidenote, I suspect this laptop would have no issues with the beautiful and ubiquitous memory hog, Google Chrome, but I have not installed it. If you do a lot of browsing— and who doesn't?— then I would suggest looking at other browsers, such as Vivaldi. I offer that advise no matter which computer you might be using, so it is not specific to this laptop.]","HP 15.6-inch Laptop, 11th Generation Intel Core i5-1135G7, Intel Iris Xe Graphics, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, Windows 11 Home (15-dy2024nr, Natural silver)",$519.00,reviews5.csv

38,38,Chubb,"May 24, 2022",1.0 out of 5 stars,The laptop arrived with a crack case,"We bought this computer to replace one that was ""irredeemable"". It has an i5 Intel processor which appears to be ten times faster than the i3.  I am not sure why the speed has increased, but we like it a whole lot better.  The only way we could make the old one useable was to leave it on 24 hours a day.  This computer closes down when we shut the lid and starts up when we lift it.  The only reason we bought this computer was to have a computer that is only used for financial matters----we do not search the web or receive e-mails.  The main reason we bought this laptop from Amazon was the 4 year extended warranty, which, I was told, included tech support.  We had a lot of problems with the last laptop, and needed tech support which was only good for one year.  (By the way, it is interesting that we enjoyed the last computer until one day Microsoft ""updated"" my windows 10 and then the computer stopped working.  I contacted Microsoft and told them how the computer worked fine until they ""updated"" my computer, and asked if they would fix it.  They said they would be glad to fix it for a $99 charge.  At that point I was loud and angry.  I explained that I felt that this was ransom ware.  ""You screwed up my computer and for $99 you will fix it"".  I said I would not pay such ransom ware money.  I would throw my computer away first and buy a new one.  I contacted Acer tech support and they said they would fix it for nothing.  They did, and when asked how I could keep this from happening again they said just unclick the ""automatic update button"".  I did just that and for 4 years I loved my computer again.)  An update to my review:  the laptop arrived with a crack on the face just to the left of the top left speaker.  I returned the computer to the supplier and they gave me credit for it minus $77.70 for a restocking charge.  No doubt they are restocking the computer so they can sell it to you and pull the same scam on you.-----------A further update on my refund----------The seller (Tech Deals Store) is refusing to refund all my money since I opened the box and started using it before I discovered the crack.  I have asked for a full refund, and am awaiting their answer.  If I don't receive my money then I will contact Amazon and ask them for the remainder off my refund.  If that doesn't work then I will file a dispute with my credit card company.  ( I am not letting Tech Deals Store get by with this scam.)  Further update---- Amazon gave me the $77.70 back.  I hope I remember the name ""Tech Deals Store"" and never buy from these people again.","HP 15.6-inch Laptop, 11th Generation Intel Core i5-1135G7, Intel Iris Xe Graphics, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, Windows 11 Home (15-dy2024nr, Natural silver)",$519.00,reviews5.csv

Was a little hesitant about Windows 11 but it turns out pretty similar to 10 (hey - it took me a few years to evolve from DOS to Windows...). It's not touch screen, but that's okay b/c I'm not used to touch screen. It has a separate number pad - bit plus to me entering a lot of numbers. Enough USB ports, etc. and even a USB-C. I like it. It has an SSD which is GREAT. I replaced my desktop HDD with SDD and the time to boot went from about 4 minutes and 40 seconds to about 40 seconds...bit plus there!

The only things I can say for it are that it's lightweight and the battery life seems to be good.I blame myself for not noticing that this machine does not have a touch screen.

Any movement of anyone or anything during a video causes some kind of green splotches to flash on and off all over the screen.I guess I got spoiled with the Samsung, but I learned from this experience not to buy a low-end chromebook. I have returned this already, and after some research (which I should have done in the first place) I went to Lenovo's website and bought a C13 Yoga Thinkpad chromebook, on sale for $349.
