2,Amaze-O-Tron,"April 26, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Best laptop you can buy for the money but...,"I love this laptop, after reading reviews and shopping around for a few weeks I decided the Lenovo Flex 5 was going to give me the most bang for my buck.You won't find a better performing Ultrabook in the $800 range.Equipped with an AMD 4700U 2ghz boosting to 4.1ghz 8 core 8 thread processor and 16gb of 3200mhz ram, this thing is a beast.It'll play just about any game you throw at it at 60+fpsOn top of that you get a solid keyboard, Lenovo's trusted FN+Q 3 mode Silent, Battery Saver, and Turbo hotkey functions.A rigid frame, a great trackpad, a fingerprint reader, 720p webcam with privacy lens, and great sounding speakers considering they're cased inside of a 14 inch Ultrabook.While I do love this laptop I will admit that it's not perfect.The battery life, while advertised at 10 hours, on this model works out to around 7 - 7.5 hours of moderate use. The models with the 4500u possessors should get closer to 8-9 hour battery life however I've only tested the 4700U model.The second caveat is the screen, a 1080p 60hz Touchscreen IPS, while for what it is this screen looks very nice and is very responsive to the touch, It doesn't get incredibly bright and while it does support HDR playback the screen itself is not HDR and only reaches a brightness of around 250 nits.Another thing worth mentioning is the built in wireless card is wifi 5, however it is swappable, wifi 6e cards are only around $40 so I'd recommend swapping that out if you do decide to purchase this laptop, you mite also want to pick up the optional charger, the one that comes with the laptop uses its only USBC port, while the optional charger plugs into a charger port.Also there is only one M.2 slot so if you want more memory you'll want to clone and swap the hard drive.All in all I think this is a great laptop and I'm looking forward to using is for many years to come.","Lenovo Flex 5 14"" Full HD 2-in-1 Touchscreen Laptop, AMD Ryzen 7 5700U, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Windows 11 Home",&729
3,unidave199,"November 1, 2020",4.0 out of 5 stars,Believe the hype!,"You can see so many YouTube videos saying what a hot deal this is... and it IS!I am generally using this as an office adjunct, some light video processing, and some home utility funciton.I do not have the Lenovo pen or any other active pen so I can't speak to that.  But what I can see is that it is well built, solid feeling, and quality functions.  I can utilize the installed Microsoft Suite and OneDrive sync quite nicely and was able to buy a 2nd pin style power supply so I do not need to depend on the USBC port to charge this device.  I recommend it also because it is a single 'wall wart' and not a 2 piece brick style supply so makes travel a bit easier for me.The track pad works fine for me (after a little adjustment) and the battery can pull me through a couple of days of light office work.  The screen is just fine indoors and the touch function works great.I tiny wish is that it had a USB port on each side... but that is a minor nit pic... not a deal breaker. I am glad for the HDMI full size output for work and display functions.The screen swivels back all the way into tablet mode and woks great.  A small note though of tablet mode.  This does have a fan so will make some noise under load.  AND it is a little bit heavy to use one handed as a note taking clipboard. It is fine for short notes or lists but I would not want to carry it all day in tablet mode taking notes.I did have 2 'glitches' .  The closing of the lid should power this unit down.. but I find that sometimes, when I open it up later, the cursor doesn't appear back and I have to reboot it.  And the track pad.. if you touch the very sides, it will not move the cursor.  I am not sure if this is a feature or bug..  But I feel software updates should fix this.","Lenovo Flex 5 14"" Full HD 2-in-1 Touchscreen Laptop, AMD Ryzen 7 5700U, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Windows 11 Home",&729
4,Sean D.,"April 21, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for my needs.,"A lot of what computer you get depends on your needs.  I didn't expect to like this computer as much as I do.  It meets all my needs and overall I am very happy with my purchase 1.5 months later.The Ryzen processor is great.  Everything is very snappy and quick which makes it enjoyable to use.  Pretty decent battery life for normal usage at around 7 hrs.  I really like the touch screen.  It is enjoyable to use.My only con if I had to write one would be, it doesn't have that premium 'feel'.  As in the it uses this hard plastic for most of the material.  No finished metal as you would expect on the premium high priced products.  But I knew I didn't care about that.  For value of your dollar, I don't think you can beat this.I needed something that was good for the following:1. Taking Notes2. Decent Display3.  Decent Battery Performance4.  Browsing the web.5.  Light activities such as word docs, excel, etc.6.  No gaming though I think this would be able to handle light gaming.This laptop is great and I would definitely buy it again or recommend it to a friend. For the price, it is one of the best you can buy right now.  Do your research and I think you find others agree.Cheers,Sean__MD","Lenovo Flex 5 14"" Full HD 2-in-1 Touchscreen Laptop, AMD Ryzen 7 5700U, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Windows 11 Home",&729

6,Bryce,"November 18, 2020",4.0 out of 5 stars,High tier components in a low tier chasis,"It was a shame I didn't end up going with this laptop. The keyboard is just too sub-par compared to lenovo's own thinkpad lineup. The spec on this machine is insane, it rivals my main desktop computer which was top-tier for it's time only 3 years ago.But the fact AMD is not seriously considered by manufacturers (yet) means that the few options to get this god-tier CPU are in trash-tier chasis like this one. It's not overly cheap, but it's definitely not $900 worthy. The keyboard is just too unpleasant to type on for me. Maybe for most it will be fine, but if I kept this thing it would be docked 24/7, and then what's the point of a 2in1 at that point?It was close, but I ended up going with the L13 thinkpad just because of it's far superior chasis and keyboard.","Lenovo Flex 5 14"" Full HD 2-in-1 Touchscreen Laptop, AMD Ryzen 7 5700U, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Windows 11 Home",&729
7,Eric Dozier,"November 29, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,A great replacement for the older 15.6 inch Dell.,"It has proven to be exactly what I needed as a replacement to my 5 year old Dell Inspiron. The 8 - core processor with 16GB of DDR4 RAM is amazingly fast, the 512GB SSD is more than adequate, lastly the 1080p screen is a massive upgrade as is the Wi-Fi (I also added a mesh system to my home). There have been complaints about the brightness (250 nits) though, the only way you'd get a brighter screen is to spend a lot more money. I thought I'd miss having an optical drive, but I haven't noticed its absence.","Lenovo Flex 5 14"" Full HD 2-in-1 Touchscreen Laptop, AMD Ryzen 7 5700U, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Windows 11 Home",&729
8,youlie p.,"November 13, 2021",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Careful with the garanty , just one month , not good seller .the pc has different problems","The pc is good, the problem is the warranty. This review will talk about the properties of the computer vs price. But I will also talk about the risk if you buy with this seller. (It is not amazon or lenovo)This computer  has good price with this seller, the best I found, but it is because it does not cover any warranty after a month. The first month is cover by Amazon. After that Lenovo does not respond because it is not Lenovo the seller Amazon will not do it after the month and the seller will not answer your message. The computer is excellent for its excellent memory speed properties, not too heavy, the screen is not good outdoors, only closed spaces with no intense light, or they will not be able to see much and that is uncofortable. in my case the pc began to have a small sound that did not stop the computer, but it sounded like it was stopping when I opened more than two windows I waited for a month and 15 days, and it was a fatal error, I'm not sure if it's true of that this computer is new (when I validate the ID of the pc with Lenovo they doubted that it was new) careful. The first failure you have if you will buy it, no matter how small, send it to Amazon before the month. Whatever happens next is your responsibility.  As costumer, you are for your own, after this month they will be abandoned. If you are not unlucky like me, the computer will be in good condition, and it is a very good computer compared to the price, but I would advise more to buy the yoga 6. That is now in Best Buy for almost the same price or less and has a better guarantee of damage and weighs less. If you find other seller and good price, I suggest this one. The tactic screen works fine. This computer is great, because what it has, the problem is the seller who is not Amazon or Lenovo is an external person who does not respond.I always check the reviews I did with this one,I took the risk, and sadly I did not check the warranty.","Lenovo Flex 5 14"" Full HD 2-in-1 Touchscreen Laptop, AMD Ryzen 7 5700U, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Windows 11 Home",&729

Also the screen has a yellow tint if I compare it to my old HP Envy 360X, but this you will use to with time.Everything else is excellent for me.","Lenovo Flex 5 14"" Full HD 2-in-1 Touchscreen Laptop, AMD Ryzen 7 5700U, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Windows 11 Home",&729

The models with the 4500u possessors should get closer to 8-9 hour battery life however I've only tested the 4700U model.The second caveat is the screen, a 1080p 60hz Touchscreen IPS, while for what it is this screen looks very nice and is very responsive to the touch, It doesn't get incredibly bright and while it does support HDR playback the screen itself is not HDR and only reaches a brightness of around 250 nits.Another thing worth mentioning is the built in wireless card is wifi 5, however it is swappable, wifi 6e cards are only around $40 so I'd recommend swapping that out if you do decide to purchase this laptop, you mite also want to pick up the optional charger, the one that comes with the laptop uses its only USBC port, while the optional charger plugs into a charger port.Also there is only one M.2 slot so if you want more memory you'll want to clone and swap the hard drive.All in all I think this is a great laptop and I'm looking forward to using is for many years to come.","Lenovo Flex 5 14"" Full HD 2-in-1 Touchscreen Laptop, AMD Ryzen 7 5700U, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Windows 11 Home",&729
43,unidave199,"November 1, 2020",4.0 out of 5 stars,Believe the hype!,"You can see so many YouTube videos saying what a hot deal this is... and it IS!I am generally using this as an office adjunct, some light video processing, and some home utility funciton.I do not have the Lenovo pen or any other active pen so I can't speak to that.  But what I can see is that it is well built, solid feeling, and quality functions.  I can utilize the installed Microsoft Suite and OneDrive sync quite nicely and was able to buy a 2nd pin style power supply so I do not need to depend on the USBC port to charge this device.  I recommend it also because it is a single 'wall wart' and not a 2 piece brick style supply so makes travel a bit easier for me.The track pad works fine for me (after a little adjustment) and the battery can pull me through a couple of days of light office work.  The screen is just fine indoors and the touch function works great.I tiny wish is that it had a USB port on each side... but that is a minor nit pic... not a deal breaker. I am glad for the HDMI full size output for work and display functions.The screen swivels back all the way into tablet mode and woks great.  A small note though of tablet mode.  This does have a fan so will make some noise under load.  AND it is a little bit heavy to use one handed as a note taking clipboard. It is fine for short notes or lists but I would not want to carry it all day in tablet mode taking notes.I did have 2 'glitches' .  The closing of the lid should power this unit down.. but I find that sometimes, when I open it up later, the cursor doesn't appear back and I have to reboot it.  And the track pad.. if you touch the very sides, it will not move the cursor.  I am not sure if this is a feature or bug..  But I feel software updates should fix this.","Lenovo Flex 5 14"" Full HD 2-in-1 Touchscreen Laptop, AMD Ryzen 7 5700U, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Windows 11 Home",&729
44,Sean D.,"April 21, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for my needs.,"A lot of what computer you get depends on your needs.  I didn't expect to like this computer as much as I do.  It meets all my needs and overall I am very happy with my purchase 1.5 months later.The Ryzen processor is great.  Everything is very snappy and quick which makes it enjoyable to use.  Pretty decent battery life for normal usage at around 7 hrs.  I really like the touch screen.  It is enjoyable to use.My only con if I had to write one would be, it doesn't have that premium 'feel'.  As in the it uses this hard plastic for most of the material.  No finished metal as you would expect on the premium high priced products.  But I knew I didn't care about that.  For value of your dollar, I don't think you can beat this.I needed something that was good for the following:1. Taking Notes2. Decent Display3.  Decent Battery Performance4.  Browsing the web.5.  Light activities such as word docs, excel, etc.6.  No gaming though I think this would be able to handle light gaming.This laptop is great and I would definitely buy it again or recommend it to a friend. For the price, it is one of the best you can buy right now.  Do your research and I think you find others agree.Cheers,Sean__MD","Lenovo Flex 5 14"" Full HD 2-in-1 Touchscreen Laptop, AMD Ryzen 7 5700U, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Windows 11 Home",&729

46,Bryce,"November 18, 2020",4.0 out of 5 stars,High tier components in a low tier chasis,"It was a shame I didn't end up going with this laptop. The keyboard is just too sub-par compared to lenovo's own thinkpad lineup. The spec on this machine is insane, it rivals my main desktop computer which was top-tier for it's time only 3 years ago.But the fact AMD is not seriously considered by manufacturers (yet) means that the few options to get this god-tier CPU are in trash-tier chasis like this one. It's not overly cheap, but it's definitely not $900 worthy. The keyboard is just too unpleasant to type on for me. Maybe for most it will be fine, but if I kept this thing it would be docked 24/7, and then what's the point of a 2in1 at that point?It was close, but I ended up going with the L13 thinkpad just because of it's far superior chasis and keyboard.","Lenovo Flex 5 14"" Full HD 2-in-1 Touchscreen Laptop, AMD Ryzen 7 5700U, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Windows 11 Home",&729
47,Eric Dozier,"November 29, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,A great replacement for the older 15.6 inch Dell.,"It has proven to be exactly what I needed as a replacement to my 5 year old Dell Inspiron. The 8 - core processor with 16GB of DDR4 RAM is amazingly fast, the 512GB SSD is more than adequate, lastly the 1080p screen is a massive upgrade as is the Wi-Fi (I also added a mesh system to my home). There have been complaints about the brightness (250 nits) though, the only way you'd get a brighter screen is to spend a lot more money. I thought I'd miss having an optical drive, but I haven't noticed its absence.","Lenovo Flex 5 14"" Full HD 2-in-1 Touchscreen Laptop, AMD Ryzen 7 5700U, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Windows 11 Home",&729
48,youlie p.,"November 13, 2021",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Careful with the garanty , just one month , not good seller .the pc has different problems","The pc is good, the problem is the warranty. This review will talk about the properties of the computer vs price. But I will also talk about the risk if you buy with this seller. (It is not amazon or lenovo)This computer  has good price with this seller, the best I found, but it is because it does not cover any warranty after a month. The first month is cover by Amazon. After that Lenovo does not respond because it is not Lenovo the seller Amazon will not do it after the month and the seller will not answer your message. The computer is excellent for its excellent memory speed properties, not too heavy, the screen is not good outdoors, only closed spaces with no intense light, or they will not be able to see much and that is uncofortable. in my case the pc began to have a small sound that did not stop the computer, but it sounded like it was stopping when I opened more than two windows I waited for a month and 15 days, and it was a fatal error, I'm not sure if it's true of that this computer is new (when I validate the ID of the pc with Lenovo they doubted that it was new) careful. The first failure you have if you will buy it, no matter how small, send it to Amazon before the month. Whatever happens next is your responsibility.  As costumer, you are for your own, after this month they will be abandoned. If you are not unlucky like me, the computer will be in good condition, and it is a very good computer compared to the price, but I would advise more to buy the yoga 6. That is now in Best Buy for almost the same price or less and has a better guarantee of damage and weighs less. If you find other seller and good price, I suggest this one. The tactic screen works fine. This computer is great, because what it has, the problem is the seller who is not Amazon or Lenovo is an external person who does not respond.I always check the reviews I did with this one,I took the risk, and sadly I did not check the warranty.","Lenovo Flex 5 14"" Full HD 2-in-1 Touchscreen Laptop, AMD Ryzen 7 5700U, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Windows 11 Home",&729
