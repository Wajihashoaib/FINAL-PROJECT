0,LC A,"August 15, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Super√≥ mis expectativas,"Hab√≠a tenido hasta el momento varias experiencias con Tablets android para realizar labores de computador en mi trabajo o mientras estaba de viaje, para no llevar mi laptop principal que es m√°s grande y pesada. En general hab√≠a tenido tanto experiencias buenas como malas, pero nunca hab√≠an llegado a compararse con la experiencia de un computador completo, en especial en cuanto a multitasking.Mi √∫ltima tablet android ya necesitaba un cambio as√≠ que mi objetivo era buscar un computador o tablet 2 en 1 para usar como dispositivo secundario a mi laptop principal. Las tablets Android, como ya he dicho, no son las mejores respecto a la funci√≥n multitareas, sus navegadores a veces corren las p√°ginas en su modo m√≥vil; y las laptops o tablets Windows que quer√≠a estaban fuera de mi presupuesto o tenian procesadores que no alcanzaban a correr el sistema operativo de manera r√°pida. As√≠ que le quise dar una oportunidad a Chrome OS con la Lenovo C340, un sistema que nunca hab√≠a usado pero que parec√≠a tener muchas ventajas.Un mes despu√©s de uso estoy sumamente contento con esta tablet. Es muy liviana, con un tama√±o perfecto para uso c√≥modo sin comprometer tama√±o. Su navegador Chrome es la misma versi√≥n que una de computador, lo cual permite cosas desde navegaci√≥n usual hasta edici√≥n de Office via google Docs. Es compatible con casi todas las apps de Android al ser compatible con play store pero permite usar varias ventanas a la vez, y su procesador Celeron N4000, que es algo lento para un S.O. m√°s pesado como Windows, es perfecto y √°gil para Chrome OS. La bater√≠a es incre√≠ble y puede durarme un d√≠a entero en el trabajo, Especialmente usando √∫nicamente Chrome, ya que consume m√°s bater√≠as usando Apps de Android o Apps de Linux. ¬°Y s√≠, tiene soporte para apps de Linux tambi√©n!Tiene soporte para dos puertos USB C, ambos compatibles para poner un adaptador de USB C a HDMI (No tiene puerto HDMI nativo, pero ya ten√≠a el adaptador, por lo que no tuve problema), y seg√∫n la p√°gina oficial soportar√° Chrome OS con actualizaciones hasta 2026.No es perfecta, hay que decirlo; los bordes de la pantalla en especial en el inferior me parecen innecesariamente gruesos, y recomiendo a todos los que la vayan a comprar, comprar la versi√≥n de 64 GB ya que la que compr√© es de 32 GB y 2 d√≠as despu√©s solo me quedaban 8 GB de memoria disponible. Tiene soporte para MicroSD, pero las aplicaciones no se pueden instalar all√≠.En general recomiendo este Chromebook para toda persona que necesite un hibrido tablet-computador o requiera de un dispositivo para tareas b√°sicas como office o navegaci√≥n, as√≠ como personas que busquen un computador secundario. En mi caso, fue todo lo que necesitaba y hasta m√°s.","Lenovo Chromebook C340 2-in-1-11.6"" HD Touchscreen - Celeron N4000-4GB - 32GB eMMC - Gray (Renewed)",&140

5,Savingdogs,"August 21, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Can't beat the quality for the price.,"We ordered the chromebook for our daughter as she was going to be learning remotely from home 3 days a week and our home PC is too slow now to handle the load of remote learning. The price was the first thing that attracted us.  The package arrived earlier than it was originally stated and right away we notuced that the box and the packaging looked like it was a new item.  We dug right in and opened the box and I have to say this Chromebook looked new, brand new.  There was nothing that pointed to a refurbished unit.  The battery had some charge so it started up right away.  After the initial setup of users, language, locations, etc., we started putting it it to work.  The screen was bright and crisp.  The touchscreen is responsive and effortless in use.  We chose the smaller screen as it cut the weight and fit in our daughter's backpack so at home, she has a second monitor to work on any applications while the main screen is for video conferencing. This chromebook handles the added screen with out any issues.  The built in camera works great and produced very clean video.  I had a pleasant experience from ordering upto now.

6,Brandon,"April 13, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Great Chromebook for the price,"I had never heard of this brand and always had ASUS or Acer chromebooks in the past, so when my latest one dropped off the counter and needed replacement, I tried this Lenovo.  This was one of the most inexpensive choices I could have made and I went for ""refurbished"" just because it was less.  What a good deal!  It is quick, sharp, easy to get started on and nice and lightweight. Keyboard is easy to use and overall quality is good.  I had a little more trouble connecting well with Facetime on this and that is about the only thing negative I have noted.  Overall, this would be a great purchase for someone wanting a good chromebook at an entry price.  It came packaged like new and looked perfect.

25,Calvin Sangster,"December 26, 2021",2.0 out of 5 stars,It was the thought that counted. Wishful thinking!,So I bought this for my wife for Christmas. I had high hopes for it and she was very excited. Once she turned it on and started going throb the motions to set it up it I saw her face get more and more disappointed. The keys were sticking and she couldn't type anything. Everytime she pressed a key 4 j's would pop up or 3 g's. We couldn't use the keyboard at all.  So in the box it goes and it goes back. Renewed or not you shouldn't go through that trouble right out of the box. The touchscreen seemed good and it's a nice looking laptop though despite the keyboard being a problem. But because of the good reviews we will try a replacement.

This was one of the most inexpensive choices I could have made and I went for ""refurbished"" just because it was less.  What a good deal!  It is quick, sharp, easy to get started on and nice and lightweight. Keyboard is easy to use and overall quality is good.  I had a little more trouble connecting well with Facetime on this and that is about the only thing negative I have noted.  Overall, this would be a great purchase for someone wanting a good chromebook at an entry price.  It came packaged like new and looked perfect.  Thank you Amazon.","Lenovo Chromebook C340 2-in-1-11.6"" HD Touchscreen - Celeron N4000-4GB - 32GB eMMC - Gray (Renewed)",&140
47,Penguinlvr,"October 11, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Convenient for taking notes on the go but not quick access to them,"Not a bad laptop for the traveling note taker but it does run a little slow and sometimes it takes so long to load up a document that it can be difficult trying to reference something on the fly. The chrome OS is also pretty limiting, a lot of programs simply aren‚Äôt available to download for it.","Lenovo Chromebook C340 2-in-1-11.6"" HD Touchscreen - Celeron N4000-4GB - 32GB eMMC - Gray (Renewed)",&140
48,Michael,"April 4, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good Buy,I was weary of purchasing a renewed product but was pleasantly surprised to find the product well-packed and in great condition. I have not found any scrathes or other cosmetic flaws that would indicate it was renewed and not new. I love the aluminum chassis and the polished finish. I love that I can use it either as a laptop or a tablet due to the 2-in-1 design. It is lightweight and easy to carry or sit on my lap while I work. I've been impressed with the battery life and the touchscreen is nice to work with. I've only had the laptop 2.5 days but it's been working great. It suits my needs exactly.,"Lenovo Chromebook C340 2-in-1-11.6"" HD Touchscreen - Celeron N4000-4GB - 32GB eMMC - Gray (Renewed)",&140
