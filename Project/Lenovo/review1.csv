1,David Anderson,"May 2, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice and fast,Nice and fast could use a little more ram. The only things I real don't like is that you can only top off the ram to 12gb. Nice big screen though and it has a very fast 6 core  processor that's one reason I bought it. Doesn't come with a bunch of bloat ware either. In the description it doesn't tell you but it has biometric login which is nice. Would like to wipe it and run Linux on it  I grown used to Linux  but I don't want to get rid of a licensed copy of Widows.

10,Jason Casareno,"August 30, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good Laptop For Work + Casual Gaming,"Just received the laptop today and had no noticable problems with the laptop itself.Starting up the laptop and after setting everything up I had no issues.Edit: After about 3 months of usage, I still have a good feeling about this laptop.One thing I would like to mention is the RAM. I am a Comp Sci student and one of the software I needed for my course was very RAM heavy (Android Studio is anyone is interested). The 8GB of RAM mentioned is true however you will only get to use about 6GB. This is because the hardware reserves 2GB of ram to actually run the laptop (I think?). In summary, if you are going to be using RAM heavy software, I would recommend going for a 16GB laptop instead (which was my mistake, sadly).","Lenovo IdeaPad 3 14 Laptop, Intel Core i3-1005G1, 4GB RAM, 128GB Storage, 14.0"" FHD Display, Windows 10 S",&328

The keyboard is also not ergonomic and comfortable to use, slowing the typing process. the wireless network adapter is faulty as well.
