0,brissa,"November 22, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,amazing laptop for the price,"i upgraded from a 4 years old 230 dollar HP laptop that could barely run firefox with so much lag. so far this laptop is so much better and its amazing for the price. it may not be the most high end laptop with the best display or graphics card or processor or whatever but it does the job excellently for the specs it has. i didn't expect much from this laptop because its a midrange laptop but it blew all expectations away.i have only had this for like 3 days though, so i'll make an edit later if i encounter any problems.ABOUT SHIPPING:first off it was delivered by UPS. im very pleased with the speed at which this was delivered. i didnt expect it to be delivered so quickly considering i ordered it right before thanksgiving, but it actually came in on the same week that i ordered it (ordered on wednesday and it was delivered that very same friday!!!!).the packaging had very little damage to it. the lenovo box came inside an enormous amazon prime box that had no padding to stop the lenovo box from moving around during shipping. inside the lenovo box, the laptop was very snugly fit inside two styrofoam holders and didnt move at all when i shook it. laptop arrived in perfect condition.ABOUT THE LAPTOP:the battery on this thing is decent. its not the longest running battery but its also not the worst. its just ok. i mostly just have my laptop plugged into the wall with conservator mode on to preserve battery life.the screen is also ok. miles better than my old HP but its not a high end display. it has decent colors and the blacks look good to decent depending on your settings and calibration.its very fast and does multitasking with very little to zero lag. ive ran photoshop, firefox, and discord on it at the same time with no issues, which used to be impossible on my old laptop. i can run games like genshin impact in medium graphics settings with almost no lag. its good for light gaming. dont expect to be able to play a game like the witcher 3 or assasin's creed on this though.the speakers are not that good. theyre just ok. not as terrible as others are claiming, though. the speakers are at the bottom of the chassis which means that the sound can be amplified if you put it on a hard surface. without the amplification the sound is pretty quiet.one thing is that it tends to overheat when doing very intensive things like gaming. i suggest putting the laptop at an angle so that the air circulates better at the bottom if you ever do anything thats super intense on this.also it comes with a finger print reader (its decent) and a backlit keyboard. the backlit keyboard especially is what interested me in this laptop because its almost unheard of to have them in laptops of this price range.for lack of a better word, the camera is total shit. i wont be using the camera at all on this but if you need the camera for whatever reason than either buy a good webcam or shop elsewhere. it has a privacy shutter too.the chassis is this dark blue plastic thats made to look like brushed aluminum. i think it looks pretty. its a bit flimsy though. if you press down on it with minimal force itll flex, so treat this laptop with care. if youre the kind of person that needs a sturdy laptop than this probably isn't for you. after all you get what you pay for.all in all i dont have many complaints about this. i have my expectations tempered because i knew i wasn't going to get a high end laptop considering the price range, but this performed even better than expected. its a good buy for the price and i really really love this purchase so far.","Lenovo IdeaPad 3 14 Laptop, AMD Ryzen 5 5500U, 8GB RAM, 256GB Storage, 14.0"" FHD Display, AMD Radeon 7 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Abyss Blu",&517

4,AH in MA,"April 10, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,"It's okay, but some shortcomings","As context, my prior laptop was a Macbook Pro, and I was looking to get away from Macs and have a functional replacement to do office work (i.e., MS Office type stuff) and telehealth/zoom meetings. I figured I did not need to spend a ton of money to get that. I really, really wish I had spent more. The camera is not very good, and I've gotten feedback from others that the mic is not good either. I could get peripherals to replace those, but I don't want to have to do that. The screen is great- wide screen is so much more functional than my old laptop, but the quality is just not what I have been accustomed to. The colors are wan comparatively, and it's harder to use in different lighting situations. It also needs to be at just the right angle to see colors properly. I do love that it has a keyboard/keypad combo, and the keyboard itself is satisfying for typing. The trackpad is meh but gets the job done. Better with an external mouse. Finally, the laptop is light and seems to run well overall (especially after removing some of the bloatware installed on it).Overall, it's fine for work that requires MS Office and general web surfing, but I am really disappointed with its performance on Zoom and Teams, and I now have my old, dying Mac hooked up for that purpose, and I switch between them. I work four hours per day on a telehealth zoom connection, so this computer is not as functional for me as I had hoped it would be.","Lenovo IdeaPad 3 14 Laptop, AMD Ryzen 5 5500U, 8GB RAM, 256GB Storage, 14.0"" FHD Display, AMD Radeon 7 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Abyss Blu",&517
5,Michael L.,"August 6, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,No case option,"The computer is fine, for our daughter, for high school. My biggest problem is, there is no hard case protective option to buy for this laptop. It is one of the most popular laptops, and there isn’t a single Lenovo, or generic, option to protect it.","Lenovo IdeaPad 3 14 Laptop, AMD Ryzen 5 5500U, 8GB RAM, 256GB Storage, 14.0"" FHD Display, AMD Radeon 7 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Abyss Blu",&517
6,Fult,"August 22, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Value Ryzen Laptop,"First off, don't let the title scare you, it's a great deal. The screen, unlike previous iterations, is gorgeous for the price - crisp and detailed. You can probably find the specs elsewhere complaining about SRGB coverage, but for the average user, sub $500, it's great. Seems like it gets close to 300 nits, definitely bright enough indoors. Keyboard is very nice, not MacBook Air or the like, but very close - much better than Acer/Asus/Samsung. Trackpad along the same lines, very good overall, if you really want to nitpick, the clicking of it wasn't the best on the edges for right/left click. Sound was decent, definitely a laptop speaker and does not get too loud. Fan noise isn't noticeable unless you're used to absolute quiet, the fans spun up under load when setting things up and windows updates, quiet and not grating on the ears. Build quality won't wow anyone at the coffee shop but the plastic resembles brushed metal and it's appealing over, say, the millionth grey laptop. Moderately serviceable under the hood, with one ram stick being soldered on (4 gb). Ignore the other reviews bashing Amazon's delivery service instead of the product itself, this is a sleeper Windows laptop. Highly recommended for research/browsing, writing, and light gaming.","Lenovo IdeaPad 3 14 Laptop, AMD Ryzen 5 5500U, 8GB RAM, 256GB Storage, 14.0"" FHD Display, AMD Radeon 7 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Abyss Blu",&517
7,Brandon Lopez,"February 10, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Multipurpose Laptop,"This has to be one of my best investments so far. I am satisfied with how this laptop performs because it seems to work good enough with most tasks you throw at it. It doesn’t freeze after having 10 tabs open with Spotify in the background. It runs GTA V and BeamNG on low settings at 45-60fps. It works smoothly with Photoshop, Blender and other workstations. Its just perfect for light gaming, browsing, editing pictures and more. Do keep in mind that the integrated GPU from the Ryzen 5 does need 2gb of ram, which takes it from the only source of ram available; your 8gb of ram. Nevertheless 6gb seems to work flawlessly, its just something to keep up in mind.","Lenovo IdeaPad 3 14 Laptop, AMD Ryzen 5 5500U, 8GB RAM, 256GB Storage, 14.0"" FHD Display, AMD Radeon 7 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Abyss Blu",&517
8,stephen krause,"February 20, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Budget Laptop I Have Ever Owned,"A lot of budget laptops have lots of bloatware. It can be very disappointing and frustrating. I hate that.  Not with this laptop! Hardly any bloatware! Nothing slows it down, not even the cloud when I had to set it up. I bought it for that reason, and I must say that I am getting more than I expected. Especially for something that's in the $600 range. I am very impressed! The Lenovo IdeaPad 3 14 is the best budget laptop I have ever purchased. I was on the edge of buying a $1,000 laptop but took a gamble and went $400 cheaper with this one. Best decision ever!

I am a cybersecurity major, and I have used this thing to run Linux VMs and python coding, to playing Minecraft on my off days. This thing is a tiny powerhouse. I have had no issues since I bought it in September. I did add my own ram, so it has 12 gigs, and I threw in an SSD I had laying around. This thing is a blessing.

11,J. Martin,"October 22, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent,"I've been on budget laptops for years and wanted the Ryzen 5 chip, was waiting for the Acer 5 to come out with it but hasn't so I bought this and don't regret it. It's slightly chunky in thickness but has a good feel and imho a really nice keyboard. The screen is sharp and better than what I've had with Acer with zero dead pixels. As I expected the user experience running various apps is very fast and smooth, cpu usage low and fan rarely comes on (except when facebook is running in the browser).  Battery - coming from an Acer swift with a 5w processor and 16 hrs per charge, I'm getting 8 which is quite ok considering the better processor. Taken care of this laptop will be good for years.","Lenovo IdeaPad 3 14 Laptop, AMD Ryzen 5 5500U, 8GB RAM, 256GB Storage, 14.0"" FHD Display, AMD Radeon 7 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Abyss Blu",&517
