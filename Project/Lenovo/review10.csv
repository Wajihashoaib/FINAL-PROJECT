0,Anthony,"December 23, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Laptop - Highly Responsive and Great Touch Screen,"Overall, I would say the laptop is great. It is definitely worth the price of around $300. It is small, lightweight (although could be more), responsive, looks great, smells new after months, smooth to use, track pad is pretty good,overall good chromebook.I'm not really too much of a Tech person but grew up with computers in my 20's mostly using it for school and personal stuff.I had it for a few months now so my beginning concerns aren't the same as my latter ones. I'll try to go over really quickly the basic beginning concerns I had then go through with my impressions with months of use later on. 1366 X 768 isn't HD but it's acceptable. Processing speed is 2.1 ghz, never had a problem or issue with lags. 4 gb ram is okay, probably wouldnt do 2 gb. 11.6 screen, I wanted something smaller so this is a plus to me. Bit heavy with 2.64 lbs for a small laptop but it's okay, still my lightest one. internet connection is good and bluetooth use was good. Processor never had a problem with Mediatek. Convertible to tablet mode is a plus. Solid state so processes quickly which is a big plus. Battery life is great, I hate charging and finding an outlet, but this goes on for more than 8-10 hours, just doing school stuff, no videos. I would say I searched like crazy in the beginning. I wanted one main personal laptop and one small convertible laptop and this was the best convertible one I could find on Amazon. I compared like 20+ laptops over a week, I was really putting a ridiculous amount of time on it. But I had specific things I wanted in mine, like speed, aesthetics, smooth performance, and valued those more than other things. I wanted things to be really convenient.I have started using chromebooks more because they are inexpensive and very convenient to use. They aren't too good for hardcore processing, but for school work or personal work, it meets all my needs. Whenever I use it, everything is pretty smooth and seamless. Start and shut down are almost instant. I have never had an issue with it's use so far. I think for me, the biggest plus is the elegance. It makes everything very easy to use, it looks great, it even retains its new smell after some months with light use. My other laptops have poor track pads but this one is infinitely better. I don't feel the need to use a wireless mouse as well. I ended up getting a screen protector for it for almost $20 because it was a touch screen. I like how it has a lot of features like hdmi cables, one usbs, even a memory card slot. I think for the price, it is definitely worth it. It feels like a very high end chromebook, although I generally wouldn't pay too much for a laptop in general because I don't need high processing. The buttons feel nice and smooth. There hasn't been much lag or delay time. Updates are easy and smooth. Screen is nice to look at and the colors are great. There doesn't seem to be much glare and it feels aesthetically pleasing. Yeah everything's really nice with this.There are some things I don't like about it though. Originally, I had planned to use this as a tablet part-time because I didn't want to buy paper textbooks. I thought of using all of it on this chromebook, but it turned out to not be convenient because it was too heavy. I would use it on the train and my hands would almost immediately get tired trying to read. I would have to rest is down on myself, which isn't a big deal but wanted something I could read ebooks and pdfs on conveniently. I don't know if I will end up getting another one to serve that purpose. It also is a chromebook so it cannot download files and stuff. I don't particularly like that because that stops it from being my main computer. I don't like putting personal stuff on my drive, like my expenses or whatever even though it is irrational and I do it with some apps. Maybe I should, but the fact that everything is on my drive to see makes me feel a bit uncomfortable. I don't mind that this computer cannot really do much without internet because I always have something saved on it. It has 64 gb of memory which I think is quite significant. I mean, if I couldn't put anything on the drive, I wouldn't feel that, but 64 gb + drive storage seems more than enough and I am trying to be a minimalist anyway. Yeah not that many cons.Anyway, I wanted a inexpensive laptop but this definitely performs up to par with most laptops. Never had a problem with it so far months into my purchase but did want something I could use as a tablet. Would definitely recommend. Definitely better than a lot of the stuff I grew up with that cost 3x more. Best laptop I could find and really pleasantly surprised overall in many areas.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289
1,Groingo,"March 31, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,A very  unexpected surprise!,"Renewed Lenovo C330 arrived in a huge box clearly marked HEAVY LOAD....someone had a sense of humor being that the whole thing weighed only 4 pounds and you could have put ten of these in boxes inside their big box!Opening the box the description had said it had cosmetic damage on the sides and gouges on the case, close inspection revealed no damage, it was MINT condition plus the moment I cracked the lid open it was already setting itself up and after a couple of minutes it was ready to go, (try that WINDOWS!) it had syncd itself from my other Chromebook!The main reason I bought the Lenovo Chromebook was to see first hand how it compared to the two Acer Chromebooks I have, the Acer Spin 713 and the Acer R13, both having a lot of aggrivating issues relating to OS integration.Acer both 713 and R13 had serious issues with poor sound loudness and quality, image quality is poor even though they were running over 2000 resolution, poor internet speed as both 713 and R13 kept switching to lower speed settings, while virtual keyboard settings in both Acer's suffered from serious lag, and screen fragmentation, Bluetooth pairing was poor with continual drops and no restart if computer woke from sleep and slower overall performance on and offline if used as a tablet.Lenovo: Suffers from none of the above and excel's in many areas starting with Sound which is LOUD, image quality even with a low 1366 resolution is tight, sharp, and vivid, internet speed stayed where you put it and is quick, virtual keyboard no issues, Bluetooth pairs easily and is ready after sleep with no drops, tablet performance no different, quick and precise.I agree with some other comments that this is a really handsome computer, the eggshell white with dark grey keys is a real eye catcher, that backed up by a great overall experience and I just noticed the price for these as renewed from the Amazon Warehouse has dropped, you will NOT be dissapointed!Now for the real twist:  I have bought 9 different Chromebooks over the past couple of months to see if they had that something special that makes them indespensible and I must honestly say that my Fire Tablets 7 through 10 and ONLY the Fire Tablets are much more useful, easy to use, take a ton less space, have much broader uses, easier to take with, typically much higher video, image and sound quality and much faster on the internet and cost waaaay less but give you so much more, so the grand experiment is done and I will be finding some good homes for the Chromebooks.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289
2,Josh Hartman,"November 30, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Far exceeded my expectations,"Full disclosure, I am not an IT professional but use laptops, tablets, and desktop computers daily in my personal and work life. This chromebook has far exceeded my expectations. This is my first time using a chromebook. I have had a week or so to really dig into the device. I own an alienware gaming laptop, but I find myself only using it now for gaming purposes only.This chromebook is fast in my opinion. The speed is snappy and the device responds quickly to gestures and commands. I have yet to find sometime I can't do on this that I do on my windows laptop aside from gaming. One game I like to play requires windows, mac, or linux. Since this has an ARM processor it does not support linux applications at this time.Design: This device is a bright attractive white chromebook. I find the design to be pleasing to the eye and appears sturdy even though it is made from plastic. I do not particularly like using it in tablet mode. The screen feels bulky and sometimes unmanageable in tablet mode. The screen quickly transitions to whatever position to place it in whether laptop, tent, or tablet mode. I personal find myself not even using my LG tablet for much of anything except when I need LTE internet away from home. Overall the design is great.Screen/Input: I find the keyboard to be on par with most laptop keyboards. The keys are a little shallow and I feel my typing has slowed a little bit, but not by much. The IPS touchscreen is very responsive and rarely find myself having to touch the screen more than once for my intended gesture. Screen is bright in home conditions, but feel it would lack in more intense lighting situations, such as outdoors.Ease of Use: The google play store makes this thing be able to do just about anything. I have not tried any intense applications. I use chrome, netflix, hulu, evernote, several banking apps, and various other apps. All of them are snappy responsive. The bank apps load like they are in phone mode, thus they are in a small window. The apps still work as designed. Netflix and Hulu playback is smooth and pleasant to watch on the screen.Overall, I am impressed with the Google OS and this device in general. If your someone who is on the fence about the operating system, I suggest you give it a try. The battery life is good as well. When using my gaming laptop its always with a cord tethered nearby. I also understand a gaming laptop is far more power intensive. I have yet to use this chromebook while charging it. The battery has allowed me to watch 4-5 hours of netflix, talk on facebook, and text through my phone without ever getting critically low. I charge it at night and then never put it back on till the next night. This is a max screen brightness. I was also very surprised with the speakers. The speakers were much louder and not distorted. I honestly expected them to be cheap netbook quality that is mostly better just to never use them, but thats not the case with this chromebook. I do generally use a bluetooth headset. The bluetooth headset paired with extreme simplicity. I also set up my brother wireless laser printer with google cloud print in less than 30 seconds.Google did it right and lenovo delivered a solid product. I did purchase this on sale for $200 but would have spent the $300. If your a web surfer, music listener, netflix watcher I highly recommend this. If you need windows intense software then go with windows. Otherwise I think you'll find yourself using this as your primary device as I have.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289

6,John,"August 22, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Chromebook but with a few nitpicks,"I was curious on what a chromebook had to offer since i never used or owned one and i'm in need of a laptop since i'm living somewhere else.This chromebook is fairly light and small and gets the job done and there little to no wait time when you open the chromebook turning on automatically.There a bunch of things i noticed while using it is you can link your phone with the chromebook in where once you previously log into the chromebook beforehand you can unlock your chromebook right after by unlocking your phone (both have to have bluetooth enable). To search up shortcuts you can easily click the search button on the keyboard and type in shortcut and it have it where you can search all the shortcuts you can do and what nice is any additional keyboard say a bluetooth one can also do some of the shortcuts.Also there are options where you can close the laptop and you have two options you can either put the laptop to sleep or it just turns off the screen then there a option to lock it by closing it or not. nice note is if you have display off you can still listen to pandora,mp3,or youtube.Also for those who are wondering - you can play minecraft, ragnorak mobile (not fully keyboard control it only for texting in chat so no WASD movement) and hearthstone on it so it have it nice touch but you cant use the split screen feature from chrome so that a bummer now for the drawbacks. Also you can use microsoft word, excel and powerpoint from the googleplay store but you would need a account for it or just use the free online version.This is small nit pick - the screen is 720p yet it clear but it is noticeable when you use it long enough wish it was HD or 1080p also some apps are set to the 720p by default. the google play store youtube uses the quality of the screen while chrome youtube (basically youtube normally on browser) is more clear. Also skype doesn't have screenshare or sharesound so that a major bummer and skype seem to run slow on the chromebook in terms having people sharescreen their desktop it always come out blurry on some occasions and i have to minimize and reopen skype to actually see what going on. i haven't try video call yet so it up to debate. Lastly for discord from google playstore you would need to adjust some of the call setting for it to work. the default setting would cut you off mid sentence and random pausing in between.Another thing is you can't adjust the idle timer it either it goes to sleep, display turns off or stays on there no option to change it and when you have option to lock your desktop it end your skype call so you would have to go into settings for normal use, call use, and game use.lastly is your better off having your laptop go into sleep mode with locked instead of turning it off. when you shut it down the screen goes blank white then gets brighter and brighter then goes to black. it's just me being paranoid like it would be better if it just dims and turns off instead of going very bright then poof black not to mention if you usually play on medium to low brightness setting then having your screen go maximum brightness with no setting to change it get annoying not to mention when you open up your chromebook after shutting it off it adjusted your brightness setting as well as well a bright chrome logo before going into login. Mostly this is a nit pick since it bothersome when you are using it in middle of the night then when you turn it off it hit you with the brightest setting so i just end up closing it to sleep mode or shut off and look away.All in all it a pretty good chromebook i just wish it had more options in the settings as well have priority app settings in task manager","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289

9,THG,"September 8, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Incredible value for the price,"I bought this computer while on a trip to replace a different Lenovo computer that died while I was on deadline for an assignment while traveling. Fortunately, I was able to get this next-day Prime delivered to where I was staying in LA and began using it minutes after it arrived. To make this review easy, I'm breaking it down by main key features: display, keyboard, battery life, and build quality.Display: For the price, I don't think you're going to find one much nicer in terms of resolution and quality. Incredibly, you are getting a true IPS panel with nice viewing angles. I've found that the low res matte displays on other cheaper Chromebooks are incredibly difficult use and lead to eye strain. I'm a personal believer in purchasing as much screen real estate and pixel density as possible -- it really does make a huge difference. Another huge plus (and I'm not sure if this across the Chromebook line or specific to this one) is the night mode that cuts out blue light and boosts yellows -- this is another hugely important feature for me, personally. Touch screen functionality works fine. Display cons are that the bezels are massive and with it being super glossy, there can be lots of glare.Keyboard: Basically Lenovo has it figured out with keyboard layouts and feel. While it's nowhere near as nice as the Thinkpad keyboard, this one is laid out quite nicely and is easy to complete bigger writing assignments on. There's no backlight, which would be a huge plus, but for the price, it's difficult to find anything to complain about. The top row function keys will be familiar to those coming from the Mac ecosystem. Everything is very easy. The trackpad is also surprisingly nice for the price as well. Gestures work without issue.Battery life: This is where this computer truly shines. I purchased this while I was traveling during the winter and needed to it to complete weekly freelance assignments and had plenty of battery life while on the road. Even when being back home laying in bed watching Youtube or Netflix, the battery lasts all night, and then some. I basically never take the charger with me because I don't feel that it's necessary (unless it's already low on juice). In terms of just general surfing and Google doc stuff, you should be able to get a couple of days out of the battery. If you're watching videos and streaming, it's still a good full day's worth of battery life.Build quality: I've previously had an HP Chromebook and was not impressed by the build quality by any means. It felt cheap, almost like a toy. While this Lenovo Chromebook feels much more solid, I still wouldn't compare it to a Thinkpad or the higher end machines in Lenovo's lineup. Still, it feels quite durable and I've never worried about carrying it in a pack all day, or stacking books and other heavy items on top of it. The only thing that is kind of a bother is that the brilliant white finish does get smudges and dirty fingerprints on it. But that's more of a nuisance, not a flaw with the machine.For the price, you really can't do much better. So long as you have reasonable expectations for what you're getting and how much you're paying, you will be very pleased by this product.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289

13,James M.,"February 9, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,First Chromebook.  Very Impressed.,"Regarding Chrome OS.  This is my first chromebook so I'm still learning, but so far I'm extremely impressed!  It seems like the chromebook was the computer I've always needed but never realized I wanted!  Marrying the pc experience to an android compatible operating system is magical.  Although I'm apprehensive about this browser-based computing, I've found it very easy to save and edit documents offline so I'm still able to work on the go.  I can also connect it to my android phone, send and receive text messages with it, emulate old school video games (GBC, NES, SNES, GBA, and NDS), connect it to my bluetooth speakers and blast some jams.  I regret not making Chrome OS a part of my life MUCH sooner!Regarding performance.  I've heard people say this processor is mediocre.  I have to ask, what are those people even doing to arrive at the conclusion?!  I have not once seen the slightest indication that this thing isn't *completely* competent for daily needs.  Incredible response time.  No lag when scrolling.  Minimal to no delay opening apps.  Stunningly fast start up time.  I feel like it's a pretty outstanding performer, overall.  Sure, it's no high end gaming machine, but who buys a Chromebook looking for advanced gaming capabilities?  The bottom line: you click; the computer responds instantly.  Really, what more could you ask for?Regarding the build quality.  It's a bit bulky in its ""tablet"" mode and lacks the premium build materials of high end chromebooks, but it still looks and feels great - certainly better than any laptop PC I've ever owned!  The white color is gorgeous.  The size is perfect.  The keyboard is comfortable and the touch pad is large and responsive.  If you look closely you'll see Lenovo coated the touch pad with a hefty clear coat to prevent wear and tear.  As someone who immediately coats touch pads with contact paper to prevent damage, this is an impressive step, however inconspicuous to the average user.  Additionally the hinge feels solid and smooth.  The construction of the entire build just feels extremely sturdy.  The monitor produces extremely sharp images with outstanding color.  Although many people express dissatisfaction with the lack of 1080p and the larger bezels framing the monitor, I didn't even notice!  If you're not planning to do professional photo editing, I doubt you'll notice either.  (Side note: If bezels really concern you, consider the experience of flipping this into tablet mode and walking around with it while working.  Wider bezels in this situation result in fewer accidental screen taps from fingers that are curled around the edges holding it.)I absolutely recommend this chromebook.  It's a steal at this price point, and stands to replace my quad core, 8gb Windows 10 laptop for most of my computing needs.  Sure, it's not a 1080p monitor, lacks a backlit keyboard, and isn't made out of aluminum, but goodness gracious if isn't the coolest, most practical little laptop I've ever owned.It was even featured as one of the best chromebooks money can buy as of Feb 2019 by Android Police and Android Authority!!","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289

15,Nick B,"February 8, 2019",4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent value for the money!,"I'm on the second week now of using the Lenovo C330 convertible Chromebook (there are multiple models on the site under C330 so I'm specifying it is the model with 4GB RAM, 64GB SSD,  MediaTek MT8173C processor). I needed to replace my 9 year old Macbook Pro that was an excellent machine but just couldn't handle modern computing needs. However, I have a desktop for more intense computing needs, so I really didn't want to spend $1000+ on a new MacBook to browse the web, watch YouTube videos, read eBooks, watch Netflix etc in the evening. Cheap laptops in the sub $350 range are frankly almost all junk, so I wasn't really interested in buying one of those either. I don't want a tablet because I want a keyboard and I like to lie flat in bed and that's just not convenient.Enter the Chromebook! So far, this has been an impressive solution for the purchase price of $231. Of course, Chromebooks have a variety of hardware and you need to do your homework to get the best experience. For about $50 more than lesser Chrombooks, this is an ideal middle ground solution. Within its comparable price range, the MediaTek MT8173C processor scores at the top as far as processing speed. Coupled with 4GB DDR3 RAM and a 64 GB SSD for boot speed, plus how lightweight of an OS ChromeOS is, this is a very well performing little machine for the price. Web browsing is snappy, YouTube loads very quickly and the Google Play store gives you access to all the apps you need. So far, all apps have loaded without any issues and function well. The battery life is remarkable - I've gotten 13-14 hours of use from it and still had 15% when I finally plugged it in. ChromeOS is super easy to learn/user friendly and reminds me of the user experience of a phone/tablet.NOW - this machine is not a few things. It doesn't have a super high resolution screen, but it's a small screen, so it's not bad, but if you're used to a Retina screen it will be a bit lower in quality. It is fine and perfectly functional, but not exceptional, as a tablet (not the best touch screen response and obviously heavier than normal tablets and ChromeOS isn't as optimized for touch screen use compared to phone/tablet operating systems - think things like bigger front/back/X buttons - those aren't as prevalent on ChromeOS). The keypad is nice and sensitive but the click is loud. Printing is probably a pain but I have a desktop for that, so I don't care. So far, those are really the only cons I have found to this machine, but the pros far outweigh and you need to be realistic about features vs. price. It does a lot of things really well at the current list price of $251. It is not a $1000 laptop and you simply can't expect $1000 features from it.I'm very glad I spent the extra money for this over the sub-$200 Chromebooks with lower quality hardware and no convertible/touch screens. The convertible/touch really makes it fun to use.So, in summary: If you just need a machine to do run of the mill browsing, streaming, etc I think this is an almost perfect solution and an excellent value for the money.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289

17,tani,"March 19, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Works great... after updating.,"Right out of the box, we got it set up and started checking on different apps. Every issue we had with the little Chromebook was resolved after we updated it, except for an issue with forever being stuck on the loading screen for Audible.The issues we had right out of the box, which were fixed on update, were: Netflix was low quality (but every other streaming app worked fine), Audible would not load (didnt fix on update), couldn't scroll down on pages anywhere especially bad in Settings, and we had to minimize the Settings app every time we selected something otherwise it would pretend it was stuck. Now that its working after update, I have NO ISSUES that would cause me to be upset with the device. No Audible is fine, I use my phone for that 99% of the time, we just wanted to have it on the Chromebook because it was an available app, so no big deal on our end.  I will say that I don't use the volume speakers on the Chromebook (I use bluetooth headphones and speaker) but it is about as good as a cheap device is expected to have (it wont rock your world musically, no real bass), some people might have an issue with this.  I also do not use it to play any sort of game, so I don't have any feedback on using it that way.Altogether, I would buy this again in a heartbeat! Great product that handles me having many applications and Chrome tabs open at once.Update: After a few days of hard use, the machine is running excellently. Its able to work efficiently with multiple tabs and apps running at the same time, including video and audio streaming. My only complaints are that the screen wobbles slightly if used as a touchscreen in a laptop-position, folding it back into a laptop-position from a V or tablet-position feels concerning as the hinge is sort of tight and it makes you feel like you might break it if you go too fast or carelessly, and when using the keyboard the edge of the chromebook can bite into my wrists if I rest them on it but that's easily resolved by not placing the chromebook in a position higher than my hands sit. Still a great machine and would buy again!","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289
18,Kaleb,"September 27, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Incredible Chromebook,"This is my first Chromebook. I decided to get one because most of what I use a computer for doesn't require anything more heavy duty than what this has to offer. I'll still use my other computer should I require things like Photoshop or those heavier use programs, but since I got my Chromebook a week ago, I haven't even touched my other laptop.The Pros:Battery life - When it estimates that I have 12-13 hours of battery life, it means it. I can stream videos and multitask and it doesn't sacrifice that time. Time to charge is also impressively quick.Speed - I open the lid and it's on. It's that simple. No waiting for everything to load up. I had to do an update and it took maybe 10 seconds, including restart time. I know internet will vary depending on network, but I'm able to easily multitask and it's not dragging. I'm currently casting a video to my TV and have multiple tabs open on chrome, all with no lag to the video (which would often happen with my other laptop).Ease of use - If you're already a chrome/google user, switching over to a chromebook is a piece of cake. I didn't have to transfer anything, and I do have to eventually back a few more things up to my Drive, but again, that's easy. Getting used to more app-based programs than desktop ones is easy enough too.  Almost everything that would have required a windows download has an app version or a way to use it on a chromebook as well.Screen/Tablet mode - I haven't toyed too much with the touch screen, but it's a nice perk. I like being able to flip the screen around and turn it to the side and bam, it's a big tablet. So far I've only used it like this once to read some comics, but it was nice. Brightness is great too. I usually have it down halfway or less even.Size - I was worried about it being too small because my other laptop is somewhere between 13-14'' but it's a really great size. This thing is incredibly light too. Much lighter than I'd expected. Love it.The Cons, though extremely minor:Caps Lock - Mostly, it's a ""getting used to"" factor that I just haven't quite mastered yet. There's no caps lock key, and the search button that replaces it isn't terrible, but I think I'd have preferred to just have the caps key. (You can just press alt+search for caps lock easily enough though)Backlighting - my other computer had backlit keys. Totally an ""extra"" that's not necessary, but regardless.And that's it. If you're looking for something light and simple for everyday use, this is an incredible choice.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289
19,W. Walsh,"July 11, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Outstanding Value in a Chromebook,"This is the closest thing I've seen to the perfect Chromebook. It's fast, the touchscreen works well, there's plenty of local storage (32 and 64GB versions exist -- I went for the 64GB model) if you want it, and the battery life just goes on and on. This is the first laptop I've owned that goes for days between charges with usage time of a few hours per day. You can even use it as a tablet if you want to: just flip the screen around and there you are!I have a few Intel Celeron-based Chromebooks of similar age from competing manufacturers and this thing handily outperforms all of them.A few releases of Chrome OS (around the version 76-80 mark, and again sometime around beta versions 87/89 when the kernel was upgraded to version 4.19) demonstrated buggy behavior on this platform, but that seems to be all gone now.If you're buying this today, you'll want to be mindful of Google's automatic updates expiration policy, which is set in mid-2025 for this model. (It'll be here sooner than you think!) You can still use the Chromebook after that time, though you will not get any further software updates. Intel and AMD-based Chromebook models can sometimes be made to run other operating systems. Hopefully someone will do the same for ARM based models such as this Lenovo C330. I can definitely see myself still using this after 2025, if the battery and SSD hold out, and I'm fairly sure both will.There's really only thing I've ever found lacking from the Lenovo C330, and that's a backlit keyboard. Had Lenovo equipped it with one, this truly would have been the perfect Chromebook.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289
20,Amazon Customer,"April 21, 2020",1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't Buy- Lenovo Customer Service is Absolutely Horrendously Unhelpful,"Wow, what can I say.  For a product that is 5 months old let me list the ways that this has been a terrible experience.  Amazon, it's not your fault.  You need to stop selling Lenovo's products, though.1) The first day out of the box the unit failed to start up properly.  We used Lenovo's chat service and after zero troubleshooting attempts they decided that the unit was broken and we should mail it back to them for a repair/replacement.  It was Christmas morning, you try telling that to a kid.  After a few google searches, we figured out the obvious issue, and it started up beautifully.  This was my first foray into the most unhelpful customer service experience I've ever had.  Send it back??? OK, or try everything else first??2) After 3 weeks my son opened the unit and there was a hairline crack in the touchscreen from one corner to the next.  This never affected functionality, but one day while bored during COVID-19 lockdown, I again (stupidly) opened the chat and asked whether the screen could get repaired under a warranty because the reason for the break was not because we had done anything to damage it.  The answer was no, I should drop it off at BestBuy and someone there could decide whether the repair would cost me or be free.  Not during state lockdown, thankyou - a mother needs it for her kid to do distance learning.  The chat agent entered a ticket on my computer to document the broken screen but of course left out the information i provided on how it became cracked and that it was fully functional. How nice?3) In April, my son opened the laptop up to start his schoolwork and the Google chrome page continually refreshed every 8 seconds.  There was no way to prevent this from happening as the touchscreen and mousepad would disable every 5 seconds of the 8, so we could do limited things in those 3 seconds we had control of it before it re-set. So I tried chat.  Big mistake.  Lenovo chat does allow you to specify that you need troubleshooting and technical service help, but the person I got said they don't do that online and to call someone.  I called the phone number.  Here is the ridiculousness that ensued:a) First lady says it's a software issue, not a hardware issue and my hardware is under warranty but software is not.  I need to upgrade and pay for software support so that she can troubleshoot the issue for me.  Pay?  Why? You have not asked me a single question to determine what could be going on. Though she reassure me repeatedly I have reached the right help center and can correct my problem, since I’m unwilling to blindly pay for her help for their product,  She says she can't help me but to call a different phone number where maybe someone can help me for free...?b) annoyed, I call the next phone number.  Might I mention each time I call this place so far their phone message immediately says they're having high call volume and to schedule a return phone call, but I humor them and wait this time.  The phone is answered within 2 minutes.  High call volume...or you want to avoid helping customers because you do not have one tech on staff who actually can do that?  The person who answered the phone asked for my name and phone number and then hangs up on me.c) I call another customer support number and the person who answers sounds vaguely like the first person I talked to but if it was she plays dumb after taking my name and computer serial number.  This woman tells me that the reason google chrome is refreshing itself every 8 seconds is A HA! because I have a cracked screen on the unit and it’s not a functional touchscreen any longer (are you some omnipotent being?)  and this Entire issue is surely due to the crack in the screen so she can't help me. No other questions asked by the way. I say that is absurd, I can use the touchscreen for several seconds without issue and it’s been fully functional for months.  She tells me to take it to a local place to have it serviced because she can't help me over the phone.  When I remind her that my state is in COVID-19 lockdown, she tells me that it's pronablu, definitely a Google issue and to CALL GOOGLE for support with their software!d) not that google would have helped rather than send me back to Lenovo, Google is closed due to COVID-19 and their contact through chat was impossible to find online as well.We ended up powerwashing the unit.  Fixed.  Why couldn't one of the 4 people I contacted with Lenovo run down a few scenarios with me and end up at the same conclusion as my 10 year old did?  DO NOT BUY FROM THIS ABSURD COMPANY IF YOU WANT A PRAYER OF SUPPORT FOR THEIR DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289
21,Matthew Stearns,"December 25, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for a tablet replacement for older parents,"For the price, it is a good buy. My father had an issue with using a regular laptop for streaming (he needed something with an HDMI cable to plug into his TV). The laptop I gave him was of good quality, but had an older hard drive (not SSD) so it would take awhile to boot up, and it wouldn’t run as fast as I would like. This is a simple chromebook that is just what I would consider a decent option, boots up quick, runs pretty fast, stream quality and screen is acceptable, and it comes with a full size HDMI port, on top of usb c which is what it uses to charge as well. I also created a new google account and logged it into my own computer so if he does need help, I can use googles remote access to help him remotely! I would recommend this for anyone who either needs a laptop for web browsing, a light workload such as document creation or online school, maybe a younger child’s first “real” computer. It is also pretty compact and light so I would recommend for traveling, however I can not speak to the durability, but it seemed stable. I would not recommend it for gaming unless it’s gaming on a tablet. I would also not advise anyone who’s in need of a lot of build in storage.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289
22,Steven H,"August 18, 2021",3.0 out of 5 stars,"If you had a Windows OS or Apple OS 2in1 touch laptop previously, expect a downgrade","So I have a love/hate relationship with this laptop. There's a bunch of pros and cons. Let's get to the pros first. Pros : Fires up instantly as soon as turned on and easy setup as soon you first get it. Takes less than 5 minuets to setup. Easy to navigate and download apps. If you already have google chrome setup on another device everything comes back just the way you had it. Really simplistic in design and is light weight and durable (it probably can handle a modest accident without breaking or the screen shattering). The screen does not wobble like some other 2in1's. Apps and other programs do not lag and fire up quickly. Now here is the dreaded cons. Cons: If you are not used to a Chromebook it is a super awkward OS! Nothing made complete sense to me about the OS from the start. I got used to it but it still is weird to me. The sound quality is subpar, it does not get loud enough for my taste either. The screen resolution is about as good as the original Kindle fire HD resolution circa 2012 - pretty much years behind to the current technology resolution. 64 gigs storage is simply not enough space to store music, pictures and movies, if you have google cloud that's your best bet to go about storage. This is not a gaming device, if you are into gaming the hardware can not support an intricate modern video game. The battery life is definetly not 9 hours! Maybe if you just left it on and did absolutely nothing with it, it can stay alive for that duration of time (on the flip side it does charge up fairly fast, about 1hr 30 mins). Lastly, it just does not have the feel of a laptop compared to Windows OS or Apple OS. I find myself getting frustrated with the way everything is setup on a Chrome OS.Overall not horrible, but not great. The reason I purchased this Lenovo was the price and wanted a touch screen computer to hold me over because my old HP touch 2in1 is all cracked and busted up. So I will use this one just for browsing the internet and other simplistic functions. Great for a kid to use and keep them occupied but as an adult it lacks functions that a real deal OS can provide. Expect a major downgrade if you go from Windows to this OS and just in general just a major downgrade. This would be state of the art if this was released in the early 10's(?). Hope this was insightful. 4/10 is my grade on this efficient yet awkward device.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289
23,Lenny,"March 13, 2020",5.0 out of 5 stars,What I expected and a little bit more,"When I write a review for a product I tried to be fair. First of all let me say that I have purchased an Acer 11 inch Chromebook and returned it last week because it was well terrible. I read a lot of reviews on the Lenovo, watch a lot of YouTube videos and I was fairly confident that I would be happy. I have to say I was not disappointed. The device shipped in typical Lenovo fashion and not too fancy packaging power cord small little booklet actually a pamphlet and the device itself. First things first the bad. There's not much bad to say about this device if you expected to be a gaming machine you will be disappointed it's a Chromebook. The display is IPS although it's slightly washed out the colors but sharp enough. The main drawback is the lack of ports there is one USB 3.1 and of course the USBC that is used for the power cord. You could use adapter and have 2 USB ports but this was she would be much better suited at least in my mind if it had at least two USB ports. Secondly the SD card, full size by the way sticks out way past the form factor making it not really a good way to store data. Unfortunately it doesn't go all the way in the body and it should. And last is it's White blizzard white is the only at color it comes in I don't know what's up with that. Now for the good and there's lots of goodness here. The quad-core mediatek processor is fast, at least fast in terms of what a Chromebook is. The touchscreen highly responsive the touchpad does not feel cheap and works really well although full disclosure I like to use a mouse. The case itself is made of plastic but it feels solid is no bending just a really nice quality filled to the tablet / Chromebook. Nice a tablet / Chromebook because it really is a Chromebook or laptop it doesn't work real well as a tablet it's a little big keyboard is on the other side but it works real good in tent mode that's for sure.  Bottom line I will be keeping this this makes the perfect little laptop to carry with me","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289
24,JEL,"February 27, 2019",4.0 out of 5 stars,My wife likes it..,"We really like the wide viewing angle good sound system . Younger people may not appreciate that as much as we do because our hearing & sight is not as good as it was many years ago,  Resolution could be better but for the most part is easy to see and hear.My wife has been using the C330 almost exclusively after we purchased it. There are several android apps that do not work well but the android apps she needs these days do work OK and that is all that is important for now. She did not like using the GMAIL app, so we turned on the linux option and installed the linux version Thunderbird mail .  Thunderbird mail  takes a little longer to start up than the other apps but seems to work very well. This is an ARM device so many of the applications that work on the Raspberry Pi etc will work on this device. Once installed the program icons can be placed on the shelf to be started as any other app..There is/was a learning curve as the Chomebook does not have all the settings where  android devices normally keep the same settings.It appeared you must keep it in developer mode to run apps from unknown sources making it less desirable for us to access the Amazon App store. Switching to and from developer mode requires a complete reset, but as soon as you log in to Google your settings and apps are restored. It takes a few minutes, so it is not something you want to do often.In tent mode the Lenovo Chomebook is nicer than using the Samsung 8.1 tablet on a stand.  We used a wireless mouse at first but found it easier to just use the touch screen.  However the touch screen does not work as good as the regular android devices we  own.  We did play with the ""text"" mode where you write on the screen and it adds it to your document, fun but not for us.Overall, we are happy with the purchase, we did not want to spend a lot of money for a high priced quality Chromebook until we knew we would actually like using it.  As others have noted, this Chrome box is pretty nice, for the most part easy to use and probably more secure than most regular laptops.  Google's Chrome OS is getting better but in it's current state of development it is good enough for us to use every day.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289
25,MR X,"July 21, 2019",4.0 out of 5 stars,This is an initial review from a first time Chromebook user and subject to re-review.,"My first impression is how did I ever do without it. I am a longtime computer user starting with a ""Sinclair"" that used a cassette  recorder for a hard drive . Then the Commodore  64 came out  and I had one of them. Eventually got a Desktop with Windows 3.1  then Windows got fancier every time , the last one I really liked was XP. I also had a IBM mainframe that came complete with all the huge disk drives  and a 6 ' wide printer and all the operating manuals and took a 16 ' box truck to move. Then Microsoft changed to Windows 7 , liked it OK but it got worse and worse with updates and then the notice about  quitting support and get Windows 10 or else! Well for me its else! I have tried Win 10  and absolutely hated it. Good bye Microsoft!I read all the reviews on every brand of Chromebook that I could afford being a disabled Vet. I decided on this Lenovo C-330. Ordered it on 7/16/2019 and got it the next day. Had no trouble whatsoever with setup , I followed the setup guide  and figured it would take hours to charge the battery and then do the setup. I let it charge for about 30 minutes and then decided  to take a look. I  was surprised that ir was fully charged and in seconds it had booted up, updated its self and all my stuff was available from my old computer. The only thing that didn't meet the description was that the spec's said it had a Micro SD card slot and this one has a full size slot. Sure it has a small keyboard but I can only use 2 fingers anyway and  use a mouse to browse with and the touch screen to read books so its no hardship to me. All in all  if you are a fence sitter like me don't wait any longer and buy your self a Chromebook !The only thing this machine needs is more USB ports (I have a port on order)  and make sure to print out the PDF  user guide on Amazon since the enclosed one with the machine is  one page folded 2 ways and the PDF is 20 + pages.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289
26,Anthony,"August 18, 2020",1.0 out of 5 stars,Horrible costumer service.,"I bought this product less than a month ago for my son’s online schooling.At first it worked perfectly. Great computer. Loved it. Then it stopped charging. Which I was bummed about but understand that things happen. I knew I had purchased the warranty and I am still within the 30 day Amazon warranty so I thought this would be an easy process to get a replacement.Boy, was I wrong!I spent 2 HOURS being passed back and forth between the Warranty company and Amazon.  Amazon offered a replacement but said I needed to file a claim with the extended warranty company. When I spoke with the warranty company they said that Amazon would need to replace the computer because it was still within the initial 30 days, understandably.After speaking to an initial amazon rep who was unable to help me and kept asking me if I’ve tried plugging it in in another outlet, I asked to speak with a supervisor and was transferred to Mary.Mary offered the worst costumer service I have EVER received from Amazon. Mary proceeded to tell me to “wait until I get to 30 days, then file a claim with the warranty company.” I expressed that I already spoken with the warranty company and they already knew of the situation and that they said that amazon needed to replace the computer. Mary kept repeating the same information saying that after 30 days the warranty company would cover it. I told her again that would not wait until the 30 days and that my concern was that the warranty company would not cover it because they had already been informed there was an issue with the laptop prior to the 30 days. Mary then proceeded to make a 3 way call to the warranty company and was told exactly what I told her by the warranty company. The warranty rep literally told Mary “this is not the costumers fault, please take care of the costumer and replace it.”When we hung up with the warranty company Mary continued to give me the same information over and over again.I told Mary (while she was talking) that I was very frustrated and that I didn’t understand why she continued to repeat herself she said “can I talk?” I was shocked that a supervisor felt that was appropriate! When I asked to speak with another supervisor or her supervisor she told me “I am the last point of contact.” 🤣 So apparently Mary runs Amazon, guys. She’s the last one we can speak with.To be clear Amazon offered me these options:Replacement  through the warranty company, but the warranty company wouldn’t replace it and Amazon didn’t have it “in stock.”$60 dollars for “repair costs” when I asked if I could repair the computer. My son is using it for school so we don’t have the option of not having a computer. But when I asked what that would do to my warranty Mary could not answer so I declined because $60. Not to mention that would not cover a repair.Then they offered a full refund, which I ended up taking and agree a refund is fair. One note about the return is that Mary wanted to schedule a UPS pick up for tomorrow to return the computer but my refund would not be in my account for 5-7 business days. I made it very clear that because of the confusion and lack of helpfulness I will not be sending the computer back until my full refund is in my bank account. I can only image the nightmare I would experience should I not get my refund and I’ve already returned the product.My main complaint is the costumer service from Amazon. It was HORRIBLE. To be passed around for 2 hours only to end up on the phone with the rudest “supervisor” (Mary) was mind boggling. It was very obvious that she couldn’t care less about my situation or helping me. Then for her to tell me that she is the “last point of contact” was frustrating and inappropriate.... but also quite comical. You are not the running the show for Amazon, Mary. I think somebody needs to clarify your position, sister. You are clearly confused. Some ( and by some I mean A LOT) of management & customer service training would be highly recommend for Ms. Mary. Her performance is screaming for help.Amazon has been easy to deal with in the past. It’s unfortunate that this is the treatment I received on an item that is a necessity in our household right now and was a pretty pricey purchase.The warranty company was easy to deal with and very polite.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289

Like many, my income has been cut so was looking for something that would ""do the job"" inexpensively. Got a great deal on this device and based on reviews and previous experience with Lenovo I took a chance. Could not have been happier for the past 3 weeks since receiving it.  (well, it doesn't run the NEWEST OS version, so I guess I could be a LITTLE happier, but this works great).  Then last night I needed to plug it in and recharge (this thing will go forever on a full charge by the way - I was seriously impressed).  At first it said that it wouldn't charge while turned on since it was a lower voltage charging device - but this was the Lenovo charger that it shipped with. Then it stopped charging altogether. I've tried different wall outlets, even switched the cable that plugs from the converter part to the wall - no luck. Was able to recharge it overnight plugging it from a standard usb-c into a wall adapter with it off, but unfortunately as of this morning the OEM power supply is junk.  and now I have just a few days to decide whether or not to return this for refund or try to pick up a new power supply somewhere.  As I still need this for work I'll probably have to do the latter, but I hate to have to sink money into it already less than a month in use. Other than that though - the device itself is awesome.  And well worth the additional money I did already spend picking up a hardshell case and keyboard cover to protect it.

32,The Engineer,"April 10, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Confessions Of An Orthodox Laptop User,"When they first came out, I was a strong critic of Chromebooks.  To me, a Chromebook was nothing more than an ADM-3A incarnate; connected to the cloud, instead of a mainframe.  But as Chromebooks started adding Chrome OS, Android and now Linux; I decided that I should get one, to carry around with me on trips; that did not require me to have access to a Windows Pro system.The hardest decision I had to make about this particular purchase, was if I should get the 64gb ""Amazon's Choice"" unit that was actually being sold by Lenovo; or a more expensive 32gb unit sold by other sellers, because their product titles included the words ""Newest 2019.""  Rest assured, when my 64gb unit arrived, the ""Manufactured"" date on the box was only 2 weeks old.While you are waiting for your order to arrive; it helps to pre-create a Google account, just for the Chromebook.  You can setup & customize a Chrome profile exclusively for use by the Chromebook; and then ""Add"" your other Google accounts to that Chrome profile.  This will speed things up when your Chromebook arrives, because you can just log into that Google account & Chrome profile; and your Chromebook is ready to go.  The advantage of this, besides setup speed, is that you won't clutter your Chromebook's login screen with more than one account choice.Be sure to update your version of Chrome OS.  As of the late March 2019 manufacturing run, version 70 comes installed.  You need at least version 72, if you expect to run Linux, from the get-go.For right now, the only thing that really surprised me about the unit, which may or may not be a ""standard Chromebook thing,"" is that I have (until now) never seen a physical keyboard that was labeled with lower case letters on it!  Speaking of the keyboard, for those who are wondering, the keyboard is disabled after the hinge goes beyond 180 degrees.  It does feel ""weird"" however, to feel the keyboard pressing against your fingers or lap, when using the Chromebook in tablet mode.********** 2019-04-27 Update **********Because the display side of the clamshell is so lightweight; when used in ""laptop mode,"" it is very sensitive to motion transfer, and may show signs of noticeable vibration.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289

34,Theo,"November 5, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Old OS version, wifi issues","This is my 4th chromebook, this one came with chromebook version 80.0.3987.137 after power up, it stated connected to wifi, but at the same time it stated not connected.Apparently this was a common flaw in that version, which was the version from spring 2020.I managed to connect as a guest on my wifi extender, and even though the signal was weak, updated to the current OS,  94.0.4606.114, this update took 8 hour.Now it seems to be running ok,  but honestly,  tweaking a new out of the box chromebook overnight just to get it running is a bit over the top.Google ""wifi won't connect but internet available on chromebook"",  lots of hits, so a heads up would have been nice, I was close to returning this thing.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289
35,John Lovinggood,"October 15, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great price for Good Project,"Easy setup. Bought it for my 8...soon turning 9 year old daughter so she could stop scaring my wife by using her MAC Book. :-) Main purpose is for research and to do assignments that are assigned from school from time to time. Battery life so far has lasted 2 days and is at 70%. We monitor her usage and do NOT let her have too much screen time.I'd recommend for an entry level laptop for those who do not want to spend a lot of money. Its light weight...portable and this one is pretty sleek looking. We can manage app usage and parental controls which is nice as well.This is a review that is two days into using the product. Will provide an update in a few months of constant usage etc.,","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289

37,Amber,"November 14, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, but might occasionally overheat and shut off.","My old Chromebook was having a hard time charging- charger kept wiggling or moving out of the slot, I had to hold it in place to charge, and when it was charging the metal would get really hot. I knew I needed a replacement before it completely died. This product is great - similar to the one I had, but obviously new and has a lot of life in it. The only issue I've noticed is that it can be a bit slow at times and if it is struggling the whole system will shut off and restart. I've only had it a few days so I need to work on figuring out how to get it to stop that. Otherwise, it's wonderful.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289
38,Glenn Orton,"February 6, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,Very useful for my purposes.,"I wanted this product to search for scientific articles and storing them on a flash drive to be accessed at a later time. The product works well (I'm not interested in gaming), but I wish it had more than one external connection port that would allow me to transport files from one medium to another immediately. Otherwise, everything works well.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289
39,Kathryn G,"May 14, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Better than my HP. Solid, beautiful Chromebook.","I'm new to Chromebooks but not new to computers. I am an old soul who learned DOS and so I'm most happy with something like Linux and therefore the Chrome OS being based off Linux and the ability for newer Chromebooks to run Linux and open source programs like LIbreOffice are extremely important to me. I recently spilled a whole glass of wine right onto my HP Chromebook 14 therefore I had to buy a new one (even after taking the laptop apart to dry it out). This Lenovo is beautiful. The quality is far greater than the HP piles of junk out there. The screen is magnificent for such a cheap little thing. I like the fact I can use my Logitech Blutooth keyboard and therefore hopefully never spill anything again. That's the beauty of Chromebooks though - everything was backed up online and I didn't really lose much. Picked up where i left off with this wickedly good Lenovo. I have used a lot of machines - including Macs and Dell. I don't feel the price for those things are justified in anyway unless you are a full time graphics dev or designer and need heavy overpriced programs like Photoshop. There are superb alternatives with open source. Inkscape, GIMP, Scribus...and more. Cheap Chromebooks can't do everything but they are getting better all the time. I highly suggest updating Chrome when you buy this laptop, restart it then open settings and turn on Linux Beta. Learn about the programs you can run and how intelligent Linux is at installing them.Overall I love the size of this Chromebook. The screen is clear and gorgeous. Resolution is wonderful. Wish the laptop had more than one standard USB port but I'll manage. (I back up all locally kept files onto a USB drive or sometimes Google Drive). Touchpad seems responsive. The ability to use the laptop as a computer or tablet is fluid and no complaints. Solid build and it looks overall like something way more expensive yet my bank account or credit card isn't bloated because there is a fruit logo on this thing. Very happy with this purchase, would consider buying another one.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289
