1,Amazon Customer,"March 17, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent for the price.,"For context: the laptop I had prior to this was a $200 HP that couldn't run more than 3 tabs of Chrome at once, so anything was going to be an improvement.The features I mainly use my laptop for are:-work (spreadsheets, Chrome tabs, designs on Canva, InDesign, etc.)-art (making pixel art in Photoshop and Aseprite)-gaming (Night in the Woods, Stardew Valley, Among Us, etc. The heaviest game I've run is Sims 3.)-meetings (Google Meet & Zoom)-writing (short stories & fiction)Immediately this laptop was a massive improvement. The keyboard is SO pleasant. It's backlit blue, which you can turn on and off. It has a numpad which is great if you work with spreadsheets/data. The responsiveness of the keys is satisfying. The touchpad has a good click, though it has no buttons (I like this, but others may not).Laptop runs beautifully. Startup is fast, runs multiple pages of Chrome no problem, and even loads up Adobe Creative Cloud as quickly as the desktop I have at work. If you want more speed, the 8GB RAM is upgradeable according to other reviewers. I'm considering it, but right now I have no need.The screen is matte and does a good job of reducing glare - not to mention the size is great for gaming, and the display, while a tiny bit muted, works just fine for the type of graphic design and pixel art I do.This is a gaming laptop, and the games I've run so far are so smooth and so easy to play. I have no input lag and I can run them on the highest graphics settings. To be fair, I don't play more intensive games, so I can't speak to that. But lighter games run smoothly and very well.My only 3 complaints about this laptop I have so far (I've had it about 2 weeks) are: the weight, the fan noise, and the battery. It's a little bit heavier than I'm used to carrying, but if you have it in a protective sleeve in a backpack, I doubt it'll be much of an issue. Just be prepared for thickness and a little bit of heftiness. The fan noise is my biggest problem. I was on a Google Meet call yesterday and within a couple of minutes, the fan kicked on and was pretty loud. It hardly ever runs, but the laptop does feel warm after a bit of use. I wouldn't recommend using this laptop in bed or anywhere it can't get good ventilation. And lastly, the battery life is a little bit shorter than I'd like it to be. It lasts a couple of hours, which is good, but be prepared to keep your charger with you if you're taking it outside your home.If you're like me, even budget laptops (below $1000) don't feel very ""budget."" Anything that costs more than $500 has me pretty hesitant. Rest assured, I've looked at laptops for probably eight months before committing to this one. So far, it's been worth the investment, and if you want a computer that can handle a number of tasks without lag or sluggishness, I'd highly recommend the Lenovo L340.",Lenovo - IdeaPad L340 15 Gaming Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 - 256GB Solid State Drive - Black,&639
2,Honey,"June 2, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Speakers are SUPER quiet!!,"I’ve had this laptop for a few months now and I love it. This is a relatively cheap laptop as far as gaming laptops go and it works pretty well with really nice graphics.The only annoying thing about it is how quiet the speakers are. It’s really hard to hear it over anything; if my air conditioner is on I can’t hear the laptop most of the time.I have a separate speaker but I don’t always want to have to connect it if I’m laying in bed playing or watching something. If you don’t have a speaker you can connect, you should get one if you’re getting this laptop!!",Lenovo - IdeaPad L340 15 Gaming Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 - 256GB Solid State Drive - Black,&639

We ordered up a pair of these to play games like Conan Exiles, State of Decay 2, and other more casual less demanding games. Even on Conan set to high i still get 50-60fps averaging around 52. For that game, I can't complain at all. As long as you have it on a cooler mat it stays pretty cool considering it's all enclosed. I run mine in clamshell mode with a 27inch scepter monitor.

5,Amazon Customer,"December 5, 2020",5.0 out of 5 stars,No better deal for the price,"I bought this for gaming, it runs red dead redemption 2 and Grounded on high settings flawlessly. I recommend setting your max processor state to 85% which will prevent any and all throttling or overheating issues as well as give your cpu a longer lifespan. Speakers are decent and quite loud, the weight and size are comparable to any other laptop meaning it doesn't stand out like other gaming laptops at all. When I'm not gaming on it, the fans are  quiet. But they are as loud as any other laptop when gaming unfortunately, nothing that can be done about it and not the sellers fault. The fan intake is on the bottom,which would make cooling pads more effective but trust me they won't be needed at 85% processor state.

24,Lisa Perales,"March 20, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great laptop!," I bought this gaming laptop for my sister through this listing, which was shipped by Valinor Tech. A short time after she started to notice a glitch (see video)  that would happen with the screen. A part of the top left section would seem distorted until the mouse was dragged over the area. I returned the defective product for a full refund within the allotted time I'm allowed to do so. However,  Valinor Tech still took out over $100 from the refund for a 'restocking fee'. It makes no sense that I have to pay the price for a defective product, and when I disputed the claim, Valinor Tech said these types of errors have to be reported within the first 14 days, and I took too long, which is stupid and infuriating even though I returned it in time. They also said that they checked it and they did not see a glitch. So now it's my word against theirs even though there is a video to prove it.So thanks for nothing Valinor Tech. Next time, make sure your products break faster so people can get the refund they deserve.",Lenovo - IdeaPad L340 15 Gaming Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 - 256GB Solid State Drive - Black,&639

48,Chandler Metcaffe,"March 7, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Horrible battery.,"Great laptop for the price. Can play all modern games well enough. Battery sucks bad. Isn’t at 100% charge if you leave it plugged into the power block for week. Down to 97% at full charge. If you let the battery almost run out and then charge it, it goes back up to 100%. Battery doesn’t last long at all.",Lenovo - IdeaPad L340 15 Gaming Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 - 256GB Solid State Drive - Black,&639
49,Matthew W,"March 20, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good value but get bigger hdd,I've only had it for 2 days and so far I love this laptop.  Plays the new Avengers game without a problem.  I would recommend getting the one with bigger hard disk drive because 256gb isn't enough and its a pain to get inside of it to out in a bigger HDD.,Lenovo - IdeaPad L340 15 Gaming Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 - 256GB Solid State Drive - Black,&639
