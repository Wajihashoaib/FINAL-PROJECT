10,Ms5feet9,"August 14, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Don't come to this model looking to use an effective camera or microphone.,"I purchased this so I wouldn't have to keep lugging my district-issued laptop back and forth to my campus.  I only use the camera for zoom meetings.  This is the WORST quality in a camera I've ever (not) seen.  It shows very grainy and dark outside of zoom.  But in zoom meetings, it gives 100% retro!  And apparently using the microphone also gives some type of feedback to your zoom listeners.  No problems detected with the speakers thus far, however.","Lenovo IdeaPad 1 Laptop, 14.0"" HD Display, Intel Celeron N4020, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Intel UHD Graphics 600, Windows 11 in S Mode, Ice Blue",&261

13,MartyReads,"May 18, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Winner When you need just the basics -- without throwing it out like a Chromebook,"I was keeping an eye peeled for a decent little machine for a secondary from the fully loaded laptop we also have.  The price was nice and it had a better processor than any of the previous reviews I'd read and did NOT come with a Chromebook expiration date like most laptops in this price range.  I do not like ""throw away"" / disposable culture.  Great for web searching, NYT games, email and word processing. Also great for us when we want to connect bluetooth devices. The small size is a plus when you want to take on the go, or just carry to another spot.  Had no trouble setting up, came with virus protection and more.  It's actually a pretty nice deal with all that's included.  Would make a nice starter for a student as long as processor speed and memory are considered.","Lenovo IdeaPad 1 Laptop, 14.0"" HD Display, Intel Celeron N4020, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Intel UHD Graphics 600, Windows 11 in S Mode, Ice Blue",&261

I love being a writer with this because it’s so light and small and I can take it anywhere. I also can have as many tabs and applications open for when I’m working on multiple projects.
