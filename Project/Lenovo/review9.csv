1,Miriam M Howard,"March 3, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Not Worth The Price,"I bought this computer for my husband. I am familiar with Lenovo and although I prefer HP decided to give Lenovo another chance. I read the reviews before I bought it. I was satisfied that this computer would be good for my husband because he only uses it on a casual basis.Not having much experience with computers he thinks everything that happens is supposed to happen.I noticed that unless the computer is plugged into the power source, the screen is very dark. Another thing that I noticed is that the bottom of the computer gets very hot after a couple of hours.I wonder how long it will be before I have to replace it. I definitely don’t think it was worth the cost.","Lenovo - IdeaPad 1 14"" Laptop - AMD A6-Series - 4GB Memory - AMD Radeon R4 - 64GB eMMC Flash Memory - Platinum Gray - 81VS009GUS",&251
2,Amazon Customer,"February 12, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for lower school child,This laptop was a Christmas gift for my eleven year old granddaughter.  She has enjoyed using it.  Originally the S-mode made it impossible to add Zoom which her school uses for eLearning.  Recently she has been able to use it but it seems it can only be used on the browser and is somewhat glitchy and not as good as on an iPad.  This needs to be addressed as this is otherwise a good computer for a lower school student.,"Lenovo - IdeaPad 1 14"" Laptop - AMD A6-Series - 4GB Memory - AMD Radeon R4 - 64GB eMMC Flash Memory - Platinum Gray - 81VS009GUS",&251

6,X,"September 24, 2021",1.0 out of 5 stars,Too good to be true,"After my old laptop bit the dust, I went looking for reviews of a good, cheap laptop that works well for a student. This one had some pretty good reviews, and for less than $300, I thought this was the one. But I feel completely lied to by all the reviews that said this was a great budget laptop for students. Sure, I didn't expect a top quality performance, but I expected it to at least be able to open a webpage without completely freezing up. And forget being able to attend online classes with this thing, it can't last more than 5 minutes in a zoom session without freezing up and forcing you to close the app. So since this laptop can't even seem to do the most basic tasks for a student with online classes, I'll be returning it.","Lenovo - IdeaPad 1 14"" Laptop - AMD A6-Series - 4GB Memory - AMD Radeon R4 - 64GB eMMC Flash Memory - Platinum Gray - 81VS009GUS",&251

25,sailorbear510,"May 20, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,It's not bad but you need to know a few things.,"I bought this on Black Friday for a good price in 2020 and it's a great all around computer if you know what you're expecting. Unfortunately the laptop is plagued by performance issues when it gets too busy. Windows Updates are a majority of the laptops performance problems.When you update the computer all other functions slow to a crawl until they are complete. So if you want to make this laptop your primary device, I suggest setting up your Wifi connection as a metered connection and also doing the updates overnight as it's going to take a very long time to complete the updates.Also I defer updates for several weeks so this helps the laptops performance. Disabling the Windows Update service in Administrative Services (services.msc command in the search box) helps too.Now when it comes to gaming, sure, this laptop is not equipped to handle that by nature. But it can game on a reasonable level. I have run Serious Sam 1 and 2, Unreal Tournament 2004, Unreal II and some other 3D graphical games and it runs them fine with acceptable default settings.Of course you will want to purchase an external hard drive (make sure it's USB 3.0) in order to run the games as this computer only has a 64 gb SSD. You also can't upgrade to Windows 11 even though the laptop device manager says it has TPM 2.0 and I don't know why the graphics processor don't qualify this system to upgrade. Not willing to take the risk either to do an unsupported install either.Overall this is a nice little system if you know how to get around its technical issues but if you are not savvy with computer issues and so forth this may not be the one for you. Have owned it for 2 years and still working fine.","Lenovo - IdeaPad 1 14"" Laptop - AMD A6-Series - 4GB Memory - AMD Radeon R4 - 64GB eMMC Flash Memory - Platinum Gray - 81VS009GUS",&251

31,J. Foley,"November 27, 2020",1.0 out of 5 stars,"It is NOT Windows. It is Windows ""S"" meaning no NON Windows Apps like ZOOM.","From a REVIEW SITE.""Con: Security comes at the cost of usabilityThe resilience of Windows 10 S mode comes with several drawbacks.As mentioned above, you can only install apps from the Windows Store. That may not seem like a big deal at first (because surely the apps you need will be in the Windows Store), but there are a lot of things professional users need that are downloaded from the web or installed using other app management platforms.S mode means no Adobe software, no Apple apps, no non-Microsoft video conferencing apps, limited to no third-party security software--in short, if it comes to a Windows PC via a third party it doesn't come to S mode at all.That includes web browsers and that's a deal killer for many people. Windows 10 S mode users are stuck with Edge as their browser and Bing as their default search engine. To further restrict browsing matters, even if Chrome or Firefox were installed on an S mode computer it couldn't be set as the default browser, nor can the default search engine be changed.
