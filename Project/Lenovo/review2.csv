0,Brian,"July 19, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Laptop,"I have built my own computers since 1999.  I know what I want in them and how much it's gonna cost me.  I never buy the latest stuff, I keep it about a year old and has served me well.  But this time after a friend's advice I dove into the gamin laptop and am very pleased.  No it's not the legion 7 but it's new and has what I need.  Quick fire up, minimal bloat software, slapped in another 1 TB drive, created my local account, updated everything, loaded MW and I was off to the races.  Great machine.  I will be getting the 80 watt battery to give it the power boost it needs to really open it up.  Very happy.  We'll worth it and highly recommend.8/23Quick update.  This laptop is great.  I have the HDR setting turned on with no issues.  4k will only run at 60 fps but the picture is outstanding and doesn't really task the processor or vid card.  I recommend the RAM upgrade.  It comes with 16 gig of ddr4 and is actually the sweet spot for most everything but boosting to 32 gig of ddr4 really gives it a lot more breathing room to perform.I would get a stand or something for airflow.  I love AMD but they are a hot runner compared to Intel.  But this thing does have an awesome cooling system as long as you've got the bottom vents unobstructed.  Heat is the enemy.Windows 11 is actually a very good OS.  I found a cheap metal stand that works perfect.  I work in Engineering IT and have delt with every os since win 95 so seen the good and the bad.Just my 2 cents and hope it helps some folks","Lenovo - Legion 5 - Gaming Laptop - AMD Ryzen 7 5800H - 16GB RAM - 512GB Storage - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050Ti - 15.6"" FHD Display - Windows 11 Home - Phantom Blue",&1099
1,Grimmjow,"July 9, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Legion you are perfect to me <3,"This is my first gaming laptop! I’ve been looking for awhile for a good gaming laptop. I’ve looked through Razer, Asus, Gigabyte mostly the big brands then I saw this Lenovo Legion and I thought to myself why I’m I looking at those high end gaming laptops when it’s my first gaming laptop and Knowing that I would probably just toss it around and it’ll just get wreck in my backpack and stuff. So why not save some money. For a thousand bucks this exceeded my expectations, it runs triple A games flawlessly with no problems at all. It’s super fast out of the box. Only bloatware it came with was McCafé so I didn’t do much cleaning, it was ready game. I never paid attention to Lenovo before, didn’t know they make good gaming laptops but actually this laptop looks good, it doesn’t scream I’m a gamer, I can take it out in class and at the library without gaining much attention, Very stealth looking. It’s all plastic but the build feels solid. The fans are loud as always with any gaming laptops. The keyboard is soft, feels good to type on. The best thing is that the laptop is upgradable, the 2x RAM, 2x SSD, Wi-Fi and battery are easily accessible without voiding warranty, yes Lenovo allows those upgrades so don’t worry. The hybrid mode aka mux switch is good to have too. The screen looks good without even calibrating it. There are lots of air vents specially a huge vent under the laptop so very good cooling. If you’re on a budget student gamer well this is a good choice for you. For a thousand bucks you get an AMD Ryzen, RTX series, SSD, dual channel RAM, IPS fast monitor, Mux switch, windows 11, 3 months xbl ultimate sheesh can’t beat that.","Lenovo - Legion 5 - Gaming Laptop - AMD Ryzen 7 5800H - 16GB RAM - 512GB Storage - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050Ti - 15.6"" FHD Display - Windows 11 Home - Phantom Blue",&1099

I bought it to play some games, and they all run smooth (as long as it’s charging or has above 25% battery remaining) I’ve played; Resident Evil 4, Tomb Raider, Fortnite, Little Nightmares II, GTA SA, Minecraft, Geometry Dash, OSU mania, Friday Night Funkin mods, Heavy Roblox games, Psi Ops, all of them with max settings and no lag.And yeah, I know most of them aren’t really heavy games, but that’s what i use it for, and I’m happy with it and I think it can run anything I throw at it, my last computer couldn’t even open google HAHAHA, so yeah, this is great.It also looks very clean and nice, I mean, it has it’s gamer look, but it’s not too obvious like other options.Also, the computer is exactly as it’s advertised, no complains at all. I Recommend it if you want to play some light games on max settings, or heavy games on medium/low settings.

5,Bridget Partridge,"August 25, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Much faster than anticipated for gaming.,"I got this to use in my bedroom as a secondary gaming rig for the evening, what i didn't expect was that it would be so much better than my primary. I have a PC that isn't very old, with AM3+ 32gig/GTX1070 water cooled and i expected the laptop to be slightly below this in performance based on ratings, however the opposite is true. The laptop with ryzen far exceeds and in many cases double the FPS in many of the games i play on the same settings as my main rig. The 3050TI really shines with this processor, and the advanced sound controls really take it the rest of the way there. And the fans on this thing are impressive, it maintains low temps and you can feel the air really blasting out of the sides, and it's not nearly as loud as my main PC. Since then i have made a docking station to replace my main PC now with this, and i use it for pretty much everything. (I would heavily invest in a fan filter system if you have pets or you leave it running a lot as a docked pc)(I use the 1"" thick do it yourself AC system filter available at any hardware store, as a pad underneath)","Lenovo - Legion 5 - Gaming Laptop - AMD Ryzen 7 5800H - 16GB RAM - 512GB Storage - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050Ti - 15.6"" FHD Display - Windows 11 Home - Phantom Blue",&1099

9,Stratcat,"August 3, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Runs Linux Mint well,"I'm pretty impressed with this laptop and it's price. I'm a Linux user so the first thing I do with a new laptop is replace whatever it came with with my current fave flavor of Linux. I've been using Linux Mint for the past few years so I decided to stick with it. After the initial install, wifi wasn't working and it wouldn't always wake up from sleep. A quick upgrade to the latest kernel version fixed those issues and I've had no further problems since. I do occasional 3d modeling work and everything has been snappy and good with this guy. I do miss the 4k screen on my older Lenovo but this is fine. For a gaming laptop, it's not too heavy or bulky. I think they did a good job designing these models.","Lenovo - Legion 5 - Gaming Laptop - AMD Ryzen 7 5800H - 16GB RAM - 512GB Storage - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050Ti - 15.6"" FHD Display - Windows 11 Home - Phantom Blue",&1099

I have had no problems with anything else as far as operation goes.  I did, however, raise the back of the laptop up another 1/4"" with rubber stick on pads and it has seemed to have made the fan not have to run as often or as hard.

22,Syrus Sheely,"February 24, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Overall very good for price," This review is for the Lenovo Legion 5 Gaming Laptop, 15.6"" FHD Display, AMD Ryzen 7 5800H, 16GB RAM, 512GB Storage, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050Ti, Windows 11 Home, Phantom Blue.Everything is perfect and beautiful other than the dead pixel it came with.Pros:- Feels sturdy and durable.- Has a ton of port for I/O! Their positioning, amount and selection is way better than most of laptops nowadays.- The keyboard feels very comfortable and it looks beautiful with its 4 zone RGB backlighting.- The touchpad feels very soft and responsive.- The arrow keys are not cramped into the keyboard layout and take advantage of the extra space.- It does come with a webcam and a kill switch to fully disconnect it if needed.- The 165hz FHD IPS display is gorgeous.- The speakers sound very good, above average for a gaming laptop.- It has lots of ventilation to keep it as cool as possible under stress.- The lid design is much more subtle and professional than the Legion 5 Pro.- Minimum backlight bleed, almost none at all.Cons (See attached video for the ones related to the screen):- Not enough quality control, mine came with a dead pixel and found online that it is a common issue.- Just nitpicking here, but for my liking, ethernet port is upside down, always needs to lift the back of the laptop to unplug as the lock pin is at the bottom.- Power brick (A/C Adaptor) is quite big and heavy.- Has some backlight bleed.Mine was sealed and never opened, that's why I'm pretty sure it is an assembly line defect, however, I decided to keep it as I don't want to run the risk of receiving a replacement unit with more impactful flaws, and also I don't want to be going back and forth returning a bunch of units until I get a 100% perfect one.I would've given this 5 stars and great recommendation if it didn't come with a dead pixel, but I can't because it makes my eyes itch whenever I notice that it's not dust, but I'll cope by using dark mode everywhere I can.Other than that, for $1,030, if you do get a perfect unit, this is an exceptional deal.","Lenovo - Legion 5 - Gaming Laptop - AMD Ryzen 7 5800H - 16GB RAM - 512GB Storage - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050Ti - 15.6"" FHD Display - Windows 11 Home - Phantom Blue",&1099

24,Sebastian Cintron,"May 22, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,,"I had been looking at this specific computer for a while and was going to buy it directly from Lenovo since the price matched the one here on Amazon. But that was the base model with a worse graphics card, screen, refresh rate, ext. I don’t remember well anymore because I got it almost two months ago but there was 5 or 6 higher end features that would have cost nearly $2000 if I had gotten it directly from Lenovo. The battery life is poor and it can’t go more than two hours of use without being plugged in, and in video games it performs significantly worse unplugged than plugged in. But putting that annoyance aside the machine works great and is a beast at running games. I’ve yet to get a game that it wouldn’t run over 60fps and it runs warzone on max graphics at around 115-125 frames. I’m not being paid to say this so you can trust my review if you’ve read this far.

When I called Amazon to get the difference refunded, they refused and said I have to return it and re-purchase it and that the fund will be back on my card in 5-7 days. It makes no sense why a business like Amazon would rather lose my sale entirely but you bet I will be returning this and not repurchasing it through amazon. You can thank your customer service rep I spoke to for not understanding how businesses and loyalty works.The other reason why I am returning it is that while the laptop is decent. It has issues. The RGB lights are a bit annoying as it is not smooth in its transition and actually an eye sore in my opinion. I also noticed the laptop cannot game properly if its not constantly connected to the power source so do not expect it to be mobile as intended. It has to remain plugged to keep up with frame rates at all times or expect lag. Also its not a touchscreen or mine doesn't work so I don't know why that option is even there for review.Overall, decent laptop. Poor customer service through Amazon. Maybe buy a similar model off Best Buy who treats customers better.","Lenovo - Legion 5 - Gaming Laptop - AMD Ryzen 7 5800H - 16GB RAM - 512GB Storage - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050Ti - 15.6"" FHD Display - Windows 11 Home - Phantom Blue",&1099

You have to plug it into the back of the laptop, not the side.","Lenovo - Legion 5 - Gaming Laptop - AMD Ryzen 7 5800H - 16GB RAM - 512GB Storage - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050Ti - 15.6"" FHD Display - Windows 11 Home - Phantom Blue",&1099

40,Brian,"July 19, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Laptop,"I have built my own computers since 1999.  I know what I want in them and how much it's gonna cost me.  I never buy the latest stuff, I keep it about a year old and has served me well.  But this time after a friend's advice I dove into the gamin laptop and am very pleased.  No it's not the legion 7 but it's new and has what I need.  Quick fire up, minimal bloat software, slapped in another 1 TB drive, created my local account, updated everything, loaded MW and I was off to the races.  Great machine.  I will be getting the 80 watt battery to give it the power boost it needs to really open it up.  Very happy.  We'll worth it and highly recommend.8/23Quick update.  This laptop is great.  I have the HDR setting turned on with no issues.  4k will only run at 60 fps but the picture is outstanding and doesn't really task the processor or vid card.  I recommend the RAM upgrade.  It comes with 16 gig of ddr4 and is actually the sweet spot for most everything but boosting to 32 gig of ddr4 really gives it a lot more breathing room to perform.I would get a stand or something for airflow.  I love AMD but they are a hot runner compared to Intel.  But this thing does have an awesome cooling system as long as you've got the bottom vents unobstructed.  Heat is the enemy.Windows 11 is actually a very good OS.  I found a cheap metal stand that works perfect.  I work in Engineering IT and have delt with every os since win 95 so seen the good and the bad.Just my 2 cents and hope it helps some folks","Lenovo - Legion 5 - Gaming Laptop - AMD Ryzen 7 5800H - 16GB RAM - 512GB Storage - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050Ti - 15.6"" FHD Display - Windows 11 Home - Phantom Blue",&1099
41,Grimmjow,"July 9, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Legion you are perfect to me <3,"This is my first gaming laptop! I’ve been looking for awhile for a good gaming laptop. I’ve looked through Razer, Asus, Gigabyte mostly the big brands then I saw this Lenovo Legion and I thought to myself why I’m I looking at those high end gaming laptops when it’s my first gaming laptop and Knowing that I would probably just toss it around and it’ll just get wreck in my backpack and stuff. So why not save some money. For a thousand bucks this exceeded my expectations, it runs triple A games flawlessly with no problems at all. It’s super fast out of the box. Only bloatware it came with was McCafé so I didn’t do much cleaning, it was ready game. I never paid attention to Lenovo before, didn’t know they make good gaming laptops but actually this laptop looks good, it doesn’t scream I’m a gamer, I can take it out in class and at the library without gaining much attention, Very stealth looking. It’s all plastic but the build feels solid. The fans are loud as always with any gaming laptops. The keyboard is soft, feels good to type on. The best thing is that the laptop is upgradable, the 2x RAM, 2x SSD, Wi-Fi and battery are easily accessible without voiding warranty, yes Lenovo allows those upgrades so don’t worry. The hybrid mode aka mux switch is good to have too. The screen looks good without even calibrating it. There are lots of air vents specially a huge vent under the laptop so very good cooling. If you’re on a budget student gamer well this is a good choice for you. For a thousand bucks you get an AMD Ryzen, RTX series, SSD, dual channel RAM, IPS fast monitor, Mux switch, windows 11, 3 months xbl ultimate sheesh can’t beat that.","Lenovo - Legion 5 - Gaming Laptop - AMD Ryzen 7 5800H - 16GB RAM - 512GB Storage - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050Ti - 15.6"" FHD Display - Windows 11 Home - Phantom Blue",&1099
42,Jason,"June 30, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for gaming,"This computer is just great. I bought it to play some games, and they all run smooth (as long as it’s charging or has above 25% battery remaining) I’ve played; Resident Evil 4, Tomb Raider, Fortnite, Little Nightmares II, GTA SA, Minecraft, Geometry Dash, OSU mania, Friday Night Funkin mods, Heavy Roblox games, Psi Ops, all of them with max settings and no lag.And yeah, I know most of them aren’t really heavy games, but that’s what i use it for, and I’m happy with it and I think it can run anything I throw at it, my last computer couldn’t even open google HAHAHA, so yeah, this is great.It also looks very clean and nice, I mean, it has it’s gamer look, but it’s not too obvious like other options.Also, the computer is exactly as it’s advertised, no complains at all. I Recommend it if you want to play some light games on max settings, or heavy games on medium/low settings. It just depends, but for what I do, this is fantastic","Lenovo - Legion 5 - Gaming Laptop - AMD Ryzen 7 5800H - 16GB RAM - 512GB Storage - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050Ti - 15.6"" FHD Display - Windows 11 Home - Phantom Blue",&1099

Lo que decidí hacer por la oportunidad que tenía fue pedir el artículo a casa de un familiar que vive en Estados Unidos y posteriormente éste familiar me lo envió a la Ciudad de México, no sé si ésto haya ayudado en realidad a recibir el objeto adecuado.Finalmente, aún así me salió barata comparando con su precio en México.","Lenovo - Legion 5 - Gaming Laptop - AMD Ryzen 7 5800H - 16GB RAM - 512GB Storage - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050Ti - 15.6"" FHD Display - Windows 11 Home - Phantom Blue",&1099

45,Bridget Partridge,"August 25, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Much faster than anticipated for gaming.,"I got this to use in my bedroom as a secondary gaming rig for the evening, what i didn't expect was that it would be so much better than my primary. I have a PC that isn't very old, with AM3+ 32gig/GTX1070 water cooled and i expected the laptop to be slightly below this in performance based on ratings, however the opposite is true. The laptop with ryzen far exceeds and in many cases double the FPS in many of the games i play on the same settings as my main rig. The 3050TI really shines with this processor, and the advanced sound controls really take it the rest of the way there. And the fans on this thing are impressive, it maintains low temps and you can feel the air really blasting out of the sides, and it's not nearly as loud as my main PC. Since then i have made a docking station to replace my main PC now with this, and i use it for pretty much everything. (I would heavily invest in a fan filter system if you have pets or you leave it running a lot as a docked pc)(I use the 1"" thick do it yourself AC system filter available at any hardware store, as a pad underneath)","Lenovo - Legion 5 - Gaming Laptop - AMD Ryzen 7 5800H - 16GB RAM - 512GB Storage - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050Ti - 15.6"" FHD Display - Windows 11 Home - Phantom Blue",&1099

49,Stratcat,"August 3, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Runs Linux Mint well,"I'm pretty impressed with this laptop and it's price. I'm a Linux user so the first thing I do with a new laptop is replace whatever it came with with my current fave flavor of Linux. I've been using Linux Mint for the past few years so I decided to stick with it. After the initial install, wifi wasn't working and it wouldn't always wake up from sleep. A quick upgrade to the latest kernel version fixed those issues and I've had no further problems since. I do occasional 3d modeling work and everything has been snappy and good with this guy. I do miss the 4k screen on my older Lenovo but this is fine. For a gaming laptop, it's not too heavy or bulky. I think they did a good job designing these models.","Lenovo - Legion 5 - Gaming Laptop - AMD Ryzen 7 5800H - 16GB RAM - 512GB Storage - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050Ti - 15.6"" FHD Display - Windows 11 Home - Phantom Blue",&1099
