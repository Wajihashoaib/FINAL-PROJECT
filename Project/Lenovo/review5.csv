2,Lewguitar,"April 16, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,I like the laptop a lot.  I dislike the blue hue the screen gives to all images.,"The computer itself works fine and does everything I want it to.  I like it very much.  It actually seems to function a little faster and easier than my Lenovo Yoga.  But I like the screen of my Yoga much more.  The screen of the Ideapad 3 adds a light blue hue to everything, especially photos.  This throws the colors off.  It also feels ""depressing"" - it affects my mood.  There are ways to change the display to cooler shades or warmer shades but to my eyes, the options look worse than the factory color tones.  Maybe this can be corrected, but my Lenovo Yoga looked great right out of the box.  This Lenovo Ideapad3 does not.  I think some of the problem has to do with the angle the screen is opened to.  The image fades or deepens, deepening upon the angle you are viewing the screen from.  My Yoga is not this sensitive, and the screen has a sharper image.  That's my only complaint.  The colors of the screen don't look as vivid or sharp or accurate, as they do on my Lenovo Yoga.","Lenovo IdeaPad 3 Laptop, 15.6"" HD Touchscreen, 11th Gen Intel Core i3-1115G4 Processor, 20GB DDR4 RAM, 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD, HDMI, Webcam, Wi-Fi 5, Bluetooth, Windows 11 Home, Almond",&600

The computer is fast and capable of utilizing all of the software needed for my day to day work and internet streaming is pretty instant when it comes to loading. The main negatives I have are in regards to the hardware. The power cable is short and the part with that plugs into the outlet is a bulky brick that falls of easily due to the weight. Also, the brightness when plugged in is significantly brighter than when it is not plugged in. I tried to override the display settings so that it is just as bright when it is unplugged but it will not let me do it in the simple commands menu.
