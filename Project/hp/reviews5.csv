0,SmartOne,"August 25, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good for small business use,"I bought this for my private practice and it works great. Does not have a bunch of bell and whistles but it meets my needs since this is what I leave at the office. Analogue:  Better than a flip phone or Google phone but it's not a new  iPhone. I am very happy with it. It runs faster than I expected, which was my biggest concern.","HP 15.6-inch Laptop, 11th Generation Intel Core i5-1135G7, Intel Iris Xe Graphics, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, Windows 11 Home (15-dy2024nr, Natural silver)",$519.00
1,Lucille Seden,"August 2, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Laptop is working well.,"I use this HP Laptop for personal use as well as for my Prayer Group duties. I maintain membership lists as well as other related lists. I create ads for our events and send them via email to our rectory for insertion in the church's bulletin. Our other HP Laptop has been in use for these purposes since 2016. Since my husband has been using the other laptop more frequently, (writing novels), I decided to get one for myself. This way I have access whenever I want it. I fully expect this Laptop to serve me as well as the older one did.","HP 15.6-inch Laptop, 11th Generation Intel Core i5-1135G7, Intel Iris Xe Graphics, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, Windows 11 Home (15-dy2024nr, Natural silver)",$519.00
2,Lance M.,"July 23, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good midrange laptop!,I bought this on a Amazon treasure truck 🚛 deal. I read many reviews before the purchase and many complain of issues connecting to wireless. I have had no such issues nor any other issues. Matter of fact this is the best PC I have ever used personally. I find I never have to wait on it to do anything. It boots up faster than any previous PC I've had. Now it only comes with a free trial of anti virus software so I simply use avast one free edition but you also have the option to use windows defender at no charge at it has improved alot over the years not as good as avast but almost.

I believe that the ""bloatware"" was interfering with it.  I say this because I updated windows  several times to no avail.  It does work fine now. The swiching of the wifi driver to disable letting windows decide when to optimize battery usage DID NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM.  The battery does charge quickly but it does not last super long (may explain in part the quick charging).

8,laphamazon,"May 18, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,"...that pesky known issue of ""no WI-FI""...","I read the reviews here before I purchased this laptop 8 days ago, including the 'no wifi' reviews; I actually thought that 'I wont get one of those', ...but I did..., and since no one had said that HP has a fix, I was ready to return my laptop to Amazon for a replacement because the laptop itself is great as far as features and performance[so far]. Well, I called Amazon and they got HP Support in on a 3-way call. HP used the HP Support Assistant app on the laptop to diagnose and temp-fix the issue, once I was on wifi,  they remotely updated all drivers associated with the wifi issue, and the laptop in general, for a permanent wifi fix, this, all via the wifi connection; and, they are waiting for my update to ensure that the issue is resolved permanently, so for now, I am impressed with the HP laptop and the HP support. I just wish I didnt have a need for the support in the first place. Also, after watching what the tech did remotely, a knowledgeable  person who is AWARE of the HP Support Assistant app could troubleshoot and fix the wifi issue themselves as long as they then also go to the HP site and update the laptop wifi and any other recommended out of date drivers; But again, we shouldnt have to do that... last note, I also have a 3 year old HP Envy laptop that I can now hand off to a family member, it has been bulletproof since day one. I hope to do and say the same about this one in 3 years, minus this incident.","HP 15.6-inch Laptop, 11th Generation Intel Core i5-1135G7, Intel Iris Xe Graphics, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, Windows 11 Home (15-dy2024nr, Natural silver)",$519.00

I have only had a chunky old microsoft something or another in like 2007 that didn't even connect to the internet. In senior year of high school we had chrome books, and those were so simple to use.

It's a computer!  You have to either know how to use it, learn how to use it, or buy support.  I've had this computer for 5 months and yes, yesterday I couldn't connect to Wi-Fi.  Blamed it on this laptop and wondered if I had purchased a warranty.  (I didn't.)  Started reading the reviews.  But then I tried figuring out why my Wi-Fi isn't connecting (via my cell phone).  It took a while, I learned a lot of computer innards, and after successfully connecting to Wi-Fi, I'm typing this review from it.  Wi-Fi problem had nothing to do with laptop.  The laptop actually helped me fix it via diagnostics program. This laptop is great!  Superfast! Pages load instantly - something I wasn't used to with my previous laptops.  Plenty of space for all my ""stuff"" in the form of photos, videos, family trees, and also my husband's business programs, logs, documents and files.

27,Karsten T. Brown,"February 8, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent For The Price,"When judging this laptop, always keep the price in mind.First, the cons:Is it a gaming computer? No; the graphics adapter isn't intended for that purpose. Is the housing suitable for those (e.g., children) who toss around electronics without regard for their durability? No; it is cheap plastic. Don't buy it if you expect to use it for those purposes. The matte screen isn't the brightest. The sound quality isn't immersive. There is no optical drive.Now, the pros:The price. This is a 15"" laptop with Windows 11. Even though the laptop isn't for gaming, I have used Adobe cs6 software with no issues— Premiere Pro, Photoshop, Audition. Rendering video isn't super speedy, but it isn't unreasonable. I was extremely doubtful it could run those programs, and didn't buy it for that purpose, as I have another computer for it, but it was definitely a great and welcome surprise.Who should buy this laptop? Anyone who wants a light-weight computer for school, travel, or home, on which they can use email, stream video, take notes, browse the internet, or even edit photos and short videos in Photoshop and Premiere Pro.[As a sidenote, I suspect this laptop would have no issues with the beautiful and ubiquitous memory hog, Google Chrome, but I have not installed it. If you do a lot of browsing— and who doesn't?— then I would suggest looking at other browsers, such as Vivaldi. I offer that advise no matter which computer you might be using, so it is not specific to this laptop.]","HP 15.6-inch Laptop, 11th Generation Intel Core i5-1135G7, Intel Iris Xe Graphics, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, Windows 11 Home (15-dy2024nr, Natural silver)",$519.00

I knew I wasn't going to like the track pad for the mouse, so dropped $20 on trackball, nbd.  What I didn't expect was that one month after purchase machine would completely lose the wifi card. Like gone. One day woke up, no wifi, no driver, no hardware, NO ICON. Nothing. Can't find it.  OS troubleshoot says connect ethernet cable. THERE IS NO ETHERNET PORT ON MACHINE. Didn't think I'd need one, features went on and on about how blazing fast the wifi was.  What wifi? No wifi here. Randomly had a cheap usb wifi dongle in a drawer, amazing luck. Connect to internet. Run windows update, wifi back! Hooray! Two days later, where's the wifi? What wifi? No wifi here. Doesn't look like there ever was. Back to the dongle. Run windows update, nothing. Uh oh. Update drivers, nothing. Update BIOS, nothing. Uninstall / reinstall drivers, nothing. HP diagnostic program is a joke. Won't run unless I'm connected to the internet. What? How's that supposed to help troubleshoot connection issues? Device manager has no hardware/drivers. Not even hidden ones. Hours of research on the internet. Tried a bunch of command prompt stuff people said worked for them. Nothing. Countless restarts. Long story short error 45 accross the board, no hardware detected.  I'm giving up. 1 month into my 2 year protection program, but not worth time or energy to send back. Dropped $35 on a better wifi dongle, gonna roll with that for time being.

38,Chubb,"May 24, 2022",1.0 out of 5 stars,The laptop arrived with a crack case,"We bought this computer to replace one that was ""irredeemable"". It has an i5 Intel processor which appears to be ten times faster than the i3.  I am not sure why the speed has increased, but we like it a whole lot better.  The only way we could make the old one useable was to leave it on 24 hours a day.  This computer closes down when we shut the lid and starts up when we lift it.  The only reason we bought this computer was to have a computer that is only used for financial matters----we do not search the web or receive e-mails.  The main reason we bought this laptop from Amazon was the 4 year extended warranty, which, I was told, included tech support.  We had a lot of problems with the last laptop, and needed tech support which was only good for one year.  (By the way, it is interesting that we enjoyed the last computer until one day Microsoft ""updated"" my windows 10 and then the computer stopped working.  I contacted Microsoft and told them how the computer worked fine until they ""updated"" my computer, and asked if they would fix it.  They said they would be glad to fix it for a $99 charge.  At that point I was loud and angry.  I explained that I felt that this was ransom ware.  ""You screwed up my computer and for $99 you will fix it"".  I said I would not pay such ransom ware money.  I would throw my computer away first and buy a new one.  I contacted Acer tech support and they said they would fix it for nothing.  They did, and when asked how I could keep this from happening again they said just unclick the ""automatic update button"".  I did just that and for 4 years I loved my computer again.)  An update to my review:  the laptop arrived with a crack on the face just to the left of the top left speaker.  I returned the computer to the supplier and they gave me credit for it minus $77.70 for a restocking charge.  No doubt they are restocking the computer so they can sell it to you and pull the same scam on you.-----------A further update on my refund----------The seller (Tech Deals Store) is refusing to refund all my money since I opened the box and started using it before I discovered the crack.  I have asked for a full refund, and am awaiting their answer.  If I don't receive my money then I will contact Amazon and ask them for the remainder off my refund.  If that doesn't work then I will file a dispute with my credit card company.  ( I am not letting Tech Deals Store get by with this scam.)  Further update---- Amazon gave me the $77.70 back.  I hope I remember the name ""Tech Deals Store"" and never buy from these people again.","HP 15.6-inch Laptop, 11th Generation Intel Core i5-1135G7, Intel Iris Xe Graphics, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, Windows 11 Home (15-dy2024nr, Natural silver)",$519.00

The only problem with it is the keyboard, without full light over it you can barely read it and it is not backlit, the letters are etched over silver keys, very hard to read them. I had to buy a desk top lamp to use the laptop.

This laptop was really easy to get set up. I haven't had a bigger laptop in a long time but as a college student it's much better to have large screen and keyboard to do work. It's not a touch screen, which I really like.

46,Rotsukon Gulin,"November 22, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great low price laptop,"I don’t have any issue with the screen display and no issue connecting to Microsoft account and store. It worked right out of the box! I just have to set up some things before the first use.The keyboard could have a backlit display for use at night time tho! The keyboard itself is a little bit confusing because it has so many buttons that are unnecessary, people don’t use that much of extra things that’s on this keyboard. The screen is bigger than I thought in a good way tho! I am happy with it. I don’t use this for business I just use it to study online classes and general browsing and YouTube. I don’t know if it will satisfy business users if they require more internal storage and more powerful ram, but for me I am satisfied with this laptop and it’s my first ever personal laptop I can only speak for my own experience. Everyone has their own preference! The only suggestion I have is to buy your laptop directly from Amazon not from marketplace sellers! If you need to customize your laptop specifications I suggest you buy from bestbuy and from the manufacturers.

49,jsand145,"December 30, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,I was nervous to buy a laptop off Amazon but it’s been great!,"Let me preface this by saying, I normally use a work laptop for everything so I know absolutely zero about computers. Recently I left my job and took some time off to find a new one and my old laptop died right before I was scheduled to have 5 interviews.  I went to Best Buy and talked with a sales guy and told him my budget and what I needed a laptop for (interviews, using Microsoft office suite, using my cricut) and he found this computer for me. It arrived in 1 day and was easy to set up. I love that there is an independent keypad for numbers. I got through multiple zoom meetings with no glitching. The battery life is great, it’s light weight, and is pretty fast when loading programs. I have zero complaints. There was a prompt about touch screen but I honestly didn’t know it came with one (if it does) so I’ll try that and edit my review. Overall, I’m very happy and if you need a basic computer at a decent price point this is it!","HP 15.6-inch Laptop, 11th Generation Intel Core i5-1135G7, Intel Iris Xe Graphics, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, Windows 11 Home (15-dy2024nr, Natural silver)",$519.00

I plug a USB keyboard and microphone/guitar interface into this laptop and I'm able to create multi-track songs. My caps lock does have an indicator light that works, and I have zero complaints or issues. Maybe some people are reviewing an earlier model?
