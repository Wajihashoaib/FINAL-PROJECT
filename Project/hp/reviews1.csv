0,Catherine,"July 9, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,"A decent, inexpensive laptop. Good for what I do.","I'm a writer and student and use non-MS programs so I could not get a Chromebook. I also needed a laptop so I had a way to write or research when I was travelling. I have a large desktop ""work"" computer where most of my work is done. I had a similar HP laptop but the keyboard and touch pad went out and I expect that those two things are the weakest link in any laptop. Buy a silicon key cover to make the life of your keyboard last, but these laptops, on average last abut 2-3 years. Another thing that will make the computer last longer is to get a USB mouse to avoid using the track pad.About the only difference between the new and the old HPs was that this had 4G of RAM and the other had 8G of RAM. This Stream is definitely good at not seizing or lurching when you watch a movie or video. The other additive that Microsoft has put on this computer is the ""Windows 10-S."" It is easy to get out of, and there is a toggle to change the program to ""Windows 11 Home,"" which is more capable of evading corporate MS's iron handed ownership of my computer. The instructions are online and they send a large postcard with the computer which also has instructions. It is just a  matter of going into ""settings"" and changing it.I do not mind the PC and MS ""marriage"" but I do not want a computer that tells me I can only use their programs which happened with Chromebook. This one is constantly asking (begging) me to turn on my Cloud service, and turn on other MS Programs. I do not do any of that, and I do not want to send my work to the cloud (When I import it into the big machine I will). I like that it has an extra USB port. Otherwise it is pretty basic and reminds me of  Chromebook, (which I like but cannot use because of the non-MS proprietary writing programs I use).As far as using it for entertainment or videos, the sound is nice and loud (but not blasting) the picture is great, and it does not buffer endlessly-- but that may be my internet service.My overall opinion is ""nice.""  It is a good computer for Students or Writers who do not want or need to spend $1000 on top of the line equipment. Nope. this is just a ""tuck it in the bag and go"" type computer.","Newest HP 14"" HD Laptop, Windows 11, Intel Celeron Dual-Core Processor Up to 2.60GHz, 4GB RAM, 64GB SSD, Webcam, Dale Pink(Renewed) (Dale Pink)",$212.99

Other than that it was a nice computer but not what I needed. They shouldn’t advertise it as touchscreen though.  I give them an A for customer support and a nice computer but not what I paid for.
