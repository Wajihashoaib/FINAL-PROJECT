Fast.2.....I'm not sure yet about the battery. I've had one incident in which the notice came on that the battery was low. Usually, I use it so close to where I plug it in that I use that and am not sure abut the battery. This is the second one, the first had a problem and had to be returned. There was some confusion with HP and Amazon, but Amazon came through for us. However, the return wasn't as smooth as most Amazon returns, possibly because it was a computer. It had to be taken toa store that was further away and that I don't shop at.3... The silver keyboard is attractive but makes it hard to see. This could be fixed by making the letters thicker, therefore darker.It is, all in all, a good machine.","HP 17-inch Laptop, 11th Generation Intel Core i5-1135G7, Intel Iris Xe Graphics, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, Windows 11 Home (17-cn0025nr,Natural Silver)",$495.00

At this price I could only get older, used or refurbished  laptops of this and other brands so it was a no brainer.I waited for about a year to purchase a new laptop and I'm glad I waited and found this one for under $700.I've been using this laptop for over 2 months now and I have no complaints whatsoever. Everything looks and works great, fast startup and shutdown and it doesn't get hot after many hours of continuous use.I bought a USB splitter and a lamp that I can place right over the keyboard and the lack of  multiple USB ports and a back-lit keyboard was solved!!!","HP 17-inch Laptop, 11th Generation Intel Core i5-1135G7, Intel Iris Xe Graphics, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, Windows 11 Home (17-cn0025nr,Natural Silver)",$495.00

37,Virginia Mike,"April 30, 2022",1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not expect to be logging in using the forward facing camera,"This is a nice little ""utility computer"", seems to have everything I need (no touch screen, but knew that ahead of time).  BUT....  HP decided to get REAL cheap in an underhanded way.  The forward facing camera, while it appears to work just fine, it is NOT an ""IR"" camera and therefore, Windows can NOT log you in using the camera.  So for the next 2-3 years, every time I want to boot this laptop and use it, I'll be typing in passwords and/or PIN's.  Absolutely NO WHERE is this mentioned in all of HP's literature.  Seems a bit twisted to come pre-installed with Windows-11, but then due to a cheap, made in china camera, Windows ""Hello Face"" feature is completely unsupported.  Would NOT buy this product again.  Ever.  This is my 3rd HP laptop and I am shocked that they did this...  A usable cam would not have cost them $5 more.  And then to not be up front about this and kind of ""hide"" this huge shortcoming is disappointing to say the least.  Would Not recommend if this is a feature you plan on using.
