13,Dawn McDowell,"May 15, 2022",2.0 out of 5 stars,I guess it's my own fault,"I was disappointed that my Samsung chromebook, which I paid $500 for, died after only two and a half years, so I thought I would try to save some money on the next one. This HP ""Jacuzzi"" machine is just terrible. The only things I can say for it are that it's lightweight and the battery life seems to be good.I blame myself for not noticing that this machine does not have a touch screen. I just never assumed a chromebook wouldn't have one. The display quality is absolutely awful. You have to have the screen right in front of you, at exactly the right angle, or you can't see anything. Any movement of anyone or anything during a video causes some kind of green splotches to flash on and off all over the screen.I guess I got spoiled with the Samsung, but I learned from this experience not to buy a low-end chromebook. I have returned this already, and after some research (which I should have done in the first place) I went to Lenovo's website and bought a C13 Yoga Thinkpad chromebook, on sale for $349. It's a dream, every bit as good as my previous Samsung, and I'm very happy with it.","HP Chromebook 11-inch Laptop - Up to 15 Hour Battery Life - MediaTek - MT8183 - 4 GB RAM - 32 GB eMMC Storage - 11.6-inch HD Display - with Chrome OSâ„¢ - (11a-na0021nr, 2020 model, Snow White)",$189.00

15,Skylar,"April 22, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not the best,"This is a very slow computer. It feels and works very cheaply. I downloaded one app and the computer would take about 5 second to respond to anything, sometimes more. It also got kinda hot pretty quickly. What sucks is that there isnâ€™t many USB ports, so you wonâ€™t  have enough slots to connect a mouse or keyboard. The mousepad works really weird. You have to do different things with your fingers in order to do a right click.

Itâ€™s a big bummer, I downloaded the game and then saw that it was the mobile version. DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER FOR GAMES.

49,Jan,"January 11, 2022",2.0 out of 5 stars,Can't install a kindle reader.,"My husband has Parkinson's and a tablet with a keyboard is easier for him to use than a touchscreen. He likes to take it to Dr. appointments to play games and read. I had read before I bought this that he could read offline with the cloud reader.  Apparently, Amazon has changed it and it will no longer work unless you are connected to the internet. I prefer to avoid connecting to public wifi. And the android app for kindle will not install. I am very disappointed that he cannot read kindle books offline. Otherwise, it seems pretty nice but I would never have bought it if I had known he could not read kindle books offline.","HP Chromebook 11-inch Laptop - Up to 15 Hour Battery Life - MediaTek - MT8183 - 4 GB RAM - 32 GB eMMC Storage - 11.6-inch HD Display - with Chrome OSâ„¢ - (11a-na0021nr, 2020 model, Snow White)",$189.00
