2,Bernice Nichols-Parmanand,"March 4, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for Grade 3 online learning,"Covid hit and a family of four is now forced to do everything from home, so we head to Amazon and order HP laptops for everyone, from high end to this.My husband suggested this and honestly I was not on board. We have been using this for more than a year and it's fantastic for my 8yr old son's Grade 3 online interactive class. We paired it with a larger screen eventually when the 11"" screen seemed hard on him for 6 hours a day and that's been helpful, but the laptop itself is quite good for the price point.He uses it for normal web browsing to supplement his learning, 6hours of online classes via zoom and after school for watching YouTube and various games. Granted he isn't pressuring it like maybe an adult but he I'd also not as careful, and it's survived.Well worth the money in my view.","2020 Newest HP Stream 11.6 inch HD Laptop, Intel Celeron N4000, 4 GB RAM, 64 GB eMMC, Webcam, HDMI, Windows 10",$195.00

5,Gwhitebeard,"November 16, 2020",5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome for the Money simply a great small laptop.,"I bought this updated 11.5 Stream to replace a 6 year old original version. It functioned flawlessly right out of the box, battery life is all day, over 11 hours and is fully capable of live video streaming. You have to know what you are buying as it does not have a touch screen. however coupled with a small microsoft wireless mouse I don't miss it one bit. The PC itself has a jewel like quality and is easily configured with the Windows software. 64 GB allows for more pictures and applications. simply put, a great value and a marvelous home laptop. It is amazing for the Money! Even comes with Stereo Sound!","2020 Newest HP Stream 11.6 inch HD Laptop, Intel Celeron N4000, 4 GB RAM, 64 GB eMMC, Webcam, HDMI, Windows 10",$195.00
