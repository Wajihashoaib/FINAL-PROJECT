I bought a refurbished one, but the  company said it was new -- whatever -- it was in excellent condition.  I had no complaints on that!It works well in fact it has a better scree resolution than I thought it would and HP always seem to do well ln the audio department.  I might have wished for USB ports -- but so far I have no reason to use them.Apparently, this true of --any-- HP Chromebook but they like to mount the battery underneath the keyboard, and it wiii be a bear to replace!

31,Alberto Lara,"October 12, 2021",2.0 out of 5 stars,Existe error entre el Chromebook anunciado/comprado y el recibido: ‎9FY38UA vs 1G128UA,"He comprado la SERIE 9FY38UA, según la descripción del producto en Amazon y he recibido la Serie 1G128UA, las cuales básicamente difieren en que la 9FY38UA tiene procesador Intel® Pentium® Silver N5000 de 4 núcleos y he recibido HP Chromebook - 14a-na0023cl (1G128UA) con procesador Intel® Celeron® N4000 de 2 núcleos. La mitad del rendimiento!!!El procesador Celeron N5000 descrito en el Título del anuncio no existe, solamente existe Intel Pentium N5000. Desafortunadamente este tipo de errores en el anuncio del producto, no se tienen en cuenta por parte de Amazon, no son corregidos y no se asume los costos de devolución internacional, en mi caso, desde Colombia. Así las cosas, pierdo dinero al hacer la devolución, ya que los costos de envío internacional son muy altos y se termina por no hacer la devolución sopena de perder más dinero.No me fue bien con esta compra. Un procesador con la mitad del rendimiento del esperado si Amazon o su subsidiaria me hubieran enviado el dispositivo correcto!!I have purchased the 9FY38UA SERIES, based on the product description on Amazon and I have received the 1G128UA Series, which basically differ in that the 9FY38UA has a 4-core Intel® Pentium® Silver N5000 processor and I have received HP Chromebook - 14a-na0023cl (1G128UA ) with Intel® Celeron® N4000 2-core processor. Half the performance !!!The Celeron N5000 processor described in the Title of the announcement does not exist, there is only the Intel Pentium N5000. Unfortunately, these types of errors in the advertisement of the product are not taken into account by Amazon, they are not corrected and the international return costs are not assumed, in my case, from Colombia. Thus, I lose money when making the return, since international shipping costs are very high and you end up not making the return, so you lose more money.This purchase did not go well for me.
