0,Jacob ,"May 3, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good for work.,"While setting up the laptop I noticed that there were two scratches on the laptop in total, one being more of a scratch than the other. Hardly noticeable, although overall it looked brand new. I have no real complaints as of yet while using it. It's what I expected, I knew it is not a computer meant for gaming but more for getting some work done. I can easily open 12 tabs, have a youtube vid running and open a word document but it is not going to run Minecraft on the lowest settings, I mean it can but its unplayable in my opinion.The computer does not come with windows 11 installed, I felt lied too when I got it and saw it running windows 10 In S mode out of the box since the description, title and specs clearly say and show windows 11. (running ""S mode"" just means running safe mode) It comes with a card in the box telling you how to disable it, but one disabled it can not be re-enabled. The photos even show windows 11. But not to worry, I simply installed windows 11 on my own after a days worth of updates. A quick google search and one youtube vid can help install it.It does not have an ethernet port. But I got an ethernet to USB adaptor to make pages load faster.The camera? It has one! It works, it will get the job done.No issues with any ports or the charging cable, no issues with the mouse pad. Everything feels brand new.In conclusion, this is a decent laptop at its price for getting work done. So if you need a computer to write an essay for school or need to hop in a zoom call then this can work just as good as your phone. Personally I plan to learn and practice learning some programming languages on it from youtube and such. You even have that ""Guarantee by Amazon"" where you can return it in 90 days or get support.","Newest HP 14"" HD Laptop, Windows 11, Intel Celeron Dual-Core Processor Up to 2.60GHz, 4GB RAM, 64GB SSD, Webcam, Dale Pink(Renewed) (Dale Blue)",$210.99
