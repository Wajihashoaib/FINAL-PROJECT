0,BP,"August 13, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,Would not purchase again,"I like the silver color of the computer, but the keys are are also silver with silver lettering for the keys. I had to buy a keyboard cover that is black and white so I could see the keys. Another very annoying feature is when I click on an article, if it happens to have multiple pages attached to it, the computer fan runs fast and the bottom of the computer feels very warm to the touch. I have to avoid reading articles. Otherwise, the pages load fast.","HP 15 Laptop, AMD Ryzen 3 3250U Processor, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD Storage, 15.6-inch HD Micro-Edge Display, Windows 11 Home, Long-Lasting Battery, HP Fast Charge, 720p Webcam (15-ef2024nr)",$379.51
1,Amazon Customer,"March 11, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent budget PC,"My work laptop is a Microsoft Surface Pro. Now, I like the ""idea"" if a Surface Pro but when it comes to doing actual work, it's useless (reading email, Office365, etc.). So I began looking for a good budget laptop that I can use for work and other personal things while I travel (don't get any ideas, I mean travel and stay with my folks for an extended period of time). This laptop works quite nicely.Everything works above average. I'm not sure about heavy editing with video, music, and like Photoshop, but for the basic purposes of getting work done reading email, using Office 365, and so on it works great. My desktop handles the heavy stuff (yes, actually I hate laptops).I like the size (15"") - easy to carry around. Was a little hesitant about Windows 11 but it turns out pretty similar to 10 (hey - it took me a few years to evolve from DOS to Windows...). It's not touch screen, but that's okay b/c I'm not used to touch screen. It has a separate number pad - bit plus to me entering a lot of numbers. Enough USB ports, etc. and even a USB-C. I like it. It has an SSD which is GREAT. I replaced my desktop HDD with SDD and the time to boot went from about 4 minutes and 40 seconds to about 40 seconds...bit plus there! If you get a laptop, make double-sure it has SDD. Never mind about storage space b/c everything is in the cloud these days anyway.Happy with the purchase! Why didn't I give it a score of 5? I dunno, don't believe anything is the BEST or LEAST I suppose...","HP 15 Laptop, AMD Ryzen 3 3250U Processor, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD Storage, 15.6-inch HD Micro-Edge Display, Windows 11 Home, Long-Lasting Battery, HP Fast Charge, 720p Webcam (15-ef2024nr)",$379.51
