0,DRZ,"June 11, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,The HP Envy 6055e is a Winner!,I love the quality and features of the Envy 6055e. HP Laptop computer's have always been my choice. They last and last. Because I'm not a gamer nor run a home business I don't need a lighting speed or mega space (frankly the average person doesn't either). So I've had my HP laptops for literally 5-8 years before I'm forced to replace them solely due to OUTSIDE programs like windows requiring more and more space.. All I can say about windows is UGH! Constantly battle to clean off 'garbage' apps and their effort to control the world. HP has monitors that are very clear and easy on the eye strain. I don't use cheaters with HP monitors. Those provided by corporations affect your vision. After hours on these my eyes have trouble focusing on TV screen. As time goes on cheaters become necessary to clearly read normal print or images. (Sometimes I replace the 'free' work monitors with my own HP. It's worth saving my vision. Proof of this - I'm over 70 and have great vision - only use +1.00 cheaters for reading menu's in dark restaurants or the tabs they print out when their ink should have been replaced some time ago.,"2020 HP 15 15.6"" HD Touchscreen Premium Laptop - 10th Gen Intel Core i5-1035G1, 16GB DDR4, 512GB SSD, USB Type-C, HDMI, Windows 10 - Silver W",$799.00
1,Amazon Customer,"July 6, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome Laptop!,"We purchased this laptop as a backup for our photo booth business and as I was familiarizing myself with it I realized that this is now going to be our main laptop. It boots up incredibly fast and seems to be faster and more responsive than the i7 we were using. It may be due to the SS drive vs. traditional hard drive, but it makes a big difference! The screen quality is excellent and the I/O has everything that we need to connect the camera, monitor and printer. After a lot of research I am SO glad that I found and purchased this one.","2020 HP 15 15.6"" HD Touchscreen Premium Laptop - 10th Gen Intel Core i5-1035G1, 16GB DDR4, 512GB SSD, USB Type-C, HDMI, Windows 10 - Silver W",$799.00

4,Charles R,"December 20, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice,"I usually don't write reviews but I think this one is warranted.  This has to be the best ""bang for the buck"" machine that I have ever purchased.  The 10th gen 1035G1 i5 is obscenely fast when mixed with the 16gb ddr4 and the 1/2 TB NVMe sdd.  This is elegant as anything as well.  A beautiful chassis.  I was surprised by how light it is.  I guess that is to be expected since I think everything except for the cpu fan is solid state.  The onboard camera is very clear and a driver license text is legible for secure websites.  The CPU includes neural net instructions from the Xeon line for the first time for consumer in the 10th gen chips.  If you are doing data science with development suites like Anaconda using Jupyter notebooks or working with Netbeans or using a MySQL instance for learning this is blazing fast for a great price.In a nutshell, this offers Windows workstation performance with Chromebook simplicity/pricing.*update* (2/2/21)Well I bought this on Dec 16th 19', so I figured an update was in order.  Power on hours read as 2970 according to HWinfo64 and it is still running strong and I have certainly  put it through its paces  Some might say that the UHD G1 graphics are a bit anemic but I think that it's fine for the 1366x768p screen.  Triple A games most likely will be very slow but classic titles like Portal 2 can be played ""maxed out""The Intel 660p QLC drive is also really good i think for the price. Through installing and deleting I have about 13TB worth of mileage on the drive, still very fast, device health of 98% S.M.A.R.T.I have not had any issues with the wi-fi on my unit.  I know it is not the fastest solution out there but on my Asus AC1300 router I get 325mbps from a different floor of the house the hypotenuse length being about 20-25 through a floor and a wall.  I can game on Google Stadia and download a series of torrents and keep my Comcast 100mbps service relatively transmitting a lot of data for hours with no drop-offs on the Wi-Fi.  Now granted I am stationary, I'm not jumping from tabletop to tabletop confusing the beam-forming of the router.So, it a solid performer that can handle some pretty heavy stuff thrown at it.*end of update*","2020 HP 15 15.6"" HD Touchscreen Premium Laptop - 10th Gen Intel Core i5-1035G1, 16GB DDR4, 512GB SSD, USB Type-C, HDMI, Windows 10 - Silver W",$799.00
5,Pineforest,"February 28, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,good design hyperactive mouse,"I like the silver color and the design of the laptop, including the thin edges of the screen and the power button inside.  I had two Lenovo laptops, which had the power button on the right side or left side of the laptop.  Every time I needed to move the laptop from one place to another, I accidentally turned it off.  The other bad thing about the Lenovo computers is the bad design of the screen hinges.  The screen of both laptops cracked around 18 months after I purchased them.  HP makes definitely a better hardware design and I have never had problems with my HP laptops or desktops.","2020 HP 15 15.6"" HD Touchscreen Premium Laptop - 10th Gen Intel Core i5-1035G1, 16GB DDR4, 512GB SSD, USB Type-C, HDMI, Windows 10 - Silver W",$799.00
6,Danny Nguyen,"January 18, 2020",5.0 out of 5 stars,"2020 HP 15 15.6"" HD Touchscreen Premium Laptop","Key Points:- A cheap deal for a competitive performance laptop- Thin & Lightweight (Easy to carry)- Large storage space for basically any consumer need- Comes with HP Customer Service application on set-up (1-year warranty)Experience:If you're like me, you hate to buy something without the full confidence in the product first. Believe me, it's difficult sometimes to buy things online due to the limitation of only being able to rely on other customer's reviews before the product is purchased and arrives at your doorstep. However, I have a pretty positive outlook on this laptop for its price. I attached a few photos to showcase its exterior mechanisms, as well as showcase a general size of what laptop to expect in real-world size (as opposed to reading numbers and expecting to visualize that in your head). The laptop is about 23cm length by 35-36cm width with a thickness of 1.5 cm. The weight is as advertised, it's comfortable to carry around and will fit in thin spaces; it won't occupy too much room in a backpack or luggage. For its technical aspects, I used a free CPU test online called UserBenchmark to compare its performance to other users who also documented their computers/laptops. (This provides a bias as it only takes into account for users who test their computers on that specific software, but it's still a good comparison to get a general idea of the performance the laptop provides.) Attached also is the report containing simplified and relevant data to its specifications. Its computing power is where this computer shines the most, as it performs in the top 75%+ percentile, which is what most consumers will desire, as GPU is of less importance in that they don't intend to purchase a cheaper laptop with the intentions to play heavier & more demanding video games on it. I was actually pleasantly surprised to hear of a lower pricing laptop that came with 16GB of RAM, which is almost unheard of for this price range, and although I didn't document how much free space was available upon receiving and setting it up, there is still ~400+ GB available after transferring the bulk of my applications and user data from my old laptop. For the price it's set at, I personally think it's a great deal since its competitors will often price the same specifications for almost twice the price. As a side note, HP doesn't load the computer with so many useless applications as Lenovo does that the consumer will more than likely never use... (occupying memory). Overall, very happy & satisfied with my purchase, I would thoroughly recommend it, and I look forward to programming code with this laptop.","2020 HP 15 15.6"" HD Touchscreen Premium Laptop - 10th Gen Intel Core i5-1035G1, 16GB DDR4, 512GB SSD, USB Type-C, HDMI, Windows 10 - Silver W",$799.00
7,A guy,"August 29, 2020",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great laptop, good value","Background: I bought this six months ago, weeks before the pandemic. I have been using it 10-12h every day, mainly for work (PhD in biochemistry). I installed Kubuntu on the first day and seldom boot on Windows. Main software I use is Firefox, PyCharmm, Zoom, and office stuff. I do not play games.Overall, it is a great computer. The CPU is quite fast, the NVME SSD is excellent, and 16 Gb is more than enough RAM for my needs. The i5-1035G1 has 4 core/8 threads, and my experience with it is great. I don't recall a single slow down, and some times I even run small 5-10 min jobs. I cannot comment on the GPU, as I don't play games.The usable screen to overall size rate is good, as there is only a small strip of plastic around it, so the laptop it is not that large, as some 15.6"" models. It feels light and thin. But the screen is a bit dim, and not HD. The keyboard is responsive and there is a numpad, which some may seem as useless, but is a pro by me. The touch pad is ok, but I sometimes wish it to be larger.What I dislike most about the laptop is the thermal design. The cooler is noisy and it runs too often. It's annoying. For some reason, the hot air is blown towards the screen, and I think it makes the noise even more obvious. For some reason, I think the fan was even louder on Windows, so be aware! There are some other annoyances (see below).All in all, it's an excellent laptop for the price tag, if you are not playing games or do not need a good GPU for any reason.Pros: - CPU/RAM/SSD combo, ie, great speed - Touchscreen - Good keyboard - Battery lasts for 3h-4h - Light and thinCons - Noisy fan - Screen is a bit dim, and it is not HD (res is 1366x768) - Keyboard is not backlit","2020 HP 15 15.6"" HD Touchscreen Premium Laptop - 10th Gen Intel Core i5-1035G1, 16GB DDR4, 512GB SSD, USB Type-C, HDMI, Windows 10 - Silver W",$799.00

9,Gurmaan singh,"February 17, 2020",4.0 out of 5 stars,ALMOST QUITE GOOD LAPTOP IN THIS PRICE RANGE,"I will try to cover all important information that is necessary before buying this laptop, mainly i will focus on hardware and performance .To start with , I bought this laptop for my study purposes and with 16gb of RAM it works great, However if you are seeking for games as well , i would not recommend this laptop due to low screen quality and Graphic card.MANUFACTURING - The laptop is made of plastic , quality is good but Could not compete metal body. Moreover , I love the design of screen , almost minimum bezel and it gives a premium look. Keyboard keys are smooth.I sometimes face a little issues with touchpad sometimes it stuck or hangs maybe i can call it less sensitive that isn't a big issue to worry also the touchscreen works really fine , no worries at all. There are no lights under keyboard pads,so it makes it difficult to type in dark.PERFORMANCE- This laptop starts pretty fast in almost under 20 secs, it will boot up and take you to desktop. I played Asphalt 9 on this laptop on the very first day and it played smoothly  , and you can play other games also but problem will be that it will be in low quality due to less resolution of screen otherwise processor has no problem in running games (for more information you can search for processor details on google according to your priorities).I would not recommend for gaming purposes.THINGS TO NOTE- Since this product is available from third party you won’t be getting 12 months warranty cause they upgrade the laptop and then deliver further, in my case i got 9 months of warranty.Laptop is quite slim and gives a quite unique look. No problem with wifi and battery (4-5hrs on screen battery backup). This was all i knew , To sum up product requires smooth handling due to plastic build , system never hanged for me although i tried to overload it .So if you are looking for light usage and minimal gaming its great also touchscreen is a great feature. .I have attached few screenshots of the device full name and general specs","2020 HP 15 15.6"" HD Touchscreen Premium Laptop - 10th Gen Intel Core i5-1035G1, 16GB DDR4, 512GB SSD, USB Type-C, HDMI, Windows 10 - Silver W",$799.00

11,jwskatz,"February 16, 2020",4.0 out of 5 stars,Almost awesome,"This a great mid-range computer with up to date requirements.  16G ram, 512 memory, 10th gen Intel i5, and all the goodness of new Windows 10.  It starts almost immediately, in seconds.  It's not overloaded with useless apps, so not much to remove.  There is McAfee antivirus but it's not activated.  So in 1 month I'm not going to get annoying pop - ups asking me to pay for it.It's the first time I've had touch screen.  I didn't think I needed it, and probably wouldn't except that I am not teaching a graphic design class and the touch screen is very helpful.  Instead of using the mouse pad to draw I can use the screen, which is more accurate.  I wish the screen laid flat for tablet mode so that I could draw more easily.  but, hey, I didn't know I needed it and HP would most likely charge more for that.Only one complaint.  The construction wasn't well thought out.  The keyboard sits in a tray so there is a bezel around it.  It is constantly scratching at my wrists as I type.  Look carefully at the picture you can see that the silver underneath wraps up around the black keyboardUPDATE: 2 months into owning this computer and I'm still impressed by the speed.  Still hating the construction of the computer.  It's cheaply built but I'm ok with that because the inside is awesome.  I also found that the mic seems to be directional.  Doing a lot of virtual now and I find if I'm not directly in front of the computer, people say they can't hear me.  I think it needs an external mic.  The screen quality can be better.  The image isn't fantastic, but good enough for my liking.

13,Tony B,"March 7, 2020",4.0 out of 5 stars,For the price its absolutely excellent,"Purchased the 16GB Ram/ 512GB SSD combo option package. Granted I just bought it a week ago so I might always come back and update this if disappointed- but so far so good. You are basically getting a mid level laptop with some premium features at a bargain bin price.Pros-Battery life is good to borderline impressive. For typical typing and internet surfing your getting a good 6+ hours.The touch screen is very good and excellent for scrolling documents or zooming pictures in an intuitive way.The processor / RAM / SSD combo make it very fast.The screen is bright and has a ""glassy"" feel to it.The keyboard is very ""clicky"" and comfortable. The laptop physically feels very ""solid"" and not cheap and plasticy.Cons-I will caveat the cons with theyre all to be expected based on the item description- and when you consider the price (I paid $525) its well within expectations.The resolution is not ""real"" HD- its 1366x768.The fan can be a bit loud at times, not obnoxious ""ten year old Pentium laptop"" old- but a bit louder than you'd expect for something this modern.The integrated graphics is pretty meh. I got a few older but still modern games like Fallout 4 and Deus Ex to play okay but this definitely isn't a gaming laptop.Bottom line is- if you are looking for something really good for school or business, and don't really play games- this is awesome. If you need something more- you're getting what you pay for- go get a more expensive laptop.","2020 HP 15 15.6"" HD Touchscreen Premium Laptop - 10th Gen Intel Core i5-1035G1, 16GB DDR4, 512GB SSD, USB Type-C, HDMI, Windows 10 - Silver W",$799.00
14,Spacerox,"April 25, 2020",4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice laptop but unclear what the specs are,"This is a nice laptop and it performs as I would expect.

Additionally, in the ""Product Details"" it lists the component slots verbatim as: ""1 USB 3 1 Gen 1 Type-C 2 USB 3 1 Gen 1 Type-A 1 HDMI 1 4 1 DisplayPort 1 headphone/microphone combo jack""...without separating the ports - so all of these numbers run together and you really can't tell what it has.

Because, there ARE only (2) USB-3 ports and (1) USB-C port and (1) HDMI port and (1) headphone/speaker jack AND (1) SD card slot (not mentioned anywhere that I can see)...and unless I am confused (which can be the case)...there is no ""Display Port"".

15,Reach_Medic,"April 30, 2020",3.0 out of 5 stars,A solid budget PC,"This is a solid budget PC.  I am currently typing my review using this pc.  The keyboard is small in letter spacing.  There is an extremely cheap plastic feel to the overall product.  The screen is worse that what I had hoped for.  Overall I doubt this PC will last me more that two years.Pros:  budget friendly, responsive computing, USB C, headphone jack and HDMICons:  poor screen, cheap feel, flimsy plastic causes touch pad issues, wifi drops when in sleep mode forces reboot,I came from a MacBook Pro so this was a huge step down in quality and that is really my main complaint.  I switched to PC because I had already made the switch from Apple iPhones to Android and needed something that would work better with my pixel and LG phones which this has done.  I guess it is ok as a mid-low range PC but I cannot get past the feeling that I will be replacing this laptop every two years as I did in the past when I was a PC only kind of guy.  I don't get why Apple can make laptops that feel better and last much longer than any PC I have ever owned ( I was a PC guy from DOS all the way until Windows 8 … when 8 came out there was no way I could stay a windows guy...

It has these drawbacks that prevent me from giving it 5 stars:* It is VERY VERY LOUD.  The fan turned on immediately, stays on almost constantly, and it is not subtle.* The touchpad buttons are not visually demarcated from the touchpad itself, you just press down the bottom corners of the touchpad to effect a mouse click.  However, since those areas are also active touchpad areas, it may be hard to click precisely where you want.  In addition it feels a bit cheap.* The laptop is no wider than the keyboard itself, and the keyboard has a full number pad.  This means that your hands, if you touch-type, are offset to the left of the laptop rather than centered in front of the screen, which is minor but slightly annoying.","2020 HP 15 15.6"" HD Touchscreen Premium Laptop - 10th Gen Intel Core i5-1035G1, 16GB DDR4, 512GB SSD, USB Type-C, HDMI, Windows 10 - Silver W",$799.00

29,md1221,"June 2, 2020",5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice Affordable Model,"I got this laptop because it closely resembled a company issued laptop (HP Probook) I had previously.It is a lovely replacement, sleeker than the one I had before, and much lighter. It only has two USB Ports but that can easily be bypassed.When I first turned it on, I immediately started downloading my programs and setting it up, which was a MISTAKE! I didn't realize how fresh out of the factory this was and how much time it takes to download all the necessary updates. Without them, the computer is super slow and I was really afraid that I just bought a dud...Needless to say a couple of hours later and about 4 restarts to apply updates, it runs like a dream!","2020 HP 15 15.6"" HD Touchscreen Premium Laptop - 10th Gen Intel Core i5-1035G1, 16GB DDR4, 512GB SSD, USB Type-C, HDMI, Windows 10 - Silver W",$799.00

I called Spectrum and all my settings were correct.  They were able to give me a number for HP and again I was suppose to use the HP virtual assistant.

I plugged it in, charging light came on, after 3 hours powered it on...Nothing.  After 6 hours of charging, powered it on...Nothing.  After 24 hours of charging powered it on...Nothing, screen remained black.  No instructions included in the packaging by #HP on how to resolve this problem.7/22/20 on amazon.com I submitted Seller feedback explaining the problems...as of today 7/23/20 I have not had a response from the Seller.The Amazon Return Policy informs me that I have until August 22nd to return this item and it will cost me $50.00 to do so.  This is grossly unfair to me because in Good Faith, I paid IN FULL $698.00 for the laptop and over $200.00 for the shipping and related costs to deliver the laptop to me here in Hungary in Europe.I received the item NOT working and damaged.  Why Amazon must I pay ANYTHING to return this inferior product.  Because the Seller sold it to me in the condition I received it, they should pay Amazon IN FULL to have it returned and restocked or whatever will be done with it.If the Seller #Superdealstore does not reply and give me satisfying assistance, then I will have to cover whatever costs are needed to return the laptop to Amazon, USA.My preference was to privately receive excellent customer service from the Seller and receive a working undamaged laptop replacement, however, since I am under a time constraint, I am left with no option but to make a public complaint in hopes of getting speedy assistance from #Superdealstore.When or IF #Superdealstore properly assists me with this problem, I am more than willing to update this review favorably.","2020 HP 15 15.6"" HD Touchscreen Premium Laptop - 10th Gen Intel Core i5-1035G1, 16GB DDR4, 512GB SSD, USB Type-C, HDMI, Windows 10 - Silver W",$799.00
34,Alex,"July 14, 2022",1.0 out of 5 stars,Crashes & internal issues,"I thought I was in need of a new laptop, being that the hp Pavillion we own is pushing 10 yrs old. I was excited to get this one and get it up and running. What I found:- Laptop looks great and screen is beautiful.- This model is bare bones and didn’t include a lot of extras- Touch-screen functionality is hit and miss. Sometimes it takes several touches to get the the system to recognize the touches- WiFi connectivity was spotty. Kept losing my signal, without moving the computer. Keep in mind, my router is less than a year old, I pay for cable broad band service and none of the other devices (approximately 15- 20) don’t have any connectivity issues, even the 10 year old laptop.- I decided to return this model and am going to get one that’s a bit more expensive and a model I know a bit better.","2020 HP 15 15.6"" HD Touchscreen Premium Laptop - 10th Gen Intel Core i5-1035G1, 16GB DDR4, 512GB SSD, USB Type-C, HDMI, Windows 10 - Silver W",$799.00

After a few weeks of use, I can confidently say that this device is worth much more than $500. The device has masterfully handled every task I've assigned to it. The touch screen is, for lack of a better phrase, a nice touch. Before I received this computer, I used my phone as a computer more often than I did my actual computer. Now that I have this device, I can't wait to put my phone down! I can even manage several of my phone's apps directly from my PC! I would highly recommend this computer to anyone who does a lot of simultaneous casual browsing and computing; this PC's multitasking potential is insane!

37,John Retire,"January 13, 2020",5.0 out of 5 stars,A great laptop so far,"After 5 months of using this computer to work from home, I'm officially disappointed with it. Reasons:-The specs say it has a CPU in the 3.5 range, but mine actually runs between 1.3 and 1.6.-Screen resolution. I didn't notice how low it was before I purchased. I can make due and the picture quality is fine, but over time, it gets annoying to be able to see such a small amount of content on the screen. Web pages often don't display properly.-It doesn't work for Zoom meetings. I have 100 Mbps speed, but get notifications when on Zoom meetings that my connection is unstable. I never get these notifications when zooming on the same network from my iPad or iPhone.-I just don't have any use for a touch screen laptop. All it does is make it a lot easier for my cat to derail my work activity. The touch screen works very well, if that's something you're wanting.-There are much cheaper Acer computers that seem to run much closer to the advertised CPU, have 1920x1080 resolution, and a backlit keyboard.Save yourself some money and frustration and buy an Acer.

The overall ease of Windows 10 is great.  I am not a big fan of touchscreens, so don't use it much.Another complaint in the reviews was the touch pad being sensitive.
