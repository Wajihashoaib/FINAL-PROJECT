0,MNBlackCat80,"August 7, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome HP laptop,We bought this during prime day for $143.26 which was 44% off at that time. It's a great computer and fast. It connects fast and the screen is clear with good graphics. I have no complaints. It's the best laptop I've had so far. It had fast set up also. The pretty blue color is just a bonus and it's not heavy.
