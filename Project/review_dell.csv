2,2,Matt,"June 7, 2021",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not as advertised!,"This laptop has a picture of a stylus pen in the pictures but is not compatible with ANY stylus pen. It clearly states that it doesn't come with a stylus pen, which is fine. For the price I just bought one separately. Bought laptop because specs were good. Great amount of memory, HD space and Ghz.  Laptop performs functions well and quick. The battery doesn't last less than 6 hrs which is a little less than we would like. The main issue is that the main attraction to these touchscreen 2 in 1's are using stylus pens for art, or simple note taking. It is a main selling point and product description function.  However, the Dell Inspiron 5406 model from Dell comes with a Full FHD screen that is compatible with the Dell Active Pn350m, however this pen only works with FHD 1920x1080 and this laptop has a 1366 x 768 pixels screen.  Not as advertised, I am reaching out to return. Will update later.Not happy that after hours of searching I find that NO STYLUS will work with this screen.","2021 Newest Dell Inspiron 14"" 2-in-1 HD Touchscreen Laptop, 11th Gen Intel Core i3-1115G4, 8GB DDR4 Memory, 256GB PCIe SSD, Webcam, HDMI, WiFi, Backlit Keyboard,Win10 Home, Silver",&598,review1.csv

Downsides are the touch pad doesn't work well (very little control, cursor goes everywhere) which means you need to buy a Bluetooth enabled mouse. It doesn't work well with my HP printer.

First, this is not a gamer laptop, I don't think it's even advertised as such. So, I discounted all the unhappy gamers that were unwilling to dig into their pockets to buy a laptop geared to gaming and instead bought this one, only to be unhappy with the results of their own poor judgement, then proceed to blame the laptop. Moving along. I run my business from my laptop. Thats what the laptop is geared for, business (or personal) use. Excellent graphics. I run my website and accounting software on it, no issues. It's compact, seems fairly sturdy, keyboard is backlit and is a nice size for such a small laptop. My only complaints with this laptop are the battery, like I wish it held a charge longer, but this seems to be an issue with most laptops. I also have a hard time plugging in my USB drive, it does fit in there, but it's a struggle. But overall, I'm very happy with this laptop. 16g ram, i7 processor (11th gen), adequate storage.","Dell Inspiron 13 5310, 13.3 inch QHD (Quad High Definition) Laptop - Thin and Light Intel Core i7-11370H, 16GB DDR4 RAM, 512GB SSD, NVIDIA GeForce MX450, Dell Services - Windows 10 Home",&585,review10.csv
4,4,Miguel Ramos Núñez,"July 7, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good budget ultralight laptop,"Overall, I think this is a good quality budget ultralight. I use it as an ancillary computer at work. On battery, it averages about 8 hrs of continuous use ( I use the balanced power mode), which is mostly web browsing, and checking emails. I have not tried out the camera since I hardly ever use it; I like the idea of the sliding cover. The small footprint and 16:10 aspect are perfect for transporting in a backpack and viewing pdf files. The keyboard and trackpad are the weakest components  of this laptop but I use an external mouse and most typing is done on the desktop. The overall build quality good and the port selection is more than adequate. The screen is good quality and for the price meets my expectations. I upgraded to windows 11 with no issues. The 11370H tiger lake cpu and 16 gb ddr4 lpddr we’re my other requirements for a windows laptop in this price range. The fans will ramp up when doing an update but given the size of the machine, this is expected. Keeping it on ac when doing an update appears to minimize the issue.

They strung me along, offered help and every time it was scheduled, they conveniently had problems that they had to reschedule for. Dell kept closing the service requests and marking them as complete and I kept opening new ones. This happened several times and they deny it until I upload documentation. They strung me along past the Amazon return policy so now I'm stuck. Dell finally agreed to replace it with a new laptop which is a huge inconvenience, but now I just keep getting told to wait (I contact Dell service every day now because they will apparently close the service request if you don't contact them on an unidentified number of days, yet they seem mad that I call in every day as they instructed me to do). Wait. Wait. Two more days. Two more days. Two more days. Wait until they contact you. Just keep waiting. Dell has turned into a garbage company that just wants to throw garbage out and reap the money but never have to talk to customers or take care of their defects.

This time checking the laptop it was hot enough that it didn't want to touch it much. So I let it cool and put a laptop cooler under it and it has worked great since.

0,0,1eyejacks,"August 22, 2013",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good Laptop,"The Dell D630's were made in 2007 and 2008 and are a nice sturdy and rugged laptop--not like some of the all plastic ones. So it weights a bit more and the technology is 5-6 years old. It's also had 5-6 years of prior use. I need a sturdy laptop for some stuff I do so I gave this a shot. I also needed it right away. I bought this from Red Tag on Amazon and he sent me a good laptop and I've had only a couple small problems. Like the Windows Office included was only a Trial version--not what I wanted. I paid extra for that a 2 extra MB of RAM--the RAM is fine. I left 5 stars because it's a nice clean unit and works well. Pre-sale communication was good, but post sale was erratic. Red Tag has 100% positive feedback.The big thing you have to consider when buying a refurb is price vs value to you. Sure the refurbs are cheaper, but not that much cheaper when you consider that for an extra hundred +/- you can get a brand new laptop, never before used with a 1 year warranty. After looking I see many of the refurbs are way overpriced and I should have bought a new one with new technology.That hundred bucks I may have saved may come back to bite me. Any problems and one little repair will be over $100 so you may want to shop around before you buy a refurb. There are better refurb prices too out there--I discovered later. Next time I'll buy a new laptop, just for the newer technology, warranty, and no prior use. Some of these refurbs and used are way too expensive. Look around the internet first. Prices have really dropped on new laptops too and these refurbs should drop too.I've used mine everyday for nearly 3 months and so far it's fine.

1,1,Vanessa,"December 1, 2011",5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic Little Computer!,"I purchased one of these laptops from Link-Tronics Memory through Amazon, to replace a laptop my grandmother had that she lost in a wildfire in Texas.  She loved it! But more importantly, she took it to her computer guy and he said it was an excellent computer - better than any refurbished computer he sold.Then I purchased one for my sister who has wanted a laptop for a while.Finally I purchased one for my teenage son for Christmas.What I was thrilled about these little laptops is that they came loaded and tweaked almost exactly how I would done. In all honesty, I was prepared with my OS disc and drivers and programs to reformat, but there was no need to do so.The performance of these laptops has far superseded an XPS gaming laptop that was given to me a couple years ago. It's an old model, but that should still say something about the Dell Latitude D630.It's slim and has a nice profile to it, easy to carry with you if you don't have a case.I have refurbished several of our old computers over the years so my advice to those that have had a bad experience with this laptop is that they *are* refurbished. When companies refurbish a computer, they go through and test to see what needs replaced and they replace it or fix it, wipe the drive (or stick a new one in), maybe clean it up a bit, and you have a refurbished computer. Considering the age of the model, there are surely things that will wear out or break much sooner than you would expect from a brand new computer. The lids, keyboards, mouse buttons, and whatnot are guaranteed to have some wear and scratches, it may or may not arrive looking sparkly and new.  Buying refurbished most likely means that calling the manufacturer will do no good for support, as it is no longer under their warranty. Purchasing a refurbished, one should expect these things and set their expectations accordingly. It is not a brand new computer.All in all, the Dell Latitude D630 is a nice little working computer. It makes a perfect gift for kids, or anyone that just wants a decent laptop, but not want to spend a fortune.

2,2,JFF,"December 24, 2013",5.0 out of 5 stars,Just a fantastic piece of equipment.,"The headlines pretty much said how I felt about it. You know that you have something which you value when you are thinking about getting a similar one as a spare-not because you feel the one in your hands it unreliable-because you know that accidents do happen, and you would hate to be without something this efficient for an extended period of time. I purchased one two years ago at what I considered to be a good price, and I just got another one because to me the price was sooo right. They are both performing superbly.One word of caution though: In buying computers-new or old, but especially old, yopu want to try and make sure that you know exactly what you are getting for your money. I wish that amazon would require of their vendors that they post more complete descriptions when it comes to something like a computer, which carries a big price tag and does include many details and components/parts. However, since they don't, make it a point to contact the potential vendor by email with some direct questions before making a purchase. Just because the general product description says one thing does not guarantee that it applies to the one you are buying. Case in point: my second laptop came with a 60GB harddrive, even though in the general description for the Dell 630 laptop, it says an 80GB harddrive. This is still fine by me, because 60 GB from my point of view and my needs, is still substantial, and the device does include all of the features which prompted me to make the purchase in the first place.

Somewhere in the middle. Received on August 1st. In the box was a no-name charger, the computer, ""Instructions"" in very broken English, and a disc for Windows XP. At first glance of the computer, looked OK, however the product key on bottom was for Windows Vista Business. Booted it up, and it completed some installation process and booted to the desktop. Came with AVG and Open Office. Pretty sure the copy of XP installed on it was illegal. Fell apart in a few months.As follows is my experience with the ""computer"".8/1/15: not too bad at first, WiFi slow but not that big of a deal. Ran decently fast, given the age. Ran Hard Disk Sentinel on it. 74% health and six bad sectors. Should have raised a red flag right there, but given the age thought it was OK.October 2015, charger burnt out, had to buy a new one. Still OK, the charger had no brand on it anyways.November 2015: starting around here was when it started to slow down bad. Reinstalling Windows did not help, even trying Windows 7 and the new 10.December 2015: burning capability on disk drive stopped working right. Nothing to do with Windows.January 2016, started getting even slower.February 2016, even slower now. Battery is completely toast. Computer started overheating. Cleaning it out did not help. Started to get Blue Screens of Death. Ran the Hard Disk Sentinel. Health is 33% with 59 bad sectors now. This number would gradually increase and the health would go down with it. Slow enough now that watching YouTube became a chore. As I said before, reinstalling Windows helped nothing.March 2016: 81 bad sectors, 23% health. Almost unusable for anything but the most basic tasks. One night I turned it on and it made hideous noises and took like 10 minutes to boot. Now it's 100 bad sectors and rising. Internal fan was not working at this point. Then you get the Blue Screen of Death saying a critical process has been terminated.

I am very pleased with this purchase and the customer service is awesome. I'd recommend this to people who want a laptop that runs pretty fast, is perfect for Internet, Facebook and general use.

It seems much faster than my rather new Windows 7 Lenovo with an i5 processor and 6GB of ram.  Cold boot-up to running Firefox on the net and using Word is well under two minutes.  When I loaded Office on it, I was going to make some coffee while waiting.  When I turned around and glanced at the computer, it said it was done already.  I thought it probably didn't load, but it did.Yes, I am very happy with this computer.  This was an excellent deal for me.  I expected an old clunker that I could use just as a writer's platform.

When I turn it on The Windows logo comes up and after a while the screen goes grey. Half the time the computer continues normally, but about half the time the computer just sits there and grinds. I have to hold the button down until it goes off. I am on a fixed income which it why I buy low priced computers. It hurts to have to put money aside to repair a refurished computer. Some people trade in their computers because they need or want something new. Others trade in their computers because something is about to break and they do not want to have to get it fixed. You buy these machine it is a crap shoot as to what you are going to get. Dell does not refurbish them, they just reinstall the old software and they do not care it you are ripped off by them.",Dell Latitude D630 14.1-Inch Notebook PC (OS may vary) - Silver,&258,review11.csv

0,0,M. Gomez,"December 5, 2019",3.0 out of 5 stars,BEWARE ! This Dell Inspiron 2 in 1 comes with Windows 10 S !!!,"Just unboxed this little ditty nd completed the initial set up once I got connected to the internet. That process took less time than it took to open the boxes! First critique is that there is no charging light or indicator - that would be useful so I would know if the Unit was operating or even charging. A backlight to the power ON key would have been useful in a similar vein. It's weight and size is perfect for what I wanted and the touch screen is quite nice and reactive. The keyboard is not quite as springy as I am used to but given the laptop's size and weight that can be forgiven. I wanted something light and portable and I have definitely found that. The most major critique I have however is that contrary to what was advertised on this site - this particular device comes with Windows 10S and NOT Windows. Of course this was only discovered when I tried to make the switch to the much preferred Chrome Browser as opposed to WIndows Edge. I mean they did try to hard sell the Edge browser during set up, but I would much rather prefer Chrome due to it's user friendliness and accessibility across my devices. I feel somewhat hoodwinked by the seller! So now to consult You Tube and Google on how to switch out of S Mode and go about my business. With some more usage I may update this review.","Dell Inspiron 11 3195, 2 in 1, 7th Gen AMD A9-9420e W/ Radeon R5 Graphics, 4GB DDR4 2666MHz RAM, 64GB HD, 11.6"" HD (1366 X 768) LED-Backlit Touch Display (i3195-A525GRY-PUS)",&229,review12.csv

Mouse and keyboard started failing as soon as we 1st got it, Dell made us update bios, run tests and many of the normal things, as it does work when you power it up. its clearly not a hardware failure they can just replace. SO everything keyboard or mouse die we just have to power it down and power it up again, soft or hard reset doesn't work have to power it down. Don't waste money on this, it isn't slow it isn't fast it works well as a tablet if only windows didn't kick those ""usb"" devices out i could rule.

0,0,Linda,"October 2, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Chose for ports and amount of RAM,"It's been a few months now and, having solved the Insert key issue detailed below and no further problems at all, I am increasing the stars to 5, but I still want to show the bad experience I had with so-called tech support.This has the HDMI and ethernet and USB ports I needed, which were harder to find than I expected. Also the 12GB of RAM beats most of the ones in this price range. Aside from certain keys being in less convenient positions, I have had no complaints until today when I realized the Insert key works in that it presses, but it does not toggle the insert mode. It's always in overwrite mode. This feature is probably so rarely used by most users that they thought nobody would notice. However, it would make what I'm working on much easier. I also must hold Fn key to enable home and end keys to work, which is annoying but at least they work.Calling Dell support had me in tears when ""Puneet"" took remote control of my computer and immediately closed the browser window, despite my shouting to not do so. I had numerous tabs open with important work, and he didn't even ask, then said he made a mistake and meant to minimize it. What an idiot. I was not using Chrome (and was panicking) so I had trouble finding the ""recently closed"" option, which thankfully restored my tabs but what a giant tool.Anyway his test failed, meaning the key is defective, and my only option is to mail in the only computer I have right now and be without it for 2-3 weeks. I am sure there must be an easier fix, like some setting is not set correctly, but they want their sweet warranty bucks and tried selling me the premium plan. When I had a Dell in the past, a tech guy came to my home, so it's pretty galling that I'd have to pay $119 to get a defective computer fixed or be without it for weeks. (I didn't ask but assume I'd have to pay to ship it for service, which won't be cheap either.) And $119 is for a lower 1-year warranty that won't cover physical damage; that would cost $169.BTW calling support went south from the start. A voice comes on and says there are numbers on the underside of your device, so enter it now. It gives you about 2 seconds to turn the computer over and scrutinize the label to find the number among the many others. To top it off, my label was all smudged as if it had been damaged by water but stuck on anyway. I had no idea what I was looking for and the automated voice switched me to Sales, then sales switched me to tech support, and I could have easily found this service tag number by going to the Dell support page, which automatically recognizes your device and displays it. So more unnecessary stress. No wonder Dell is struggling.Add: I learned that the Insert key is not automatically enabled by the apps I was using, which is weird, so it actually worked fine once I found the setting in the individual programs. Still, tech support stunk.","Dell Inspiron 15 3000 FHD 1080p, AMD Ryzen 5, 8GB Memory, 256GB SSD, AMD Radeon Vega 8 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Black",&429,review13.csv
1,1,Alex,"May 17, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice machine, runs Linux, easy to extend - two or three buts","I bought this machine to run Linux and did not wait long to install the latest Ubuntu 21.04. It works well and so I proceeded to upgrade it to 16GB memory with modules I already had as well as with an extra disk drive in the form of a 2.5 inch SSD to complement the built-in NVMe SSD. After removing the back cover this was easy to do and I am perfectly happy with the result. Couple of warnings, though:* battery life under Linux is poor. I cannot comment on Windows but I get only about 3 hours of usage out of it before I need the charger again. I turned off Bluetooth and activated the 'power saver' setting in Ubuntu. I have not yet played with other power management options in Linux as these tend to be more involved.* Because I need to run virtual machines, I decided to try and upgrade memory to 32GB. Some websites suggest the machine can take this. I was aware of the risk that it would not work and only proceeded because I had another box that I could stick the memory into. Turns out that with 32GB installed the machine would not proceed past the power on self test. It reports memory issues with two orange blinks followed by four white blinks of the power LED. The memory works find in another machine. Btw. Dell documentation states 16GB max and question here on Amazon says it is 8GB per DIMM slot.* I made the mistake of booting into Windows once and connecting to the network. After this I tried to install windows in a VM using the license key from the BIOS (can be extracted under Linux, google it). Microsoft's crazy policies foiled the attempt. If you buy this and intend to run Linux better never boot the pre-installed Windows!Things I like about this laptop:+ matt display, which has a decent 1080p resolution that works great at this size+ extensibility, will add more storage later on once 2TB SSDs are more affordable+ Ethernet port!+ plastic case is actually not as flimsy as some reports made it sound+ pretty good value for moneyThings I don't like:- sound is thin and for video conferencing a headset is needed - business laptop!- USB 2.0 port only on the right-hand side.- can get pretty warm underneath - this is an Intel/AMD box after allHope this helps.","Dell Inspiron 15 3000 FHD 1080p, AMD Ryzen 5, 8GB Memory, 256GB SSD, AMD Radeon Vega 8 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Black",&429,review13.csv
2,2,Loral,"May 18, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Replaced our old Dell Inspiron,"The laptop my wife used mostly was starting to show its age.  The power cord was looking twisted and like it was going to fail, and came out of the laptop way too easy.Then recently, my wife was getting prompts that CHKDSK was running when she started it, and sometimes ran for about 10 minutes before she could use it.I'm a retired IT guy, so I calculated that with the age of the current laptop, its processor speed, RAM, video etc., that it was time to get a new one.My wife does some web searches, eMail, and plays some card games, so we didn't need a gaming computer.  This one is very affordable, and even folded, it's half as thick as her previous one.With that said, this is far from a business class laptop.  It is worth what you pay for it, but that is not a bad thing.  The processor is good, plenty of RAM for her needs, fingerprint logon (she now loves), and a solid state drive (no moving parts).The monitor is nice and bright and very easy to read, even in our sun room.  Battery life is about 3 hours.Also, understand that there is not a CD/DVD drive in this computer.  If you need to install something, you will have to put it on a thumbdrive from your desktop or other computer.  If you know networking like me, I just shared a drive on my home office PC and connected to it.This comes with Windows 10 Home.  You can go into the System settings and you can do an update to Windows 10 Professional if you need an OS that you can connect to a work network.  Price for that is $99.Everyday since we got it, my wife has thanked me for getting this for her.  That may not seem much to some, but from my wife, that's a homerun!","Dell Inspiron 15 3000 FHD 1080p, AMD Ryzen 5, 8GB Memory, 256GB SSD, AMD Radeon Vega 8 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Black",&429,review13.csv
3,3,Purdue Pete,"June 22, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Almost perfect,"I've been using this laptop for about a month, and I've only found 3 things that could be improved.1) the keyboard needs backlighting.  I'm often working in low light situations and the lack of backlighting makes typing very difficult.  I've worked around it by tilting the screen down slightly to help illuminate the keyboard.  This is my biggest complaint.2) the SD card should go all the way in when inserted.  Instead it only goes in about 1/2 way.  This prevents you from inserting the card and leaving it there all the time.3) for some reason the F11 an F12 keys don't default to 'home' and 'end'.  You have to use fcn/F11 and fcn/F12 to access those actions.  This is probably a setting in configuration somewhere, but I haven't found it yet.Battery life appears to be outstanding.

It boots up and shuts down amazingly fast.  The wi-fi and keyboard are adequate.  It would be a great computer, but it has a fatal flaw:  the touchpad.  The touchpad areas for left- and right-click are not easy to use (the sweet spots are in the extreme lower corners) and the cursor-movement portion is so sensitive that when you move it over a portion of the screen that has links, it'll open up everything it passes over.  Plus when you've used it for a while and your finger dries out, the cursor becomes impossible to move at all.  So if this machine had a decent touch pad, or if you can use it with a traditional mouse (which defeats the purpose of a laptop IMO), it would be a value-shopper's dream.  As it stands, it's a nightmare.  I sent mine back.","Dell Inspiron 15 3000 FHD 1080p, AMD Ryzen 5, 8GB Memory, 256GB SSD, AMD Radeon Vega 8 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Black",&429,review13.csv

Keyboard with 10-key number pad.2. HDMI port3. Ethernet port4. Fingerprint scanner/ power button.5. 12GB of RAM6. Full HD 1080p 15"" screen7. Lightweight.8. Slim and sleek modern styling.9. 3 USB ports10. Trackpad with gesture support.11. Speakers offer plenty of volume.12. Webcam is actually pretty good for being only 720p, perfect for online meetings with an indicator LED to let you know when its in use.13. NO BLOATWARE - seriously, none! Except for McAffee, but I was able to easily uninstall it (a first).CONS:1. No USB-C port.2. Battery life could be better.3. Screen brightness is lacking in sunny conditions.4. Fingerprint scanner is fussy.5. No Wi-Fi 6 (outdated)6. Only Bluetooth 4 (outdated)7. Not touchscreen display.8. Keyboard isn't backlit.Listed at around $550, this laptop has a few features I rarely see among laptops - like a comfortable keyboard that includes a dedicated number pad just like a full size keyboard. The keyboard is comfortable, and easy to type on without feeling cramped. The scissor switch keys offer just enough tactile feedback to allow easy touch typing while staying relatively silent. Typing feels crisp and responsive, without the 'mushy' feel you experience when typing on other laptop's keyboards.The smooth, plastic, trackpad, while not nearly as glorious as what you'll find on a MacBook, works well even if it isn't the most responsive. The trackpad supports all the common multi-finger gestures like two finger scrolling, etc. While technically buttonless, the bottom edge of the trackpad has two hidden buttons which serve as the equivalent of a right and left mouse click.Overall laptop build and appearance is very simple and clean, with the entire laptop being made from a single color and texture plastic. It doesn't feel especially high quality, and does sort of feel cheap, but it looks slick with its simple styling and build feels solid and durable for what it is. At this price range, this is all completely in line with what you can expect.The 15inch IPS LED screen is Full HD with a resolution of 1920x1090. At this size the resolution provides a crisp image with no obvious pixilation unless you're right up there with your nose against the screen doing pixel hunting. The color, saturation, and contrast are all pretty average but acceptable for a budget laptop like this. Its worth noting that there is absolutely no backlight bleed along the edges of the screen, nor is there any inconsistencies in the color - screen is highly uniform and consistent which is impressive.Perhaps the one thing that could be better is the range of brightness you have available with the screen. In full daylight, even at full brightness the screen looks pretty dim. For this reason, its probably not best for those who planning on using the laptop while outdoors or something like that.RAM comes stock at 12gb of 2400ghz memory. Plenty of memory for multitasking with tons of web browser tabs open at the same time. AMD Ryzen processor is full capable, although it tends to run hotter than its Intel counterparts, so you'll hear the fan turn on anytime you start doing any changes  to the settings while also doing other things.Battery life is decent, nothing to write home about at 6 hrs on average with moderate usage and less than full screen brightness.Built in ports are great, with one glaring omission - no USB-C port. These days its pretty rare to see a device without one so this ia pretty big bummer. Luckily ports that it does have include two USB-3.0 ports, one USB-2.0, an ethernet port, and an HDMI port.BOTTOM LINE:This is a very competent machine for those looking for a basic computer that offers full desktop functionality at a very affordable price. Overall compact, slim profile that looks as good as it is easy to take with you. Perhaps the best part about it is the keyboard with its 10-key number pad and easy to type on layout.","Dell Inspiron 15 3000 FHD 1080p, AMD Ryzen 5, 8GB Memory, 256GB SSD, AMD Radeon Vega 8 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Black",&429,review13.csv
23,23,RN,"May 3, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great mid-range for all-purpose use,"My youngest son had been using a 13"" MacBook that was our family spare, but didn't actually have his own computer even though that was essentially his.  He had to use it through most of the school year for distance learning throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and used it for playing games and keeping in tough on-line with his school friends.  During the last few months of school it started to have problems charging so we figured it was time to get him his own and one that would meet his needs better.We needed something that would be able to handle doing frequent zoom meetings, basic word processing,  school work, internet browsing, and yet still be able to handle things he enjoys like gaming with his friends.There's a lot of games he wanted to play but were not compatible with Apple systems so a Windows-based computer was ideal.  I checked out games I know he wanted to play from Steam and looked at their minimum system requirements and this laptop meets the minimum requirements for 100% of the games he owns and about 99% of those he has wishlisted.  He's played a number of games from Steam, GOG, and other places.  He's played games like Terraria, Dragon Ball FighterZ, NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 4, Genshin Impact, and Roblox and all of those have played wonderfully on this system with no problems.For schooling this system handled zoom meetings without issue, worked well Micorsoft Office and Google Classroom/Google Docs.  It handles browsers with many multiple tabs open without issue.  The wifi range is excellent and he can get a signal anywhere in our home (my older son has a gaming computer that a lot more than this and cant get a good signal everywhere like this one).  It has ample storage and decent ram along with a video card that seems to be very capable.He's able to hook up his various peripherals without any issues and so far this laptop seems to be able to do everything he needs and currently wants to do.  Will it run every major AAA game, no, probably not.  Is it VR capable, not even close.  Is it a good general all-purpose computer that's good for school/work and moderate gaming, absolutely!  I think the price is pretty reasonable for the specs and functionality of this laptop.","Dell Inspiron 15 3000 FHD 1080p, AMD Ryzen 5, 8GB Memory, 256GB SSD, AMD Radeon Vega 8 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Black",&429,review13.csv
24,24,Captain Slow,"July 8, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good general purpose laptop,"I'm not the most technical user. This machine was simple to set up right out of the box. I went from opening the package to using the laptop/on the internet in about fifteen minutes.The best thing about this laptop is the keyboard. It's not cramped and it has a full numeric keypad. As a 15 inch laptop, the machine isn't one of those tiny little mini-laptops where you have to sacrifice on the keyboard, but it's also not one of those 17-inch monsters that's not really very portable. It's a sweet spot.The trackpad is less than stellar. It's not bad, but it feels a little cheap. I guess I've been spoiled by glass trackpads on other machines in the past. The gestures work nicely though, and there's nothing wrong with it. It's basic.The other thing I don't love about this machine is that for some reason they didn't include even a single USB C port. In 2021, that's an odd choice because the writing is on the wall regarding legacy USB-A ports, even if these are 3.1.This isn't a workhorse - I mean it's good. 12 gigs of RAM with this processer is about the bare minimum to have a pleasant experience with Chrome these days, but more RAM would have been appreciated to future-proof it a bit more. It's also not a gaming PC by any stretch, but that's easily forgiven in a laptop.What I've written above doesn't mean that I think this is a bad laptop. It's good. It's not great. It's a middle-of-the-road Windows laptop. If that's what you're looking for, this one is a solid choice.","Dell Inspiron 15 3000 FHD 1080p, AMD Ryzen 5, 8GB Memory, 256GB SSD, AMD Radeon Vega 8 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Black",&429,review13.csv
25,25,S.A.,"July 12, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great basic business laptop.,"No fancy stuff, but everything is there.CPU,  AMD Ryzen 5 3450U is about same as i5-10310U. 15W, 4cores 8threads, base clock 2.1Ghz, turbocharged to 3.5Ghz. It is a mid range normal 4 cores low voltage CPU. Absolutely good enough for daily use including but not limited to web browsing, video stream.RAM, 12GB, larger than other intel CPU laptop will give you 8G at same price range, 12 is a odd number. I guess it is 8+4G. And I am right. There are two socket on the logic board. one with 8G and the other is 4G. upgradable which is nice. I guess the max you can put 32G into it.SSD. tiny small m.2 ssd. fast enough for daily use. however, if you'd like to. it is upgradeable to full length m.2. Additionally, there is an empty 2.5 inch socket. You were able to put a regular ssd or hdd in place as well!screen and graphic, screen is old school 1080P, no fancy no touch, functional, energy saver, performance saver. Good enough for daily use, but definitely not somewhere you would expected from apple.Keyboard, it has a number pad! a number pad! a number pad! Good keyboard, functional, no fancy light.touch pad is good, but not like a apple touch pad. Just good enough to let you use it without mouse.Overall the laptop is upgradable, actually except CPU is on the logic board, everything else is sample and easy upgrade.gross surface don't catch finger prints, Something similar as lenovo thinkpad.Ports: USB-A 3.2 RJ45, sd card reader, hdmi finger print reader.pros: reasonable price, with tons of configurations. easy upgrade. use less power. less power means less heat.corns: no usbc or thunderbolt 3.","Dell Inspiron 15 3000 FHD 1080p, AMD Ryzen 5, 8GB Memory, 256GB SSD, AMD Radeon Vega 8 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Black",&429,review13.csv
26,26,Nicholas Calderone,"May 16, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Much nicer than the last Inspiron I had. All in all, a great laptop for students","First off, Amazon's system is suggesting I review the touchscreen. I'm guessing it's because people keep asking about it, this laptop does NOT have a touchscreen.The last time I had an Inspiron laptop was back in college and boy is this different. The plastic has been upgraded from cheap colorful gloss to a nice matte black. The laptop has a much nicer shape than the previous ones (maybe it's just the trend because components are better, but it's still a good reason to upgrade if you're carrying around the clunky old ones).For the price, it's got a great screen (also matte, something touchscreens are never offered with) and 12gb of ram rather than the standard 8 you'll see at the same price. It's quite light for its size thanks to the plastic body and the battery lasts plenty for what I'd do with it (mostly used in a classroom with students). I don't really do battery tests because they vary so much by use.The vega graphics are also plenty for games like valorant and league and the larger display (I'm used to 13"") makes media and games easier to take in.My one and only complaint, and it's one I can't stress enough, is that it uses ONLY a barrel jack for charging. I don't understand why companies don't just standardize with usb c. Everything else I have is, even the emergency light I leave in my car.  Standardized chargers make it so much easier to charge devices when I have multiple different types for students.","Dell Inspiron 15 3000 FHD 1080p, AMD Ryzen 5, 8GB Memory, 256GB SSD, AMD Radeon Vega 8 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Black",&429,review13.csv
27,27,Matt B,"May 1, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good all-around computer,"My daughter is about to graduate high school and I thought that a new laptop might be a nice graduation gift for her. This Dell seemed to be a good option for that purpose. I’ve had good experiences in the past with Dell laptops and this one has decent enough specs for her to be able to do most things with it. The laptop is slim and lightweight. It’s very easy to transport from place to place. To test it out, we’ve don’t a lot of basic productivity tasks along with some light gameplay. It’s a good all-around laptop and it’s very peppy for most tasks. The keyboard is very easy to use since it’s a full-size keyboard with a full numeric keypad. I like that this was able to be included without creating a giant laptop that was too large to be easily portable.Even though the laptop is a good machine there is one big modern option that is missing. There is no USB-C port included and that is a little bit of a bummer for us since we use quite a few other USB-C devices. The display isn’t a touchscreen either, but I can live without that. Some of the other reviews here state that this laptop doesn’t come with WiFi 6 and while again, that would be a nice bonus, it’s not a deal-breaker for me. It does only come with Bluetooth 4, which is pretty outdated. I do also wish the keyboard was backlit. That last thing is more of a creative comfort than anything else, but it would be a great feature to include.Overall, the laptop is a very good machine. It offers a lot of the same power and features as most desktop computers do, but it’s versatile and portable. I think this is a good value for the product.","Dell Inspiron 15 3000 FHD 1080p, AMD Ryzen 5, 8GB Memory, 256GB SSD, AMD Radeon Vega 8 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Black",&429,review13.csv
28,28,Sean McGill,"May 8, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Not your Grandpa's Dell,"Dell Inspiron 15 3505, 15.6-inch FHD Non-Touch Laptop - AMD Ryzen 5 3450U, 12GB DDR4 RAM, 512GB SSD, AMD Radeon Vega 8 Graphics, Windows 10 Home - Black (Latest Model)The laptop comes packaged well in a plain brown recyclable box, with markings and specifications for the laptop on the outside. Inside the box, the padding for the laptop is molded, recyclable cardboard pieces. I'm pleased to see that they've taken care to make the packaging recyclable. Along with the laptop, is the power supply in two separate bags, and a quick start guide printed on a small fold-out sheet with lots of pictures. There is a QR code on the instruction booklet so you can use your phone to go directly to the support area on the Dell website and download the full manuals I'd expect. The laptop itself additionally comes packed in a plastic bag, probably to protect it from dust and such during shipping. When you open the laptop, there is a thin foam pad on the top protecting the screen from damage during shipping.The first thing I did was to plug it in to charge, to make sure that the charge was full on the battery. Then I'll go to their website using the QR code and take a look at the instructions. Once you find the support page for Inspiron 3505, just go to the documents and choose the one for setup. That'll take you through the setup step by step. Once you press the power button, it starts to finish the windows setup, and that will take you step by step, walking you through setting up your PC for the first time.It's been a while since I've set up a new PC, and it's interesting to note that now Cortana walks you through step by step for the setup. In addition to the older method of typing on the keyboard and clicking for all the responses, Cortana also can now give you a verbal walkthrough, asking you questions about your preferences and making changes based on what you tell it. Word of warning, factory default on the volume seems to be fairly high, so be prepared for the voice to be moderately loud. The setup also includes a subscription to McAfee antivirus. It's not my usual go-to for antivirus, but since it's included, I'll give it a shot. [I found out later that it's only a 30-day free trial, so I'll be taking that out and going back with Windows defender, which is free, and it works great]It appears that part of the setup also includes checking for any updates that have occurred since the computer was manufactured. Once I put in all of my setup info, it went to a black screen with the message let us take care of everything for you.Once the PC finished setting the up process since I provided my Microsoft login information, it logged me directly into my Microsoft account, and since I prefer my devices to sync, my screen was one of my backgrounds. The first thing I did was open the Dell application, which takes you to my Dell and asks you to set up an account. It appears that registering your Dell account also activates your warranty. [A couple of days later, I received an email from Dell support welcoming me to the Dell family and giving links to the most commonly asked questions, as well as explaining warranty options.]During the setup, I started hearing a jet sound, which I presumed was from a web page I was on. Nope. It was the cooling fan motor firing up for the first time. It's not overly loud, but it does have a quite noticeable volume at speed, sounded different from my older laptop and the sound surprised me a little. It's not so much a traditional fan sound, more like a gentle woosh continually running in the background.Checking out things on the new laptop, it seems that not all, or even close to all of the windows updates installed automatically when I first started the laptop. I'm running Windows updates now, there are at least 10 updates for different things that need to run, including a fairly large system update that took a few minutes, requiring several restarts. With any Windows computer, I recommend running Windows update manually at least once a week, as there are often updates that don't push automatically.In setting up my logins to the computer, evidently, this laptop does not support Windows hello face, it comes up with an error message saying, “Couldn't find a camera compatible with Windows hello face "" So, I guess that particular option is out for this laptop.The other biometric login option is a fingerprint scanner, which this laptop is equipped with. I was able to set up my fingerprint for login using windows security, but I have not been able to use that for a login. [Over several days of trying to use my fingerprint to log in, I was able to get it to start functioning. It appears that it's not entirely intuitive as to which part of your finger touches the button, for me, it was a little bit of a learning curve to touch it in just the correct manner.]The laptop also comes with a maintenance program called Dell support assist. it's not automatic, you have to run it manually. the first time I manually ran the support assist program, it found 7 driver updates that Windows update didn't cover.I installed the Netflix app from the Microsoft store because I like to watch a movie on the laptop once in a while, and I have to say playback on this machine is phenomenal! The wide full screen provides an excellent picture, and the speakers give a sound that's better than my TV at home. I don't know where they hid all that sound on this relatively small laptop body, but it's pretty great. The laptop also comes with an onboard program called Dell Cinema Guide, with which you can combine any and all streaming services that you subscribe so that you can watch everything in one spot.In using this laptop for my everyday tasks, I found that typing on the keyboard isn't a hundred percent accurate.  While I'm definitely not the world's best typist, I found that my fingers would slip off the keys and I had more mistypes than normal. Also, I'm not a touch typist and need to look at the keys every once in a while. While these keys indeed are printed clearly and easy to read, I think the keyboard would be better [as in easier to see] if it was backlit.","Dell Inspiron 15 3000 FHD 1080p, AMD Ryzen 5, 8GB Memory, 256GB SSD, AMD Radeon Vega 8 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Black",&429,review13.csv

0,0,Froggy707,"August 10, 2020",2.0 out of 5 stars,Chromebook Technically Works (That's the best I've got at the moment),"My experience:- Product arrived on time and obviously hand packed...but with very minimal effort to protect the computer during shipment. I received a cardboard (flat rate?) box with the Chromebook wrapped in a single layer of Styrofoam wrapping paper. Charger was in a gallon size zip lock bag. At this point I was expecting the worst, but determined to remain open minded.- Scratches and dings on all exterior surfaces of Chromebook (obviously NOT ""Like New"" condition as advertised). At this point I'm getting frustrated by the clearly misleading description of the product I purchased. But honestly, if the computer works, then do the exterior cosmetics really matter that much?- Opened the Chromebook and the screen is CRACKED. At this point, I'm definitely kicking myself for being a sucker. BUT, the screen cracks are in the black area to the top left of the actually screen viewing area. Maybe a screen protector will hold them in place and this will all just be a funny story one day. All is not lost yet...my optimism knows no bounds...- Plugged up the Chromebook and it took a very long time to load. But it did load! This is a working laptop that my middle-school kiddo can use for remote learning. I'm regaining my composure at this point. Gave the computer to the kiddo and forced myself to concentrate on other things.- That night, kiddo brings me the Chromebook and tells me that the battery isn't working. I ran a battery_test on the Chromebook and no battery was found. Opened up the computer and there is certainly a battery in this thing. No worries, this happens all the time. No telling what life this obviously not ""like new"" battery has had.- Called a local computer store and ordered a brand new battery for $50. Waited 5 days for the store to get my special ordered battery in, but it came as promised and is exactly what I needed. Came home, installed the new battery, and the Chromebook still does not work without a charger plugged in.- Long story short, I bought my kid a very used Chromebook (with a cracked screen) that is incapable of functioning as a laptop because it dies instantly if unplugged.2020 has been one heck of a year. In the grand scheme of things, this buying experience is just not even close to the top of my personal ""unexpected/ridiculous/horrible things that have happened"" list. So, I'm chalking this up to a live and learn experience. My kiddo has a computer that seems to be working at the moment and will do what it needs to for the upcoming remote learning marathon. That said, I've already started socking away what money I can in anticipation of the day that this thing completely craps out. I know, please try to contain your jealousy.I took pictures of the unboxing process and will upload soon...but not right now. Right now this Mama needs a large glass of some nice grape juice.","Dell Chromebook 11 CB1C13 11.6"" Laptop Intel Celeron 2955U 1.40GHz 4GB 16GB SSD",&99,review14.csv

Knowing that Dell makes the best desktops (in my opinion!), I decided to try the laptop. I couldn't believe how fast I fell in love with this laptop. I've had it for over a month now, using it for several hours each day & I have only found 2 problems with it:The color on the display is dull. Not the correct colors. I mean, I don't know the technical terms for all this, but it seems like the coloring that the display shows, is of low quality. It isn't HDR so it's kind of upsetting. I like to have brilliant color.The 2nd problem is the keyboard. The keys are cramped together so it's hard for me to type because I have big fingers. I usually type 95 wpm but on this keyboard I make so many mistakes that it's like I can't type at all!! I'd like the keys more spread out. All laptops seem to have cramped keys, but this one is worse.But, even with those 2 annoyances, I LOVE THIS DELL LAPTOP!!! The price for it was unbelievable! I'm only going to buy Dell's from now on. The customer service is Old School, which means they care. I will add to this in a couple of months so you can see that I will still love my Dell!!January 22, 2022 - I've had my Dell for almost 5 months now. Like I said, I STILL LOVE MY DELL!! I'm getting used to the keys a little bit but I bought a keyboard & attached it to my laptop & it works great. Like I said in my earlier review, Dell's are the best desktop computers, & now I can honestly say that they make the best laptops too. It's worth it to spend a little more because you'll have your Dell for WAY longer than any other brand.  Soooooo, to sum it all up, I LOVE MY DELL LAPTOP!!!

It's not incredibly heavy, but it's certainly not designed as a ""lightweight"" solution.

12,12,Adrieee,"December 13, 2021",1.0 out of 5 stars,Unbelievably Slow & Not Even The Correct Model,"I ordered this laptop in June for a new job I started. I was to be working hybrid, home on Tues/Thurs and in the Office MWF. My old laptop was a janky Lenovo from college that just needed to go, so I did some digging and found this laptop. The reviews were solid, and the price wasn't steep at all so I went for the purchase.Worst. Mistake. Ever. When I say this laptop is slow, this laptop is SLOW. I've done every update possible, checked for out of date drivers and updated the ones that needed updating. I've installed software for security, and mostly use this laptop for work and my own personal work, so nothing dodgy is ever downloaded onto my laptop.It takes about 5-7 minutes for the initial log-in to load, another 7-10 minutes for the laptop to 'wake up' and what feels like 20 years to load apps, such as Chrome or what have you. Even while typing this review, the lag is just ridiculous. The cursor is currently stuck on the word 'even'........ and it's still stuck there.Just slow slow slow all around since day one of getting this laptop.Now here's the kicker... this week and next I'm working from home again, and I decided to check with Dell's website to see if there are any additional driver updates I can find. Now according to the Amazon listing for this laptop, this is a Dell Inspiron 3583. I went to the Dell support website and did a search for the Inspiron 3583, but the website said that this search didn't yield anything. I went to my Amazon orders to make sure I had the correct model, but again the search didn't bring anything up. SO, I put my laptop onto it's monitor to look at the model number that comes on the laptop.......... the laptop I received is AN INSPIRON 3502!?!? Can you say false advertising?????? I'll definitely be filing a complaint with Amazon.Do yourself a favor, and just skip onto the next laptop if you were considering purchasing this one. I've seen other reviews mentioning just how slow this laptop is, and they are absolutely correct. If you have a 5hr work day, you'll be waiting 7hr just to get this thing slightly up and running.

Keyboard is also fine for travel, which again I supplement at home with separate key board.  Could have used more ports but extension ports seem work fine.

Familiar with Dell laptops because of my work computer (5500), and so when I needed a new home laptop, going Dell was a no-brainer.Overall, this device is fantastic, and certainly offers a great alternative to using my Android smartphone for emails and internet browsing; handles Microsoft Office and Adobe products with ease and aplomb also. Windows 11 upgrade arrived about 2 weeks after I set the computer up -- have not had any problems using that OS since installing it then.By no means am I a hardcore user, but it's nice to know that I have the gigs and the vid quality in the chamber, so to speak, if and when needed. Price keeps fluctuating here, so that might be a minor deterrent along with the relatively poor lighting on the screen (my 5500 is much brighter, and it's a 2019).

This does not have an Ethernet jack to plug into the internet.  I was able to order an adapter to plug the Ethernet cable into a USB port. I could have ordered the dock, but that would have added an extra $250 and at that price I should have just bought the upgraded version.The cheaper models of Dell have a known issue where the hinge on the monitor breaks. The screws come loose and if you are not watching, it will damage the plastic around the monitor. I leave my computer on a desk. When I do travel with it, I carry it in a padded laptop case. After 5 months of gentle use, this should not be a problem. I'm shipping it off to Dell for a repair. Technically I'm still under Basic warranty but we know they will still charge me for it.

Not that I wanted one, but Microsoft makes one buy one with Windows 11: I began having issues with my Windows 10 laptop since Windows 11 was announced. 1st, thanks to a local delivery company, delivery was very late on this laptop. Very late and when calling them, they had no idea what was going on. When we contacted Off--- --x, they had no idea what was going on either and didn’t even care. In fact, if we didn’t phone the delivery company, it would never have been delivered. O----- --x was no help in tracking or getting this laptop to us. Shame on O---- --x. A helpful supervisor did take the time to give us a credit but couldn’t do anything else.  I do love the speed of the laptop. It is quite fast. The speakers are lousy. Even on highest level, it is low and tinny. Horrible for a laptop like this. I have two older laptops that have better speakers. However, the biggest con with this laptop is its lack of durability and reliability. Within just 3-1/2 months of use, the touchpad and mouse failed. Can't use it. Through remote testing Dell made the diagnosis that it failed and informed me that they would send me a replacement per the warranty. I am to send the broken one back or have to pay for it. After waiting a week, I checked on Dell.com to find out the status. No status showed and all I could find was, ""Resolution Pending"". What does that mean? I have no idea. Just how long am I supposed to wait to get a replacement part? I can’t use the laptop without it. I don’t like the touchscreen. I would think under warranty the replacement part would have been shipped out directly. No need to say how very disappointed I am in this purchase. The price at the time I purchased in in late February 2022 seemed reasonable. After this, all I can say that it was and is now still overpriced. Save your money and purchase another brand. And I miss having a CD/DVD recorder/player. As with everything else, size shrinks and prices go up. Overall, this purchase was a big nightmare: from the lousy shipping company; Do----- shipping of Jackson, MS to the failed touchpad/mouse, and lack of efficient warranty service and response.

4,4,ppa,"June 13, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,I highly recommend this touchscreen laptop,"I purposely included the word touchscreen in the title because it is a “touchscreen” laptop. I’ve seen some confusion about that in some of the comments. This is a “touchscreen” laptop. I purchased the brand-new version. Used ones are being sold. I bought the new computer. Now be-clear: this is a highly exceptional deal. Value for the money in my opinion is beyond comparison. 16 GB of ram, 128 SSD Drive with one terabyte of HDD, touchscreen tablet, 15.6 inch screen - this is an amazing deal for the price. It’s fast, very very very fast. That’s because of the 16 GB of RAM and the SSD drive. If you don’t know about SSD drive, you want that. It makes the computer Boot up much faster.  This computer actually has two hard drives. It uses the SSD to Boot Up and store data, it’s a solid component and boot up is amazingly fast  it also has 1 TB HDD This computer will last me a very long time. Before I made my purchase I had looked at (I.e., studied for months ) several different Dell laptops. I have an older Dell laptop, it needed replacing. It did not qualify gor Windows 11 upgrade and was getting slower by the hour.  For the speed, the ram, the duel drives, and all of the storage this compares verifiably to the XPS class of dell computer. This laptop comes with Windows 10, but upgrades to Windows 11 upon setup. Computer will remind you to run all the updates for the Dell computer. Once the computer is set up you will see a prompt make sure you run them. Anyway, I strongly recommend purchasing this computer. This is an excellent price for a very very very good computer. Frankly, this is a steal. I’m not a Dell or Amazon employee - just an Amazon prime customer that’s very happy with this purchase of my new laptop. I highly recommend this computer.

6,6,Amazon Customer,"June 18, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Poor performance from the unit and Dell support,"First of all, this review is for my specific model, 2.8GHz I5, SSD+Mech drive, no touchscreen, Amazon combines similar product reviews.  This product had either systemic problem or was defective leading to poor performance, and it was returned.  The nitty gritty is below, but the executive summary is the processor was locked at 0.4GHz, one sixth it's rating.  Imagine buying a Ferrari capable of 240 MPH, and when it arrived it was governed to 40MPH.  I was hoping to work through the issues with dell, but when they turned the tables asking for payment to support a brand new unit, i thought they deserved it back.I spent about 10 hours trying to fix this.  I narrowed it down to the processor thinking it was dissipating 85 watts, which would be a remarkable feat, since the power adapter is only 65 watts.  The speedshift power saving in the chip figures it would be burning up (even though the temps were fine), so it throttled to min speed.  When I was ready to give up I figured I'd call dell.  The level one tech did find a driver or two that the update drivers tool did not find, and he installed them over a period of 90 minutes.  When this did not fix it, he told me he would send an email that would allow me to have a 'software specialist' work on it.  I got the email and it requires a $100 payment prior to the work beginning, are you kidding Dell, I just bought the thing!

0,0,Question&TheAnswer,"March 20, 2012",4.0 out of 5 stars,Refurbished Dell Latitude D620,"I truly give this a 3 1/2 star rating. I'll tell you the Pros and Cons, and what the computer is and isn't made for. I wanted a new Laptop for the online marketing I do since I thought my Toshiba A205 was done for. The shipping from ABCcomputers was fast and everything they said the computer was, was valid information. I was ready to go back to Windows XP OS with the Dell, but decided to install Vista in it instead. The battery and charger worked very well to my surprise lasting well over 2 hours and there were very few cosmetic scratches. Yet the one thing that I cannot get over about the computer was how dim the screen was. I have doubts that all Dell D620 screens come that dark, but it seems as though it's always on a power saving mode for battery life like a typical laptop. It's a slight annoyance, but I believe I can live with it, and I can say this was the greatest of all problems I had with the computer.ABCcomputers described it as a powerful laptop despite it's 1GB RAM memory, 1.65GHz Dou Core Processor and only 80GB HDD memory. To my surprise it was a work horse! Here's the twist, I replaced the 80GB Seagate Hard Drive with an 128GB Solid State Drive in the Dell and could start maybe 10 applications all at the same time including 3 web browsers with practically no application effecting the others performance. Here's another twist; when I found out what was wrong with my Toshiba (a newer computer than the refurbished Dell), I switched the Solid State Drive to the Toshiba that had 2GB RAM, and 1.85 GHz Duo Core Processing. In this experiment, I found the applications sometimes load a few seconds slower than instantly like in the D620. I actually encountered some freezing of applications I had to force close in the Toshiba. This never happened when the SSD was in my Dell D620! I still kept the SSD in the Toshiba because of how bright and wide screened it was over the Dell. Besides, the SSD works good enough in the Toshiba.The computer's processing seems very good with it's original Seagate Harddrive. I really don't know what you can ask for more out of a refub Dell from 2006. This Dell's focus was primarily as a business computer so Word Processing is ideal. I was planning on upgrading the Dell even more by putting in 4 GBs of RAM as it only has 1GB. Before anything my main focus is getting that backlighting brighter as Fn + the UP arrow key does not do the trick. I'm sure that would cost at least over $100, and right now that's too much of an investment out of this secondary computer. At the same time the computer can only use 3.5GB out of the 4GB of RAM because of the BIOS blocking it or 32 bit OS you're using. Either one is the case but I'm not %100 sure. The D620 is not a light computer even though the screen width is just 14 inches wide. They made it pretty sturdy with a Strike Zone feature that probably helps keep your hardware and cpu denying damage.It's not at all a Gaming PC. A video card / whole new motherboard has to be put inside of it just to recognize a newer Microsoft game. So, sorry gaming geeks, you'll have to pay probably another hundred dollars if you wanna play Skyrim and your other favorite games. Gaming wouldn't be exceptional anyway, since the screens brightness isn't top resplendent or enchanting.Concluding my own personal story, I now have a secondary laptop that I'll probably just store files on such as music for I Tunes, and maybe in the future video file, and probably do some web browsing. I think its a good PC, but I would like to know what others feel about their Latitude's backlighting. Comment because I wanna know. It's a decent computer, but I think it would be well worth the $200 if it didn't hurt my eyes to watch lol. Other than that problem I would recommend someone buying this computer and upgrading it as they go making it a super computer like I did.",Dell D620 Laptop Duo Core with Windows XP,&132,review7.csv
1,1,Beli,"July 28, 2015",4.0 out of 5 stars,Would not recommend,"UPDATE: After updating the drivers and disabling the ""pointing stick,"" my previous issue with the cursor disappeared.It has now been one week since, and the problems have not returned. So seeing that the problem was fixed at no additional cost to me, I'm changing my rating from 1 to 4 stars. I recently discovered that the battery only holds its full charge for approx. 1-3 minutes (depending on brightness and open applications) when i attempted to unplug it and take it to another room. I''m not sure if the battery issue is a new development or not, as I rarely use the device unplugged. If not for the battery problem; I'd have given it 5 stars.Initial Review (July 2015):I purchased this laptop to use I'm my business to run office management software back in February. About 4-5 weeks after starting to use it I noticed that at times the cursor would occasionally jump to the upper right or lower left hand corner of the screen. I was usually able to move it back to where I needed it and I ignored what I considered a minor issues... But as the months have passed, thus problem has become much worse. The cursor now goes to the bottom or top of the screen and slides from left to right. I am powerless to stop it. Using a usb mouse does nothing as the problem seems to be coming from either the touchpad or the ball pointer. I'm at my wits end with this problem. I've just started pulling up my patient files for this afternoon and the touchpad has simply stopped working. The ball pointer will only moved left and right but whatever is ring will pull it back to the right hand corner of the screen. I feel like this was a waste of money and a huge inconvenience as I now have to find a way to transfer my records to another computer and as a less than techno savvy person. Im not sure how to go about doing that without the use of the mouse. I googled this issue today and found out that it is a common problem with this model. So BUYER BEWARE!!! I wish I would have read a review like this one before purchasing this laptop. Ill now have to seek proffessional help with this problem (for the sake of saving important records) which will no doubt cost me more than the laptop itself. I suppose I should have been wary of the price in the first place.",Dell D620 Laptop Duo Core with Windows XP,&132,review7.csv

I would not be surprised if parts like the screen and keyboard were replaced because it looks new. The Windows XP OS is a very 'cleaned' up operating system, meaning there is no useless programs and junk. There is a couple extra programs like CCleaner and Malwarebytes that these guys installed which is very useful in case of need because XP is not supported anymore so you will not be able to get updates. Support ended April 2014. You might encounter issues with installing programs that have or will no longer support XP but the initial program will still install and work like Spotify.  It is superfast with great response time on multitasking. Everything is as stated in the sellers description. I run my internet resource off of easytether and support for LGV10 was flawless. An external wireless mouse is an essential with laptops in my opinion. The battery is expected to not completely hold the charge for a great length of time. If you understand that logic, then you understand the purpose. Unplugged is a very short temporary solution. After all, this is an old school laptop.  Keep the ac adapter plugged in when you can and you will be just fine.  If I ever need a laptop again, I will definitely be coming back to this exact spot. This process, value and reliability supersedes any Craigslist nightmare hands down!",Dell D620 Laptop Duo Core with Windows XP,&132,review7.csv
3,3,Brandon Lee Malcore,"July 17, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,Epic for me anyways.,For budget Gamer I found this laptop to be great for league of legendes. (With upgraded RAM to 4 gigs of ram) being capable to run windows 7 32 bit and 64 bit.Video: The graphics are integrated so its simple. It can run hearthstone and leauge without a problem.Sound: I can't say I like the sound on the device. I use a speaker so its working out for me but without it its hard to a lot to be honest.Speed: like I stated before the 2.0 gigs that it comes with can still do the job for the games I play and the videos I watch whilst using only one of the programs but with the upgrate its fantastic.Battery: Another downside to be hosnet it does heat up quickly and if your a gamer like me you know that if you have it unplugged windows ussaly goes into a power saving mode that slows it down significantly. So giving the battary a break from time to time is ideal.As far as non gaming pursues such as surfing the internet and what not. It runs quite well. But you'll have to upgrade your browser for some sites because windows XP is no longer supported by Microsoft. I use firefox for the best performance.You can of course upgrade to windows 7 32 bit and use windows internet explorer 11 but Windows XP doss not run it.All in all if you know your way around a a personal computer this buy is a steal and a great device if upgraded.I love it already.Oh and john the service Representative was also vary awesome for getting shipped to me faster.Thanks John!,Dell D620 Laptop Duo Core with Windows XP,&132,review7.csv
4,4,Ngirilover,"November 26, 2012",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great Computer Great Price...Tampa the Best,"I believe that I have now bought 3 or 4 refurbished computers from Tampa Laptops.  They have all been Dell's with Windows XP operating systems.  The people for whom I have bought these computers are educated poor people in sub-Saharan Africa where computer viruses regularly take down laptops.  These computers have held up well.  They are reasonably quick, and with a good virus protector on them and some instruction about scanning and keeping the virus protector up to date, the people for whom I have gotten these computers have been very happy.  One thing that has helped a great deal is the one on one assistance that I have received from Tampa.  I have always reached a human being there when I call to ask a question.  They have replaced batteries for me that were dead, and they have helped me to understand what additions I need on these computers. While the hard drives are not huge, they are fine for starter computers...especially student computers. My understanding is that the XP system still rates as the best for PC's and this is certainly what my African friends have told me.Their prices are very competitive, and again, their service is terrific.  I'm very sorry they are no longer on Amazon Prime, but I will always buy refurbished computers from Tampa.

If you can get by doing a little cleanup on your own in my opinion you are getting a reasonably good working refurbished unit.Maybe when you place your order you can tell them in the comments section you need  a clean working unit.Perhaps one of the other sellers may give you a cleaner unit but I do know that I have a laptop that arrived fully functional.Cosmetics gets a ""D"".

I had just planned to buy a new laptop but an unexpected illness, bad economy, no job, a computer repair that would cost more than buying another computer and living in a rural community all left me in bad shape. I'm glad to have found a good computer under $200.  The cons: a lot of drivers were outdated as well as the windows xp updates (109) and the battery was dead so I had to buy a new one.  My personal problem was I couldn't do any updates so my usb internet modem wouldn't work.  Since I live rural and the closest wifi is 30 miles one way at McDonald's (their wifi is very slow) I couldn't afford to stay very long and it took me a long time to update my system.  I saved up for a mifi hotspot and had to save up for the prepaid card at $40.00 a month.  So that's why it has taken me so long to reply.

After checking out the products on Amazon I settled for the Dell 620 (630) since it had the speed and power I need for my online job.  The computer had a very good price for the performance it offered, and although I did not expect a whole lot in the looks department, I was pleasantly surprised when I unpacked it a couple of days later.  The item looks as if it had never been used and i would challenge anyone to tell it apart from a new one. It ran right out of the box, and I actually like it, even if I still use mainly my Ibook 4G.  After adding my own sofware  which optimizes the whole system it is now perfect. Wify runs at 12mps which is more than enough to download full movies in a matter of minutes.  It also improved my productivity since the work pops up on the screen almost instantly.  All in all I am very pleased with this product, the service I received, and the customer care offered by Tampa Laptops.  I would recommend them to anyone looking for a used laptop at a more than fair price, and a seller that cares about their customers.

I had another one (same brand and model) but my board died (it was fair after buying it already used and using it hard for a couple of years). So I just used the one I bought here, replaced the hard drive, and it has been working great for about a year.  I upgraded to WINDOWS 10 and it is now working EVEN BETTER!!!!!!I had it updated with all the memory it can get (I think is just 2 GB) and a 1 TB hard drive. But they even sell solid state hard drives for this tough guy. I but a battery replacement every 2 years. It is completely inexpensive. This is a tough, robust, laptop. I am a developer at a major tech company in Seattle, and I use this laptop for my personal self-experimenting. Also I am a Phd student at a top-20 USA university, and this is the computer where I develop, test and show my research to my advisers and colleagues (I do weather computational modeling over non-sql mongo databases) and I run this stuff when riding a bus.

Everything ran right off and no bloatware to deal with, no wifi problems. The hard drive that I got isn't 80 meg but 150, can't beat that. And I like XP. Sure, it isn't supported anymore, but then I don't do things (like go to places that are notorious for virus like porn sites, or open any extensions) that put me at risk (and just smile when people tell me about their problems with Windows 8). Looking around I note that to upgrade to 4gig is about $60, but at the moment there hasn't been a reason. The seller might do it for you with a call, haven't tried. Been having fun playing the original Mass Effect with no problems, mostly I just run internet, play audio books, and watch movies. Only 2 usb ports, but hey, it's cheap to get usb extensions. I'm really enjoying this machine at this price. I note that a lot of people write about the shipping container. Mine was just a USPS box, but it was well wrapped in bubble wrap, don't think there would have been any problems. I am considering getting another for my goddaughter.

The AVG anti virus came up almost immediately after I got thing somewhat configured.  It told me there was a virus on the computer.  It asked if I wanted AVG to remove the virus and I chose this option.  I got on the internet and the AVG anti virus warned me that the same virus was detected again.  I chose to have it removed.  Almost immediately I got a voice message/warning that my files had been encrypted and links were provided to get me where I should go to pay ransom for my files.  Since I had nothing at all on the computer at this point I chuckled to myself about their timing.  I immediately contacted the seller about this issue and told them this was not acceptable.  They promptly sent me another hard drive all loaded with Windows XP(what I had wanted when I bought the laptop) and ready to go.

Contacted Amazon who initially offered refund/exchange but I was really reluctant to do that, first of all because I would have had to scrub this one of personal information and second because they couldn't tell me if the missing drive was a one time occurrence or whether all of them being sold by this vendor were without.  Finally they offered me a partial refund to cover the value of the missing drive.  I opted for that and ordered one [refurb] from Dell that I can install.Having said all that, we like the machine and have no other issues at this point other than discovering Windows 10 has eliminated the Homegroup function so I had to do some research on how to connect to our home networked printer.

Also, the keys on the board are about halfway up the keyboard, and spread out. Took a long time to get used to this layout. Most recently I discovered that this laptop doesn't have a cd rom! I didn't even know to look to make sure that it did have one! I thought it was a basic laptop function, but I hear more and more laptops are being created without them. Apparently cd drives allow a lot of dust inside the computer, and often lead to internal errors.

The tech had to replace the laptop body and said that he has never seen such brittle plastic in his 20 years of experience. Not only did all the little rivet's fall out, but three of the hinge screws were broken out of the plastic. What was even more depressing was that the replacement body's screen is not a touch screen as I had before. Overall, do not buy this unit.

It's still very heavy in the order of old school laptops.  However, it's processes fast.  Mine is not a touch screen laptop.  Another thing that I wanted to know but the seller didn't list in the ad is MS Office installed.  Yes, but I've read reviews that it's a trial. I've not received a notice yet that it's a trial version. Also, it has McAfee protection. I'm not sure if that is a trial version or not.  Seller, these are the two things I'd suggest you ad to the ad so that potential buyers know this upfront and are not having to guess.Other than, the order arrived on time as promised. I recommend this seller but do hope they put more relevant information in the ad about the software installed.  This would be helpful to the average purchaser who are not tech nerds. We'd like to know what's installed, if it's a trial version or not, etc.  If the ad had this information and I missed it, I apologize.  Maybe it should be featured more prominently because I searched and searched, prior to making this purchase, and didn't see the information upfront. I didn't have the time to postpone making a purchase until I posted a question and then wait around until someone decides to answer.

I needed a laptop with a finish that could take a bit of abuse and won't show off scratches and prints prominently. The matte black, textured finish does exactly that.The touchscreen is a wonderful feature because I'm not completely adept with the touch pad. It makes it easier to navigate hard to get to forms and links. Unfortunately, the screen is a high gloss which will show off every print, scratch and abrasion it may suffer from. It seems counter intuitive for a touchscreen monitor though it's easily solved by placing a matte screen protector on it which everyone will end up doing anyhow.It's very slim, light weight and I like that very much. The 15.6"" screen is a dream! It definitely gives you the impression that the laptop is high quality and let's you enjoy watching videos and movies with confidence.

8,8,Doc Smith,"April 5, 2021",1.0 out of 5 stars,Big Disappointment and Failure,"I bought this laptop for one reason....so my isolated 87 year old mother could have contact with her children during COVID. I spent much time researching what computer would be the best for video conferencing--specifically on Zoom. So two of the most important things required on this laptop were quality built-in mic and webcam. It also needed to be reliable and easy to use. I could not be there in person to handle any tech issues for my mother so I needed to have confidence everything would work. The very first time she connected on Zoom, we realized the built in mic was crap. We could barely her voice when she would start talking, then it would get louder, then faded in and out. (I learned after additional research many others have had this some issue) She had an external mic, so she plugged that in and it worked, so I let that issue go. Everything was fine until today, Easter Sunday. I was looking forward to a Zoom meeting with my son and mother, but learned my mother's Dell was slow as molasses and after an update, her built in webcam no longer worked on Zoom. After an hour of trying to trouble shoot with her and even having my son who is an IT professional living outside the country work with her, determined there is something seriously wrong with the laptop. My mother lives 360 miles away from me and I'm not sure what I can do to help her at this point. This was supposed to be a reliable computer excellent for video conferencing with awesome mic and webcam. So instead of Easter Sunday ending with an awesome virtual get-together with my loved ones, I am now stressed, in tears, and angry.

It looks like there is liquid behind the screen when I powered it down.Customer service online chat and to the call center said I dropped the screen and it was obviously cracked from the pic I uploaded. After trying to explain numerous times that it only looks cracked when the monitor is on. When turned off there are no cracks, but both reps refused to deal with me and didn’t want to see another pic. Finally I asked for a manager explaining the screen problem and he sent a prepaid box to ship it to their repair center. He did state that if I cracked or dropped the unit  then they will not fix it, but if they find it is a hardware problem they will repair it for free under their warranty. I also explained that I purchased accident insurance when I purchased the laptop, but I’m not claiming it as an accident, because it was just sitting in my bed when the screen went wonky. Now the screen won’t turn on at all.
