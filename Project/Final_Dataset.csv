1,Amazon Customer,2021,4,Fair enough,Well enough. For that price they could've put a better screen but it's well enough. Up to the date it is working wast enough.,"2021 Newest Dell Inspiron 14"" 2-in-1 HD Touchscreen Laptop, 11th Gen Intel Core i3-1115G4, 8GB DDR4 Memory, 256GB PCIe SSD, Webcam, HDMI, WiFi, Backlit Keyboard,Win10 Home, Silver",598,dell
2,Matt,2021,1,Not as advertised!,"This laptop has a picture of a stylus pen in the pictures but is not compatible with ANY stylus pen. It clearly states that it doesn't come with a stylus pen, which is fine. For the price I just bought one separately. Bought laptop because specs were good. Great amount of memory, HD space and Ghz.  Laptop performs functions well and quick. The battery doesn't last less than 6 hrs which is a little less than we would like. The main issue is that the main attraction to these touchscreen 2 in 1's are using stylus pens for art, or simple note taking. It is a main selling point and product description function.  However, the Dell Inspiron 5406 model from Dell comes with a Full FHD screen that is compatible with the Dell Active Pn350m, however this pen only works with FHD 1920x1080 and this laptop has a 1366 x 768 pixels screen.  Not as advertised, I am reaching out to return. Will update later.Not happy that after hours of searching I find that NO STYLUS will work with this screen.","2021 Newest Dell Inspiron 14"" 2-in-1 HD Touchscreen Laptop, 11th Gen Intel Core i3-1115G4, 8GB DDR4 Memory, 256GB PCIe SSD, Webcam, HDMI, WiFi, Backlit Keyboard,Win10 Home, Silver",598,dell

6,Amazon Customer,2022,1,It just doesnt work,"I can't sign in to one of the accounts on the device, and I can't remove the account without signing into it. I can't even factory reset it because that also requires the pin from the account that I can't sign in to. If I try to reset the pin it doesn't let me, and It randomly black screens until it turns off and you cant even turn it off manually because the power button doesn't work and the battery is installed internally so you just have to wait for it to die or take the whole thing apart and unplug the battery put it back in and reassemble it.

Wouldn't recommend buying it.","2021 Newest Dell Inspiron 14"" 2-in-1 HD Touchscreen Laptop, 11th Gen Intel Core i3-1115G4, 8GB DDR4 Memory, 256GB PCIe SSD, Webcam, HDMI, WiFi, Backlit Keyboard,Win10 Home, Silver",598,dell

17,Cthulhu_013,2022,4,It's ok.,"Very lightweight and portable. Works fine and seems to be decent quality. Downsides are the touch pad doesn't work well (very little control, cursor goes everywhere) which means you need to buy a Bluetooth enabled mouse. It doesn't work well with my HP printer. It honestly sees the printer as a virus. Had to buy a different printer. Also, battery life is lacking. It drains quickly even when. Laptop is off.  If had to purchase again I would have gone with a bigger more powerful laptop.","Dell Inspiron 13 5310, 13.3 inch QHD (Quad High Definition) Laptop - Thin and Light Intel Core i7-11370H, 16GB DDR4 RAM, 512GB SSD, NVIDIA GeForce MX450, Dell Services - Windows 10 Home",585,dell
18,Eduardo Paz,2022,3,Decepcionado,"This product is promoted as a laptop with a long battery life, at most it is really 4 hours of normal use such as viewing social networks, videos and zoom. An important detail is that fingerprint recognition fails quite a bit, and the worst thing is the definitely bad trackpad (mouse). It stays stuck at all times. All this combined makes for a lackluster user experience.--------------------------------Se promociona este producto como una portátil con batería de larga vida, a lo sumo son 4 horas realmente de uso normal como ser ver redes sociales, videos y zoom.

20,C. A. Hauer,2021,5,Satisfied with purchase,"When I was deciding on which laptop to buy, well, I read the feedback. First, this is not a gamer laptop, I don't think it's even advertised as such. So, I discounted all the unhappy gamers that were unwilling to dig into their pockets to buy a laptop geared to gaming and instead bought this one, only to be unhappy with the results of their own poor judgement, then proceed to blame the laptop. Moving along. I run my business from my laptop. Thats what the laptop is geared for, business (or personal) use. Excellent graphics. I run my website and accounting software on it, no issues. It's compact, seems fairly sturdy, keyboard is backlit and is a nice size for such a small laptop. My only complaints with this laptop are the battery, like I wish it held a charge longer, but this seems to be an issue with most laptops. I also have a hard time plugging in my USB drive, it does fit in there, but it's a struggle. But overall, I'm very happy with this laptop. 16g ram, i7 processor (11th gen), adequate storage.","Dell Inspiron 13 5310, 13.3 inch QHD (Quad High Definition) Laptop - Thin and Light Intel Core i7-11370H, 16GB DDR4 RAM, 512GB SSD, NVIDIA GeForce MX450, Dell Services - Windows 10 Home",585,dell
21,Miguel Ramos Núñez,2022,5,Good budget ultralight laptop,"Overall, I think this is a good quality budget ultralight. I use it as an ancillary computer at work. On battery, it averages about 8 hrs of continuous use ( I use the balanced power mode), which is mostly web browsing, and checking emails. I have not tried out the camera since I hardly ever use it; I like the idea of the sliding cover. The small footprint and 16:10 aspect are perfect for transporting in a backpack and viewing pdf files. The keyboard and trackpad are the weakest components  of this laptop but I use an external mouse and most typing is done on the desktop. The overall build quality good and the port selection is more than adequate. The screen is good quality and for the price meets my expectations. I upgraded to windows 11 with no issues. The 11370H tiger lake cpu and 16 gb ddr4 lpddr we’re my other requirements for a windows laptop in this price range. The fans will ramp up when doing an update but given the size of the machine, this is expected. Keeping it on ac when doing an update appears to minimize the issue. I am more than satisfied with this machine and highly recommend it as a good budget business ultralight.","Dell Inspiron 13 5310, 13.3 inch QHD (Quad High Definition) Laptop - Thin and Light Intel Core i7-11370H, 16GB DDR4 RAM, 512GB SSD, NVIDIA GeForce MX450, Dell Services - Windows 10 Home",585,dell

24,Liam Manning,2022,3,"Touchpad is bad, Dell service is worse","The touchpad has been defective from the day I received the laptop, but I generally like it so I contacted Dell customer service for options. They strung me along, offered help and every time it was scheduled, they conveniently had problems that they had to reschedule for. Dell kept closing the service requests and marking them as complete and I kept opening new ones. This happened several times and they deny it until I upload documentation. They strung me along past the Amazon return policy so now I'm stuck. Dell finally agreed to replace it with a new laptop which is a huge inconvenience, but now I just keep getting told to wait (I contact Dell service every day now because they will apparently close the service request if you don't contact them on an unidentified number of days, yet they seem mad that I call in every day as they instructed me to do). Wait. Wait. Two more days. Two more days. Two more days. Wait until they contact you. Just keep waiting. Dell has turned into a garbage company that just wants to throw garbage out and reap the money but never have to talk to customers or take care of their defects. Laptop is okay for now, Dell is terrible and I will never buy a Dell product again.","Dell Inspiron 13 5310, 13.3 inch QHD (Quad High Definition) Laptop - Thin and Light Intel Core i7-11370H, 16GB DDR4 RAM, 512GB SSD, NVIDIA GeForce MX450, Dell Services - Windows 10 Home",585,dell

However, the speakers are now starting to go and it can have issues booting up. Overall, its a decent laptop and I have been able to game on it and push it, but I would advise you that its better to buy a different laptop if you want it to last longer than a year before having issues.

27,Disappointed ,2021,5,Bloated,"This is a really nice laptop, however it came with loads of bloatware. Made it really slow.  Took a while to determine what software I needed to remove in order to preserve the battery life. Only have had it for a few months now, but getting adjusted. Overall it’s  not a bad laptop. Just have to adjust it, and remove the software that you don’t need and purchase a better virus protection program, it comes with a renewable mckafee license.

It didn't dawn on me at first to check the temp as I was running this connected to multiple monitors and I didn'tactuallyhave it in my lap. So I ran mem tests, checked event logs etc. Everything came back fine. Fired it up to full functionality and after about 30 mins on just browsing the web, BSOD again. This time checking the laptop it was hot enough that it didn't want to touch it much. So I let it cool and put a laptop cooler under it and it has worked great since. This is a design flaw I believe as to where the vents are located slightly below the inner portion of the hinge from the lid.  The pc itself is great. It's fast, great graphics after I was able to keep it cool to push it and runs many applications at once including teams IDEs, etc. If I had it to do over knowing this I wouldn't buy it again It's a serious design flaw.","Dell Inspiron 13 5310, 13.3 inch QHD (Quad High Definition) Laptop - Thin and Light Intel Core i7-11370H, 16GB DDR4 RAM, 512GB SSD, NVIDIA GeForce MX450, Dell Services - Windows 10 Home",585,dell

Tengo tres problemas con este equipo, uno es el touchpad que no esta funcionando correctamente. Este deja de funcionar por unos segundos y luego vuelve a funcionar. Es bastane estresante cuando estas realizando algo de urgencia y pasa este inconveniente. También he notado que la duración de la batería no es muy buena, la carga se va agotando bastante rápido.

45,SC,2022,1,Price to performance powerhouse,"Other statements made about this laptop that claim it's flaws.....they are correct.Track pad never worked well out of the box. Multiple crashes both on Windows 10 and Windows 11. I did everything anyone with advanced computer knowledge and skills could do.A laptop with these specs and at this price should not run as if it's a 2001 gateway laptop.

67,1eyejacks,2013,4,Good Laptop,"The Dell D630's were made in 2007 and 2008 and are a nice sturdy and rugged laptop--not like some of the all plastic ones. So it weights a bit more and the technology is 5-6 years old. It's also had 5-6 years of prior use. I need a sturdy laptop for some stuff I do so I gave this a shot. I also needed it right away. I bought this from Red Tag on Amazon and he sent me a good laptop and I've had only a couple small problems. Like the Windows Office included was only a Trial version--not what I wanted. I paid extra for that a 2 extra MB of RAM--the RAM is fine. I left 5 stars because it's a nice clean unit and works well. Pre-sale communication was good, but post sale was erratic. Red Tag has 100% positive feedback.The big thing you have to consider when buying a refurb is price vs value to you. Sure the refurbs are cheaper, but not that much cheaper when you consider that for an extra hundred +/- you can get a brand new laptop, never before used with a 1 year warranty. After looking I see many of the refurbs are way overpriced and I should have bought a new one with new technology.That hundred bucks I may have saved may come back to bite me. Any problems and one little repair will be over $100 so you may want to shop around before you buy a refurb. There are better refurb prices too out there--I discovered later. Next time I'll buy a new laptop, just for the newer technology, warranty, and no prior use. Some of these refurbs and used are way too expensive. Look around the internet first. Prices have really dropped on new laptops too and these refurbs should drop too.I've used mine everyday for nearly 3 months and so far it's fine.

68,Vanessa,2011,5,Fantastic Little Computer!,"I purchased one of these laptops from Link-Tronics Memory through Amazon, to replace a laptop my grandmother had that she lost in a wildfire in Texas.  She loved it! But more importantly, she took it to her computer guy and he said it was an excellent computer - better than any refurbished computer he sold.Then I purchased one for my sister who has wanted a laptop for a while.Finally I purchased one for my teenage son for Christmas.What I was thrilled about these little laptops is that they came loaded and tweaked almost exactly how I would done. In all honesty, I was prepared with my OS disc and drivers and programs to reformat, but there was no need to do so.The performance of these laptops has far superseded an XPS gaming laptop that was given to me a couple years ago. It's an old model, but that should still say something about the Dell Latitude D630.It's slim and has a nice profile to it, easy to carry with you if you don't have a case.I have refurbished several of our old computers over the years so my advice to those that have had a bad experience with this laptop is that they *are* refurbished. When companies refurbish a computer, they go through and test to see what needs replaced and they replace it or fix it, wipe the drive (or stick a new one in), maybe clean it up a bit, and you have a refurbished computer. Considering the age of the model, there are surely things that will wear out or break much sooner than you would expect from a brand new computer. The lids, keyboards, mouse buttons, and whatnot are guaranteed to have some wear and scratches, it may or may not arrive looking sparkly and new.  Buying refurbished most likely means that calling the manufacturer will do no good for support, as it is no longer under their warranty. Purchasing a refurbished, one should expect these things and set their expectations accordingly. It is not a brand new computer.All in all, the Dell Latitude D630 is a nice little working computer. It makes a perfect gift for kids, or anyone that just wants a decent laptop, but not want to spend a fortune.  The price is good too - I've looked for months for something and found this to be the best bargain.I would definitely recommend this laptop!",Dell Latitude D630 14.1-Inch Notebook PC (OS may vary) - Silver,258,dell
69,JFF,2013,5,Just a fantastic piece of equipment.,"The headlines pretty much said how I felt about it. You know that you have something which you value when you are thinking about getting a similar one as a spare-not because you feel the one in your hands it unreliable-because you know that accidents do happen, and you would hate to be without something this efficient for an extended period of time. I purchased one two years ago at what I considered to be a good price, and I just got another one because to me the price was sooo right. They are both performing superbly.One word of caution though: In buying computers-new or old, but especially old, yopu want to try and make sure that you know exactly what you are getting for your money. I wish that amazon would require of their vendors that they post more complete descriptions when it comes to something like a computer, which carries a big price tag and does include many details and components/parts. However, since they don't, make it a point to contact the potential vendor by email with some direct questions before making a purchase. Just because the general product description says one thing does not guarantee that it applies to the one you are buying. Case in point: my second laptop came with a 60GB harddrive, even though in the general description for the Dell 630 laptop, it says an 80GB harddrive. This is still fine by me, because 60 GB from my point of view and my needs, is still substantial, and the device does include all of the features which prompted me to make the purchase in the first place. What I am saying is this: it is usually better to know exactly what you are getting into beforehand.",Dell Latitude D630 14.1-Inch Notebook PC (OS may vary) - Silver,258,dell
70,Kyle Chapman,2016,1,Never buy refurb from Discount18!,"Don't do it! Purchased last summer hoping for a not too slow, but also not an extremely high end computer. Somewhere in the middle. Received on August 1st. In the box was a no-name charger, the computer, ""Instructions"" in very broken English, and a disc for Windows XP. At first glance of the computer, looked OK, however the product key on bottom was for Windows Vista Business. Booted it up, and it completed some installation process and booted to the desktop. Came with AVG and Open Office. Pretty sure the copy of XP installed on it was illegal. Fell apart in a few months.As follows is my experience with the ""computer"".8/1/15: not too bad at first, WiFi slow but not that big of a deal. Ran decently fast, given the age. Ran Hard Disk Sentinel on it. 74% health and six bad sectors. Should have raised a red flag right there, but given the age thought it was OK.October 2015, charger burnt out, had to buy a new one. Still OK, the charger had no brand on it anyways.November 2015: starting around here was when it started to slow down bad. Reinstalling Windows did not help, even trying Windows 7 and the new 10.December 2015: burning capability on disk drive stopped working right. Nothing to do with Windows.January 2016, started getting even slower.February 2016, even slower now. Battery is completely toast. Computer started overheating. Cleaning it out did not help. Started to get Blue Screens of Death. Ran the Hard Disk Sentinel. Health is 33% with 59 bad sectors now. This number would gradually increase and the health would go down with it. Slow enough now that watching YouTube became a chore. As I said before, reinstalling Windows helped nothing.March 2016: 81 bad sectors, 23% health. Almost unusable for anything but the most basic tasks. One night I turned it on and it made hideous noises and took like 10 minutes to boot. Now it's 100 bad sectors and rising. Internal fan was not working at this point. Then you get the Blue Screen of Death saying a critical process has been terminated. Then it was done for.Opened it up to find a very old hard drive from an HP computer, and an off brand battery.So if you want an old piece of junk that lasts less than a year, THEN BY ALL MEANS BUY REFURBISHED FROM DISCOUNT18!",Dell Latitude D630 14.1-Inch Notebook PC (OS may vary) - Silver,258,dell

I am very pleased with this purchase and the customer service is awesome. I'd recommend this to people who want a laptop that runs pretty fast, is perfect for Internet, Facebook and general use.

There are also so many other extra bonus features not mention in original description, that I look forward to researching even more!  It runs very well and connection is very fast.  I am very happy with the refurbished Dell and the Cost.  I would definitely recommend this product to others.  Thank you!!",Dell Latitude D630 14.1-Inch Notebook PC (OS may vary) - Silver,258,dell
82,Barbarianz,2013,4,Well Worth It,"I purchased this refurbished about 6 months ago and have been more than pleased with it.  Having been a Mac user since the beginning, I did a lot of research before I decided to buy a PC, let alone a used one.  I was not expecting another Mac, but I wanted a good, daily functional workhorse to have as a backup since my Mac is on its last legs.  It does the basics very well, so I have no complaints about that.  It's also nice to have 4 USB ports instead of 2, and to have a few Windows programs that have proven useful.My only complaint is that the battery is dead within 6 months.  Replacements are not too expensive, so I can live with that.",Dell Latitude D630 14.1-Inch Notebook PC (OS may vary) - Silver,258,dell
83,Tricia Lou,2013,5,For my purposes it works great!,"(If I have a problem I will update this review at that time, but suspect I will not.)  All I wanted is something to use offline, a graphics art program.  I do not want to be online with this laptop - I use a desktop for that - because I don't want to worry about viruses or hackers etc.  messing with my art projects.  Therefore I can't comment on how it works online.The program, Painter X  (X stands for 10, not X rated!), works just as fast and well as it does on my brand new Dell laptop. Ditto Windows XP.  I don't know about the battery since I plan to pretty much leave it in the same spot and keep it plugged in.  Everything looks virtually new.  Also, the person at Incomputer was very swift to answer my little Qs and help me out regarding a problem with the Painter (easily resolved since he knew what to do) Program.

He listens to his customers and cares and upgraded my ram from 2 mb to 3 mb for only $10 extra. Plus he gave me a 9 cell battery which has a long battery life :)LOL.....I felt like I needed to spread the good word about how good the seller All About PC Parts is on here.

I chose a ""like new / refurbished"" previously owned one for it's great price tag but when it arrived it looked totally unused and works perfectly.  Love the screen, NO reflections from bright light or sun, same as the old one.  I think the old one will be my streaming movie entertainment center.

Upon trying to take the battery out & restart it, it told me that Windows was messed up & to use the disk to help reset it. Well, needless to say, it didn't come with a disk so now I have to go & buy a brand new laptop & I get to hear my husband's mouth on how I should've just went to WalMart in the 1st place & I wouldn't have that problem with a new 1.

117,M. Gomez,2019,3,BEWARE ! This Dell Inspiron 2 in 1 comes with Windows 10 S !!!,"Just unboxed this little ditty nd completed the initial set up once I got connected to the internet. That process took less time than it took to open the boxes! First critique is that there is no charging light or indicator - that would be useful so I would know if the Unit was operating or even charging. A backlight to the power ON key would have been useful in a similar vein. It's weight and size is perfect for what I wanted and the touch screen is quite nice and reactive. The keyboard is not quite as springy as I am used to but given the laptop's size and weight that can be forgiven. I wanted something light and portable and I have definitely found that. The most major critique I have however is that contrary to what was advertised on this site - this particular device comes with Windows 10S and NOT Windows. Of course this was only discovered when I tried to make the switch to the much preferred Chrome Browser as opposed to WIndows Edge. I mean they did try to hard sell the Edge browser during set up, but I would much rather prefer Chrome due to it's user friendliness and accessibility across my devices. I feel somewhat hoodwinked by the seller! So now to consult You Tube and Google on how to switch out of S Mode and go about my business.

SO everything keyboard or mouse die we just have to power it down and power it up again, soft or hard reset doesn't work have to power it down.

167,Linda,2021,5,Chose for ports and amount of RAM,"It's been a few months now and, having solved the Insert key issue detailed below and no further problems at all, I am increasing the stars to 5, but I still want to show the bad experience I had with so-called tech support.This has the HDMI and ethernet and USB ports I needed, which were harder to find than I expected. Also the 12GB of RAM beats most of the ones in this price range. Aside from certain keys being in less convenient positions, I have had no complaints until today when I realized the Insert key works in that it presses, but it does not toggle the insert mode. It's always in overwrite mode. This feature is probably so rarely used by most users that they thought nobody would notice. However, it would make what I'm working on much easier. I also must hold Fn key to enable home and end keys to work, which is annoying but at least they work.Calling Dell support had me in tears when ""Puneet"" took remote control of my computer and immediately closed the browser window, despite my shouting to not do so. I had numerous tabs open with important work, and he didn't even ask, then said he made a mistake and meant to minimize it. What an idiot. I was not using Chrome (and was panicking) so I had trouble finding the ""recently closed"" option, which thankfully restored my tabs but what a giant tool.Anyway his test failed, meaning the key is defective, and my only option is to mail in the only computer I have right now and be without it for 2-3 weeks. I am sure there must be an easier fix, like some setting is not set correctly, but they want their sweet warranty bucks and tried selling me the premium plan. When I had a Dell in the past, a tech guy came to my home, so it's pretty galling that I'd have to pay $119 to get a defective computer fixed or be without it for weeks. (I didn't ask but assume I'd have to pay to ship it for service, which won't be cheap either.) And $119 is for a lower 1-year warranty that won't cover physical damage; that would cost $169.BTW calling support went south from the start. A voice comes on and says there are numbers on the underside of your device, so enter it now. It gives you about 2 seconds to turn the computer over and scrutinize the label to find the number among the many others. To top it off, my label was all smudged as if it had been damaged by water but stuck on anyway. I had no idea what I was looking for and the automated voice switched me to Sales, then sales switched me to tech support, and I could have easily found this service tag number by going to the Dell support page, which automatically recognizes your device and displays it. So more unnecessary stress. No wonder Dell is struggling.Add: I learned that the Insert key is not automatically enabled by the apps I was using, which is weird, so it actually worked fine once I found the setting in the individual programs. Still, tech support stunk.","Dell Inspiron 15 3000 FHD 1080p, AMD Ryzen 5, 8GB Memory, 256GB SSD, AMD Radeon Vega 8 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Black",429,dell
168,Alex,2021,4,"Nice machine, runs Linux, easy to extend - two or three buts","I bought this machine to run Linux and did not wait long to install the latest Ubuntu 21.04. It works well and so I proceeded to upgrade it to 16GB memory with modules I already had as well as with an extra disk drive in the form of a 2.5 inch SSD to complement the built-in NVMe SSD. After removing the back cover this was easy to do and I am perfectly happy with the result. Couple of warnings, though:* battery life under Linux is poor. I cannot comment on Windows but I get only about 3 hours of usage out of it before I need the charger again. I turned off Bluetooth and activated the 'power saver' setting in Ubuntu. I have not yet played with other power management options in Linux as these tend to be more involved.* Because I need to run virtual machines, I decided to try and upgrade memory to 32GB. Some websites suggest the machine can take this. I was aware of the risk that it would not work and only proceeded because I had another box that I could stick the memory into. Turns out that with 32GB installed the machine would not proceed past the power on self test. It reports memory issues with two orange blinks followed by four white blinks of the power LED. The memory works find in another machine. Btw. Dell documentation states 16GB max and question here on Amazon says it is 8GB per DIMM slot.* I made the mistake of booting into Windows once and connecting to the network. After this I tried to install windows in a VM using the license key from the BIOS (can be extracted under Linux, google it). Microsoft's crazy policies foiled the attempt. If you buy this and intend to run Linux better never boot the pre-installed Windows!Things I like about this laptop:+ matt display, which has a decent 1080p resolution that works great at this size+ extensibility, will add more storage later on once 2TB SSDs are more affordable+ Ethernet port!+ plastic case is actually not as flimsy as some reports made it sound+ pretty good value for moneyThings I don't like:- sound is thin and for video conferencing a headset is needed - business laptop!- USB 2.0 port only on the right-hand side.- can get pretty warm underneath - this is an Intel/AMD box after allHope this helps.","Dell Inspiron 15 3000 FHD 1080p, AMD Ryzen 5, 8GB Memory, 256GB SSD, AMD Radeon Vega 8 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Black",429,dell
169,Loral,2021,5,Replaced our old Dell Inspiron,"The laptop my wife used mostly was starting to show its age.  The power cord was looking twisted and like it was going to fail, and came out of the laptop way too easy.Then recently, my wife was getting prompts that CHKDSK was running when she started it, and sometimes ran for about 10 minutes before she could use it.I'm a retired IT guy, so I calculated that with the age of the current laptop, its processor speed, RAM, video etc., that it was time to get a new one.My wife does some web searches, eMail, and plays some card games, so we didn't need a gaming computer.  This one is very affordable, and even folded, it's half as thick as her previous one.With that said, this is far from a business class laptop.  It is worth what you pay for it, but that is not a bad thing.  The processor is good, plenty of RAM for her needs, fingerprint logon (she now loves), and a solid state drive (no moving parts).The monitor is nice and bright and very easy to read, even in our sun room.  Battery life is about 3 hours.Also, understand that there is not a CD/DVD drive in this computer.  If you need to install something, you will have to put it on a thumbdrive from your desktop or other computer.  If you know networking like me, I just shared a drive on my home office PC and connected to it.This comes with Windows 10 Home.  You can go into the System settings and you can do an update to Windows 10 Professional if you need an OS that you can connect to a work network.  Price for that is $99.Everyday since we got it, my wife has thanked me for getting this for her.  That may not seem much to some, but from my wife, that's a homerun!","Dell Inspiron 15 3000 FHD 1080p, AMD Ryzen 5, 8GB Memory, 256GB SSD, AMD Radeon Vega 8 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Black",429,dell
170,Purdue Pete,2021,4,Almost perfect,"I've been using this laptop for about a month, and I've only found 3 things that could be improved.1) the keyboard needs backlighting.  I'm often working in low light situations and the lack of backlighting makes typing very difficult.  I've worked around it by tilting the screen down slightly to help illuminate the keyboard.  This is my biggest complaint.2) the SD card should go all the way in when inserted.  Instead it only goes in about 1/2 way.  This prevents you from inserting the card and leaving it there all the time.3) for some reason the F11 an F12 keys don't default to 'home' and 'end'.  You have to use fcn/F11 and fcn/F12 to access those actions.  This is probably a setting in configuration somewhere, but I haven't found it yet.Battery life appears to be outstanding.

175,Starlyn,2022,5,The Touchpad is the fatal flaw,"This laptop has a lot going for it - fast processor, generous SSD main storage, lots of RAM memory, FHD screen.  It boots up and shuts down amazingly fast.  The wi-fi and keyboard are adequate.  It would be a great computer, but it has a fatal flaw:  the touchpad.  The touchpad areas for left- and right-click are not easy to use (the sweet spots are in the extreme lower corners) and the cursor-movement portion is so sensitive that when you move it over a portion of the screen that has links, it'll open up everything it passes over.  Plus when you've used it for a while and your finger dries out, the cursor becomes impossible to move at all.  So if this machine had a decent touch pad, or if you can use it with a traditional mouse (which defeats the purpose of a laptop IMO), it would be a value-shopper's dream.  As it stands, it's a nightmare.  I sent mine back.","Dell Inspiron 15 3000 FHD 1080p, AMD Ryzen 5, 8GB Memory, 256GB SSD, AMD Radeon Vega 8 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Black",429,dell

The Dell Inspiron 15 inch laptop is especially well suited for students who need a simple machine for remote school sessions.SPECS:* 15.6-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) Anti-glare LED Backlight Non-Touch Narrow Border WVA Display* AMD Ryzen 5 3450U Mobile Processor* 12GB 2400MHz DDR4* 512 GB M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD* AMD Radeon Vega 8 Graphics* 802.11ac 1x1 WiFi* Bluetooth 4.1* 720P Webcam with indicator LED when in use.PROS:1.

Slim and sleek modern styling.9. 3 USB ports10. Trackpad with gesture support.11. Speakers offer plenty of volume.12. Webcam is actually pretty good for being only 720p, perfect for online meetings with an indicator LED to let you know when its in use.13. NO BLOATWARE - seriously, none! Except for McAffee, but I was able to easily uninstall it (a first).CONS:1. No USB-C port.2. Battery life could be better.3. Screen brightness is lacking in sunny conditions.4. Fingerprint scanner is fussy.5. No Wi-Fi 6 (outdated)6. Only Bluetooth 4 (outdated)7. Not touchscreen display.8. Keyboard isn't backlit.Listed at around $550, this laptop has a few features I rarely see among laptops - like a comfortable keyboard that includes a dedicated number pad just like a full size keyboard. The keyboard is comfortable, and easy to type on without feeling cramped. The scissor switch keys offer just enough tactile feedback to allow easy touch typing while staying relatively silent. Typing feels crisp and responsive, without the 'mushy' feel you experience when typing on other laptop's keyboards.The smooth, plastic, trackpad, while not nearly as glorious as what you'll find on a MacBook, works well even if it isn't the most responsive. The trackpad supports all the common multi-finger gestures like two finger scrolling, etc. While technically buttonless, the bottom edge of the trackpad has two hidden buttons which serve as the equivalent of a right and left mouse click.Overall laptop build and appearance is very simple and clean, with the entire laptop being made from a single color and texture plastic. It doesn't feel especially high quality, and does sort of feel cheap, but it looks slick with its simple styling and build feels solid and durable for what it is. At this price range, this is all completely in line with what you can expect.The 15inch IPS LED screen is Full HD with a resolution of 1920x1090. At this size the resolution provides a crisp image with no obvious pixilation unless you're right up there with your nose against the screen doing pixel hunting. The color, saturation, and contrast are all pretty average but acceptable for a budget laptop like this. Its worth noting that there is absolutely no backlight bleed along the edges of the screen, nor is there any inconsistencies in the color - screen is highly uniform and consistent which is impressive.Perhaps the one thing that could be better is the range of brightness you have available with the screen. In full daylight, even at full brightness the screen looks pretty dim. For this reason, its probably not best for those who planning on using the laptop while outdoors or something like that.RAM comes stock at 12gb of 2400ghz memory. Plenty of memory for multitasking with tons of web browser tabs open at the same time. AMD Ryzen processor is full capable, although it tends to run hotter than its Intel counterparts, so you'll hear the fan turn on anytime you start doing any changes  to the settings while also doing other things.Battery life is decent, nothing to write home about at 6 hrs on average with moderate usage and less than full screen brightness.Built in ports are great, with one glaring omission - no USB-C port. These days its pretty rare to see a device without one so this ia pretty big bummer. Luckily ports that it does have include two USB-3.0 ports, one USB-2.0, an ethernet port, and an HDMI port.BOTTOM LINE:This is a very competent machine for those looking for a basic computer that offers full desktop functionality at a very affordable price. Overall compact, slim profile that looks as good as it is easy to take with you. Perhaps the best part about it is the keyboard with its 10-key number pad and easy to type on layout.","Dell Inspiron 15 3000 FHD 1080p, AMD Ryzen 5, 8GB Memory, 256GB SSD, AMD Radeon Vega 8 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Black",429,dell
190,RN,2021,4,Great mid-range for all-purpose use,"My youngest son had been using a 13"" MacBook that was our family spare, but didn't actually have his own computer even though that was essentially his.  He had to use it through most of the school year for distance learning throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and used it for playing games and keeping in tough on-line with his school friends.  During the last few months of school it started to have problems charging so we figured it was time to get him his own and one that would meet his needs better.We needed something that would be able to handle doing frequent zoom meetings, basic word processing,  school work, internet browsing, and yet still be able to handle things he enjoys like gaming with his friends.There's a lot of games he wanted to play but were not compatible with Apple systems so a Windows-based computer was ideal.  I checked out games I know he wanted to play from Steam and looked at their minimum system requirements and this laptop meets the minimum requirements for 100% of the games he owns and about 99% of those he has wishlisted.  He's played a number of games from Steam, GOG, and other places.  He's played games like Terraria, Dragon Ball FighterZ, NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 4, Genshin Impact, and Roblox and all of those have played wonderfully on this system with no problems.For schooling this system handled zoom meetings without issue, worked well Micorsoft Office and Google Classroom/Google Docs.  It handles browsers with many multiple tabs open without issue.  The wifi range is excellent and he can get a signal anywhere in our home (my older son has a gaming computer that a lot more than this and cant get a good signal everywhere like this one).  It has ample storage and decent ram along with a video card that seems to be very capable.He's able to hook up his various peripherals without any issues and so far this laptop seems to be able to do everything he needs and currently wants to do.  Will it run every major AAA game, no, probably not.  Is it VR capable, not even close.  Is it a good general all-purpose computer that's good for school/work and moderate gaming, absolutely!  I think the price is pretty reasonable for the specs and functionality of this laptop.","Dell Inspiron 15 3000 FHD 1080p, AMD Ryzen 5, 8GB Memory, 256GB SSD, AMD Radeon Vega 8 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Black",429,dell

I went from opening the package to using the laptop/on the internet in about fifteen minutes.The best thing about this laptop is the keyboard. It's not cramped and it has a full numeric keypad. As a 15 inch laptop, the machine isn't one of those tiny little mini-laptops where you have to sacrifice on the keyboard, but it's also not one of those 17-inch monsters that's not really very portable. It's a sweet spot.The trackpad is less than stellar. It's not bad, but it feels a little cheap. I guess I've been spoiled by glass trackpads on other machines in the past. The gestures work nicely though, and there's nothing wrong with it. It's basic.The other thing I don't love about this machine is that for some reason they didn't include even a single USB C port. In 2021, that's an odd choice because the writing is on the wall regarding legacy USB-A ports, even if these are 3.1.This isn't a workhorse - I mean it's good. 12 gigs of RAM with this processer is about the bare minimum to have a pleasant experience with Chrome these days, but more RAM would have been appreciated to future-proof it a bit more. It's also not a gaming PC by any stretch, but that's easily forgiven in a laptop.What I've written above doesn't mean that I think this is a bad laptop. It's good. It's not great.

193,Nicholas Calderone,2021,5,"Much nicer than the last Inspiron I had. All in all, a great laptop for students","First off, Amazon's system is suggesting I review the touchscreen. I'm guessing it's because people keep asking about it, this laptop does NOT have a touchscreen.The last time I had an Inspiron laptop was back in college and boy is this different. The plastic has been upgraded from cheap colorful gloss to a nice matte black. The laptop has a much nicer shape than the previous ones (maybe it's just the trend because components are better, but it's still a good reason to upgrade if you're carrying around the clunky old ones).For the price, it's got a great screen (also matte, something touchscreens are never offered with) and 12gb of ram rather than the standard 8 you'll see at the same price. It's quite light for its size thanks to the plastic body and the battery lasts plenty for what I'd do with it (mostly used in a classroom with students). I don't really do battery tests because they vary so much by use.The vega graphics are also plenty for games like valorant and league and the larger display (I'm used to 13"") makes media and games easier to take in.My one and only complaint, and it's one I can't stress enough, is that it uses ONLY a barrel jack for charging. I don't understand why companies don't just standardize with usb c. Everything else I have is, even the emergency light I leave in my car.  Standardized chargers make it so much easier to charge devices when I have multiple different types for students.","Dell Inspiron 15 3000 FHD 1080p, AMD Ryzen 5, 8GB Memory, 256GB SSD, AMD Radeon Vega 8 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Black",429,dell
194,Matt B,2021,4,Good all-around computer,"My daughter is about to graduate high school and I thought that a new laptop might be a nice graduation gift for her. This Dell seemed to be a good option for that purpose. I’ve had good experiences in the past with Dell laptops and this one has decent enough specs for her to be able to do most things with it. The laptop is slim and lightweight. It’s very easy to transport from place to place. To test it out, we’ve don’t a lot of basic productivity tasks along with some light gameplay. It’s a good all-around laptop and it’s very peppy for most tasks. The keyboard is very easy to use since it’s a full-size keyboard with a full numeric keypad. I like that this was able to be included without creating a giant laptop that was too large to be easily portable.Even though the laptop is a good machine there is one big modern option that is missing. There is no USB-C port included and that is a little bit of a bummer for us since we use quite a few other USB-C devices. The display isn’t a touchscreen either, but I can live without that. Some of the other reviews here state that this laptop doesn’t come with WiFi 6 and while again, that would be a nice bonus, it’s not a deal-breaker for me. It does only come with Bluetooth 4, which is pretty outdated. I do also wish the keyboard was backlit. That last thing is more of a creative comfort than anything else, but it would be a great feature to include.Overall, the laptop is a very good machine. It offers a lot of the same power and features as most desktop computers do, but it’s versatile and portable.

Inside the box, the padding for the laptop is molded, recyclable cardboard pieces. I'm pleased to see that they've taken care to make the packaging recyclable. Along with the laptop, is the power supply in two separate bags, and a quick start guide printed on a small fold-out sheet with lots of pictures. There is a QR code on the instruction booklet so you can use your phone to go directly to the support area on the Dell website and download the full manuals I'd expect. The laptop itself additionally comes packed in a plastic bag, probably to protect it from dust and such during shipping. When you open the laptop, there is a thin foam pad on the top protecting the screen from damage during shipping.The first thing I did was to plug it in to charge, to make sure that the charge was full on the battery. Then I'll go to their website using the QR code and take a look at the instructions. Once you find the support page for Inspiron 3505, just go to the documents and choose the one for setup. That'll take you through the setup step by step. Once you press the power button, it starts to finish the windows setup, and that will take you step by step, walking you through setting up your PC for the first time.It's been a while since I've set up a new PC, and it's interesting to note that now Cortana walks you through step by step for the setup. In addition to the older method of typing on the keyboard and clicking for all the responses, Cortana also can now give you a verbal walkthrough, asking you questions about your preferences and making changes based on what you tell it. Word of warning, factory default on the volume seems to be fairly high, so be prepared for the voice to be moderately loud. The setup also includes a subscription to McAfee antivirus. It's not my usual go-to for antivirus, but since it's included, I'll give it a shot. [I found out later that it's only a 30-day free trial, so I'll be taking that out and going back with Windows defender, which is free, and it works great]It appears that part of the setup also includes checking for any updates that have occurred since the computer was manufactured. Once I put in all of my setup info, it went to a black screen with the message let us take care of everything for you.Once the PC finished setting the up process since I provided my Microsoft login information, it logged me directly into my Microsoft account, and since I prefer my devices to sync, my screen was one of my backgrounds. The first thing I did was open the Dell application, which takes you to my Dell and asks you to set up an account. It appears that registering your Dell account also activates your warranty. [A couple of days later, I received an email from Dell support welcoming me to the Dell family and giving links to the most commonly asked questions, as well as explaining warranty options.]During the setup, I started hearing a jet sound, which I presumed was from a web page I was on. Nope. It was the cooling fan motor firing up for the first time. It's not overly loud, but it does have a quite noticeable volume at speed, sounded different from my older laptop and the sound surprised me a little. It's not so much a traditional fan sound, more like a gentle woosh continually running in the background.Checking out things on the new laptop, it seems that not all, or even close to all of the windows updates installed automatically when I first started the laptop. I'm running Windows updates now, there are at least 10 updates for different things that need to run, including a fairly large system update that took a few minutes, requiring several restarts. With any Windows computer, I recommend running Windows update manually at least once a week, as there are often updates that don't push automatically.In setting up my logins to the computer, evidently, this laptop does not support Windows hello face, it comes up with an error message saying, “Couldn't find a camera compatible with Windows hello face "" So, I guess that particular option is out for this laptop.The other biometric login option is a fingerprint scanner, which this laptop is equipped with. I was able to set up my fingerprint for login using windows security, but I have not been able to use that for a login. [Over several days of trying to use my fingerprint to log in, I was able to get it to start functioning. It appears that it's not entirely intuitive as to which part of your finger touches the button, for me, it was a little bit of a learning curve to touch it in just the correct manner.]The laptop also comes with a maintenance program called Dell support assist. it's not automatic, you have to run it manually. the first time I manually ran the support assist program, it found 7 driver updates that Windows update didn't cover.I installed the Netflix app from the Microsoft store because I like to watch a movie on the laptop once in a while, and I have to say playback on this machine is phenomenal! The wide full screen provides an excellent picture, and the speakers give a sound that's better than my TV at home. I don't know where they hid all that sound on this relatively small laptop body, but it's pretty great. The laptop also comes with an onboard program called Dell Cinema Guide, with which you can combine any and all streaming services that you subscribe so that you can watch everything in one spot.In using this laptop for my everyday tasks, I found that typing on the keyboard isn't a hundred percent accurate.  While I'm definitely not the world's best typist, I found that my fingers would slip off the keys and I had more mistypes than normal. Also, I'm not a touch typist and need to look at the keys every once in a while. While these keys indeed are printed clearly and easy to read, I think the keyboard would be better [as in easier to see] if it was backlit.","Dell Inspiron 15 3000 FHD 1080p, AMD Ryzen 5, 8GB Memory, 256GB SSD, AMD Radeon Vega 8 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Black",429,dell

197,Froggy707,2020,2,Chromebook Technically Works (That's the best I've got at the moment),"My experience:- Product arrived on time and obviously hand packed...but with very minimal effort to protect the computer during shipment. I received a cardboard (flat rate?) box with the Chromebook wrapped in a single layer of Styrofoam wrapping paper. Charger was in a gallon size zip lock bag. At this point I was expecting the worst, but determined to remain open minded.- Scratches and dings on all exterior surfaces of Chromebook (obviously NOT ""Like New"" condition as advertised). At this point I'm getting frustrated by the clearly misleading description of the product I purchased. But honestly, if the computer works, then do the exterior cosmetics really matter that much?- Opened the Chromebook and the screen is CRACKED. At this point, I'm definitely kicking myself for being a sucker. BUT, the screen cracks are in the black area to the top left of the actually screen viewing area. Maybe a screen protector will hold them in place and this will all just be a funny story one day. All is not lost yet...my optimism knows no bounds...- Plugged up the Chromebook and it took a very long time to load. But it did load! This is a working laptop that my middle-school kiddo can use for remote learning. I'm regaining my composure at this point. Gave the computer to the kiddo and forced myself to concentrate on other things.- That night, kiddo brings me the Chromebook and tells me that the battery isn't working. I ran a battery_test on the Chromebook and no battery was found. Opened up the computer and there is certainly a battery in this thing. No worries, this happens all the time. No telling what life this obviously not ""like new"" battery has had.- Called a local computer store and ordered a brand new battery for $50. Waited 5 days for the store to get my special ordered battery in, but it came as promised and is exactly what I needed. Came home, installed the new battery, and the Chromebook still does not work without a charger plugged in.- Long story short, I bought my kid a very used Chromebook (with a cracked screen) that is incapable of functioning as a laptop because it dies instantly if unplugged.2020 has been one heck of a year. In the grand scheme of things, this buying experience is just not even close to the top of my personal ""unexpected/ridiculous/horrible things that have happened"" list. So, I'm chalking this up to a live and learn experience. My kiddo has a computer that seems to be working at the moment and will do what it needs to for the upcoming remote learning marathon. That said, I've already started socking away what money I can in anticipation of the day that this thing completely craps out. I know, please try to contain your jealousy.I took pictures of the unboxing process and will upload soon...but not right now. Right now this Mama needs a large glass of some nice grape juice.","Dell Chromebook 11 CB1C13 11.6"" Laptop Intel Celeron 2955U 1.40GHz 4GB 16GB SSD",99,dell
198,Jordan Hatch,2021,5,Great Deal and Does the Job!,I purchased this my freshman year in college expecting it to last 6 months at most. It is now the middle of my third year and still running perfectly. At one point I spilled about 8 ounces of water on the keyboard and the trackpad stopped working so I purchased a $5 plug in mouse. That worked for a while and about 5 months later I tried the trackpad again and it was fully functioning.

199,Cash Burner,2021,2,Not worth it.,So I had to buy a new laptop for school and first I made an impulsive decision buying this thinking it was a Windows 10 laptop. I was surprised it was a Chrome book but I was ok with it since the price was fair. The seller who shipped this to me had a previous Google education profile still logged in. I had the courtesy to wipe any previous personal data and start out with a complete fresh new start.. It was ok at first until I started experiencing problems with turning on the laptop. I looked it up and I had a solution that temporarily fixed the issue. I then started having the same problem but all of the solutions I tried just wasn't working. Now it turns on at rare times even if I change the battery. It might just be a hardware problem but I would not recommend this if you absolutely need a laptop for work/school reasons.,"Dell Chromebook 11 CB1C13 11.6"" Laptop Intel Celeron 2955U 1.40GHz 4GB 16GB SSD",99,dell

252,K Alcaraz,2021,4,90% PERFECT!!,"I've always LOVED Dell Desktop computers. I've had several throughout many years. But I'd never heard anything about Dell laptops. Knowing that Dell makes the best desktops (in my opinion!), I decided to try the laptop. I couldn't believe how fast I fell in love with this laptop. I've had it for over a month now, using it for several hours each day & I have only found 2 problems with it:The color on the display is dull. Not the correct colors. I mean, I don't know the technical terms for all this, but it seems like the coloring that the display shows, is of low quality. It isn't HDR so it's kind of upsetting. I like to have brilliant color.The 2nd problem is the keyboard. The keys are cramped together so it's hard for me to type because I have big fingers. I usually type 95 wpm but on this keyboard I make so many mistakes that it's like I can't type at all!! I'd like the keys more spread out. All laptops seem to have cramped keys, but this one is worse.But, even with those 2 annoyances, I LOVE THIS DELL LAPTOP!!! The price for it was unbelievable! I'm only going to buy Dell's from now on. The customer service is Old School, which means they care. I will add to this in a couple of months so you can see that I will still love my Dell!!January 22, 2022 - I've had my Dell for almost 5 months now. Like I said, I STILL LOVE MY DELL!! I'm getting used to the keys a little bit but I bought a keyboard & attached it to my laptop & it works great. Like I said in my earlier review, Dell's are the best desktop computers, & now I can honestly say that they make the best laptops too. It's worth it to spend a little more because you'll have your Dell for WAY longer than any other brand.  Soooooo, to sum it all up, I LOVE MY DELL LAPTOP!!!

256,Lauren Nelson,2021,4,Serviceable Solution,"We were looking to get a second laptop as the pandemic had pushed both my partner and I to be working from home. We weren't looking for anything fancy, but we needed more oomph than a Chromebook. This Dell fit the bill. It's not going to wow you, but it's got enough power to support web browsing, doc and presentation creation, and graphic design programs all at once. It moves along at a nice clip, as well. It's not incredibly heavy, but it's certainly not designed as a ""lightweight"" solution. My one real complaint is that the mouse touchpad is awkwardly positioned and configured, which can slow me down while I'm trying to switch between applications.

259,Adrieee,2021,1,Unbelievably Slow & Not Even The Correct Model,"I ordered this laptop in June for a new job I started. I was to be working hybrid, home on Tues/Thurs and in the Office MWF. My old laptop was a janky Lenovo from college that just needed to go, so I did some digging and found this laptop. The reviews were solid, and the price wasn't steep at all so I went for the purchase.Worst. Mistake. Ever. When I say this laptop is slow, this laptop is SLOW. I've done every update possible, checked for out of date drivers and updated the ones that needed updating. I've installed software for security, and mostly use this laptop for work and my own personal work, so nothing dodgy is ever downloaded onto my laptop.It takes about 5-7 minutes for the initial log-in to load, another 7-10 minutes for the laptop to 'wake up' and what feels like 20 years to load apps, such as Chrome or what have you. Even while typing this review, the lag is just ridiculous. The cursor is currently stuck on the word 'even'........ and it's still stuck there.Just slow slow slow all around since day one of getting this laptop.Now here's the kicker... this week and next I'm working from home again, and I decided to check with Dell's website to see if there are any additional driver updates I can find. Now according to the Amazon listing for this laptop, this is a Dell Inspiron 3583. I went to the Dell support website and did a search for the Inspiron 3583, but the website said that this search didn't yield anything. I went to my Amazon orders to make sure I had the correct model, but again the search didn't bring anything up. SO, I put my laptop onto it's monitor to look at the model number that comes on the laptop.......... the laptop I received is AN INSPIRON 3502!?!? Can you say false advertising?????? I'll definitely be filing a complaint with Amazon.Do yourself a favor, and just skip onto the next laptop if you were considering purchasing this one. I've seen other reviews mentioning just how slow this laptop is, and they are absolutely correct. If you have a 5hr work day, you'll be waiting 7hr just to get this thing slightly up and running. Definitely not a recommended product.",Dell Inspiron 3583 15” Laptop Intel Celeron – 128GB SSD – 4GB DDR4 – 1.6GHz - Intel UHD Graphics 610 - Windows 10 Home - Inspiron 15 3000 Series - New,279,dell

Keyboard is also fine for travel, which again I supplement at home with separate key board.  Could have used more ports but extension ports seem work fine.  I am not a Google fan so the Microsoft suite (Excel, Word, Outlook, etc.) work fine for me - although Edge I am not crazy about.

Just ran one command.  Rebooted and set bios.  Was good to go.  This laptop has an older version of TPM than Windows 11 would prefer, but was only yellow on Windows 11 pre-check.

337,ManofSteelo,2022,5,"So Far, So Great","Have had this about six weeks now, and couldn't be more pleased, overall. Familiar with Dell laptops because of my work computer (5500), and so when I needed a new home laptop, going Dell was a no-brainer.Overall, this device is fantastic, and certainly offers a great alternative to using my Android smartphone for emails and internet browsing; handles Microsoft Office and Adobe products with ease and aplomb also. Windows 11 upgrade arrived about 2 weeks after I set the computer up -- have not had any problems using that OS since installing it then.By no means am I a hardcore user, but it's nice to know that I have the gigs and the vid quality in the chamber, so to speak, if and when needed. Price keeps fluctuating here, so that might be a minor deterrent along with the relatively poor lighting on the screen (my 5500 is much brighter, and it's a 2019). But en toto, this is a can't-miss purchase for those folks who can keep their personal computing lives separate from their work ones.

The screws come loose and if you are not watching, it will damage the plastic around the monitor. I leave my computer on a desk. When I do travel with it, I carry it in a padded laptop case. After 5 months of gentle use, this should not be a problem. I'm shipping it off to Dell for a repair. Technically I'm still under Basic warranty but we know they will still charge me for it.

394,University Doc,2022,2,Great at 1st. Touchpad died less than 4 mos of use....,"I was excited to get this new laptop. Not that I wanted one, but Microsoft makes one buy one with Windows 11: I began having issues with my Windows 10 laptop since Windows 11 was announced. 1st, thanks to a local delivery company, delivery was very late on this laptop. Very late and when calling them, they had no idea what was going on. When we contacted Off--- --x, they had no idea what was going on either and didn’t even care. In fact, if we didn’t phone the delivery company, it would never have been delivered. O----- --x was no help in tracking or getting this laptop to us. Shame on O---- --x. A helpful supervisor did take the time to give us a credit but couldn’t do anything else.  I do love the speed of the laptop. It is quite fast. The speakers are lousy. Even on highest level, it is low and tinny. Horrible for a laptop like this. I have two older laptops that have better speakers. However, the biggest con with this laptop is its lack of durability and reliability. Within just 3-1/2 months of use, the touchpad and mouse failed. Can't use it. Through remote testing Dell made the diagnosis that it failed and informed me that they would send me a replacement per the warranty. I am to send the broken one back or have to pay for it. After waiting a week, I checked on Dell.com to find out the status. No status showed and all I could find was, ""Resolution Pending"". What does that mean? I have no idea. Just how long am I supposed to wait to get a replacement part? I can’t use the laptop without it. I don’t like the touchscreen. I would think under warranty the replacement part would have been shipped out directly. No need to say how very disappointed I am in this purchase. The price at the time I purchased in in late February 2022 seemed reasonable. After this, all I can say that it was and is now still overpriced. Save your money and purchase another brand. And I miss having a CD/DVD recorder/player. As with everything else, size shrinks and prices go up. Overall, this purchase was a big nightmare: from the lousy shipping company; Do----- shipping of Jackson, MS to the failed touchpad/mouse, and lack of efficient warranty service and response.

405,ppa,2022,4,I highly recommend this touchscreen laptop,"I purposely included the word touchscreen in the title because it is a “touchscreen” laptop. I’ve seen some confusion about that in some of the comments. This is a “touchscreen” laptop. I purchased the brand-new version. Used ones are being sold. I bought the new computer. Now be-clear: this is a highly exceptional deal. Value for the money in my opinion is beyond comparison. 16 GB of ram, 128 SSD Drive with one terabyte of HDD, touchscreen tablet, 15.6 inch screen - this is an amazing deal for the price. It’s fast, very very very fast. That’s because of the 16 GB of RAM and the SSD drive. If you don’t know about SSD drive, you want that. It makes the computer Boot up much faster.  This computer actually has two hard drives. It uses the SSD to Boot Up and store data, it’s a solid component and boot up is amazingly fast  it also has 1 TB HDD This computer will last me a very long time. Before I made my purchase I had looked at (I.e., studied for months ) several different Dell laptops. I have an older Dell laptop, it needed replacing. It did not qualify gor Windows 11 upgrade and was getting slower by the hour.  For the speed, the ram, the duel drives, and all of the storage this compares verifiably to the XPS class of dell computer. This laptop comes with Windows 10, but upgrades to Windows 11 upon setup. Computer will remind you to run all the updates for the Dell computer. Once the computer is set up you will see a prompt make sure you run them. Anyway, I strongly recommend purchasing this computer. This is an excellent price for a very very very good computer. Frankly, this is a steal. I’m not a Dell or Amazon employee - just an Amazon prime customer that’s very happy with this purchase of my new laptop. I highly recommend this computer.

407,Amazon Customer,2022,3,Poor performance from the unit and Dell support,"First of all, this review is for my specific model, 2.8GHz I5, SSD+Mech drive, no touchscreen, Amazon combines similar product reviews.  This product had either systemic problem or was defective leading to poor performance, and it was returned.  The nitty gritty is below, but the executive summary is the processor was locked at 0.4GHz, one sixth it's rating.  Imagine buying a Ferrari capable of 240 MPH, and when it arrived it was governed to 40MPH.  I was hoping to work through the issues with dell, but when they turned the tables asking for payment to support a brand new unit, i thought they deserved it back.I spent about 10 hours trying to fix this.  I narrowed it down to the processor thinking it was dissipating 85 watts, which would be a remarkable feat, since the power adapter is only 65 watts.  The speedshift power saving in the chip figures it would be burning up (even though the temps were fine), so it throttled to min speed.  When I was ready to give up I figured I'd call dell.  The level one tech did find a driver or two that the update drivers tool did not find, and he installed them over a period of 90 minutes.

442,Question&TheAnswer,2012,4,Refurbished Dell Latitude D620,"I truly give this a 3 1/2 star rating. I'll tell you the Pros and Cons, and what the computer is and isn't made for. I wanted a new Laptop for the online marketing I do since I thought my Toshiba A205 was done for. The shipping from ABCcomputers was fast and everything they said the computer was, was valid information. I was ready to go back to Windows XP OS with the Dell, but decided to install Vista in it instead. The battery and charger worked very well to my surprise lasting well over 2 hours and there were very few cosmetic scratches. Yet the one thing that I cannot get over about the computer was how dim the screen was. I have doubts that all Dell D620 screens come that dark, but it seems as though it's always on a power saving mode for battery life like a typical laptop. It's a slight annoyance, but I believe I can live with it, and I can say this was the greatest of all problems I had with the computer.ABCcomputers described it as a powerful laptop despite it's 1GB RAM memory, 1.65GHz Dou Core Processor and only 80GB HDD memory. To my surprise it was a work horse! Here's the twist, I replaced the 80GB Seagate Hard Drive with an 128GB Solid State Drive in the Dell and could start maybe 10 applications all at the same time including 3 web browsers with practically no application effecting the others performance. Here's another twist; when I found out what was wrong with my Toshiba (a newer computer than the refurbished Dell), I switched the Solid State Drive to the Toshiba that had 2GB RAM, and 1.85 GHz Duo Core Processing. In this experiment, I found the applications sometimes load a few seconds slower than instantly like in the D620. I actually encountered some freezing of applications I had to force close in the Toshiba. This never happened when the SSD was in my Dell D620! I still kept the SSD in the Toshiba because of how bright and wide screened it was over the Dell. Besides, the SSD works good enough in the Toshiba.The computer's processing seems very good with it's original Seagate Harddrive. I really don't know what you can ask for more out of a refub Dell from 2006. This Dell's focus was primarily as a business computer so Word Processing is ideal. I was planning on upgrading the Dell even more by putting in 4 GBs of RAM as it only has 1GB. Before anything my main focus is getting that backlighting brighter as Fn + the UP arrow key does not do the trick. I'm sure that would cost at least over $100, and right now that's too much of an investment out of this secondary computer. At the same time the computer can only use 3.5GB out of the 4GB of RAM because of the BIOS blocking it or 32 bit OS you're using. Either one is the case but I'm not %100 sure. The D620 is not a light computer even though the screen width is just 14 inches wide. They made it pretty sturdy with a Strike Zone feature that probably helps keep your hardware and cpu denying damage.It's not at all a Gaming PC. A video card / whole new motherboard has to be put inside of it just to recognize a newer Microsoft game. So, sorry gaming geeks, you'll have to pay probably another hundred dollars if you wanna play Skyrim and your other favorite games. Gaming wouldn't be exceptional anyway, since the screens brightness isn't top resplendent or enchanting.Concluding my own personal story, I now have a secondary laptop that I'll probably just store files on such as music for I Tunes, and maybe in the future video file, and probably do some web browsing. I think its a good PC, but I would like to know what others feel about their Latitude's backlighting. Comment because I wanna know. It's a decent computer, but I think it would be well worth the $200 if it didn't hurt my eyes to watch lol. Other than that problem I would recommend someone buying this computer and upgrading it as they go making it a super computer like I did.",Dell D620 Laptop Duo Core with Windows XP,132,dell
443,Beli,2015,4,Would not recommend,"UPDATE: After updating the drivers and disabling the ""pointing stick,"" my previous issue with the cursor disappeared.It has now been one week since, and the problems have not returned. So seeing that the problem was fixed at no additional cost to me, I'm changing my rating from 1 to 4 stars. I recently discovered that the battery only holds its full charge for approx. 1-3 minutes (depending on brightness and open applications) when i attempted to unplug it and take it to another room. I''m not sure if the battery issue is a new development or not, as I rarely use the device unplugged. If not for the battery problem; I'd have given it 5 stars.Initial Review (July 2015):I purchased this laptop to use I'm my business to run office management software back in February. About 4-5 weeks after starting to use it I noticed that at times the cursor would occasionally jump to the upper right or lower left hand corner of the screen. I was usually able to move it back to where I needed it and I ignored what I considered a minor issues... But as the months have passed, thus problem has become much worse. The cursor now goes to the bottom or top of the screen and slides from left to right. I am powerless to stop it. Using a usb mouse does nothing as the problem seems to be coming from either the touchpad or the ball pointer. I'm at my wits end with this problem. I've just started pulling up my patient files for this afternoon and the touchpad has simply stopped working. The ball pointer will only moved left and right but whatever is ring will pull it back to the right hand corner of the screen. I feel like this was a waste of money and a huge inconvenience as I now have to find a way to transfer my records to another computer and as a less than techno savvy person. Im not sure how to go about doing that without the use of the mouse. I googled this issue today and found out that it is a common problem with this model. So BUYER BEWARE!!! I wish I would have read a review like this one before purchasing this laptop. Ill now have to seek proffessional help with this problem (for the sake of saving important records) which will no doubt cost me more than the laptop itself. I suppose I should have been wary of the price in the first place.",Dell D620 Laptop Duo Core with Windows XP,132,dell
444,Christopher Nathan,2016,5,"This process, value and reliability supersedes any Craigslist nightmare hands down!","If you are looking for an awesome reliable laptop when you are traveling, this is the one. Old school laptops cannot be beat by any means, especially a Dell as they hold their value like trucks. Yes, it has XP, but XP is reliable and not a resource hog unlike Windows10. I am moving out of state and need a stable laptop for school. I am also a computer techie and have been around the block millions of times with every computer and operating systems available to the world which is not many at all. I am extremely happy with the service I received and the value of this particular laptop. It is a beast that will not let me down in my needs. Even though, standard delivery is the only option, I needed the laptop before my moving date. I emailed the seller and they responded in a timely manner to confirm shipment. I ordered this on Monday and received it on Thursday midday. It is a very 'clean' laptop. Meaning, the shell is not beat up by any means but gently used. I would not be surprised if parts like the screen and keyboard were replaced because it looks new. The Windows XP OS is a very 'cleaned' up operating system, meaning there is no useless programs and junk. There is a couple extra programs like CCleaner and Malwarebytes that these guys installed which is very useful in case of need because XP is not supported anymore so you will not be able to get updates. Support ended April 2014. You might encounter issues with installing programs that have or will no longer support XP but the initial program will still install and work like Spotify.  It is superfast with great response time on multitasking. Everything is as stated in the sellers description. I run my internet resource off of easytether and support for LGV10 was flawless. An external wireless mouse is an essential with laptops in my opinion. The battery is expected to not completely hold the charge for a great length of time. If you understand that logic, then you understand the purpose. Unplugged is a very short temporary solution. After all, this is an old school laptop.  Keep the ac adapter plugged in when you can and you will be just fine.  If I ever need a laptop again, I will definitely be coming back to this exact spot.

445,Brandon Lee Malcore,2015,5,Epic for me anyways.,For budget Gamer I found this laptop to be great for league of legendes. (With upgraded RAM to 4 gigs of ram) being capable to run windows 7 32 bit and 64 bit.Video: The graphics are integrated so its simple. It can run hearthstone and leauge without a problem.Sound: I can't say I like the sound on the device. I use a speaker so its working out for me but without it its hard to a lot to be honest.Speed: like I stated before the 2.0 gigs that it comes with can still do the job for the games I play and the videos I watch whilst using only one of the programs but with the upgrate its fantastic.Battery: Another downside to be hosnet it does heat up quickly and if your a gamer like me you know that if you have it unplugged windows ussaly goes into a power saving mode that slows it down significantly. So giving the battary a break from time to time is ideal.As far as non gaming pursues such as surfing the internet and what not. It runs quite well. But you'll have to upgrade your browser for some sites because windows XP is no longer supported by Microsoft. I use firefox for the best performance.You can of course upgrade to windows 7 32 bit and use windows internet explorer 11 but Windows XP doss not run it.All in all if you know your way around a a personal computer this buy is a steal and a great device if upgraded.I love it already.Oh and john the service Representative was also vary awesome for getting shipped to me faster.Thanks John!,Dell D620 Laptop Duo Core with Windows XP,132,dell
446,Ngirilover,2012,4,Great Computer Great Price...Tampa the Best,"I believe that I have now bought 3 or 4 refurbished computers from Tampa Laptops.  They have all been Dell's with Windows XP operating systems.  The people for whom I have bought these computers are educated poor people in sub-Saharan Africa where computer viruses regularly take down laptops.  These computers have held up well.  They are reasonably quick, and with a good virus protector on them and some instruction about scanning and keeping the virus protector up to date, the people for whom I have gotten these computers have been very happy.  One thing that has helped a great deal is the one on one assistance that I have received from Tampa.  I have always reached a human being there when I call to ask a question.  They have replaced batteries for me that were dead, and they have helped me to understand what additions I need on these computers. While the hard drives are not huge, they are fine for starter computers...especially student computers. My understanding is that the XP system still rates as the best for PC's and this is certainly what my African friends have told me.Their prices are very competitive, and again, their service is terrific.  I'm very sorry they are no longer on Amazon Prime, but I will always buy refurbished computers from Tampa. (I am a Mac person myself-so Tampa, start working on them, too!)",Dell D620 Laptop Duo Core with Windows XP,132,dell
447,Amazon Customer,2021,4,A good deal for the price.,"It's  a decent refurbished laptop, there's a loose letter key, and the power cord has some slight separation at the cord/plug joint,  but these are issues I can handle  easily.

If you can get by doing a little cleanup on your own in my opinion you are getting a reasonably good working refurbished unit.Maybe when you place your order you can tell them in the comments section you need  a clean working unit.Perhaps one of the other sellers may give you a cleaner unit but I do know that I have a laptop that arrived fully functional.Cosmetics gets a ""D"".

449,taylor,2012,4,Dell laptop,"The pros:  this is a good & clean computer with wifi and the company sent it in a good time frame.  I had just planned to buy a new laptop but an unexpected illness, bad economy, no job, a computer repair that would cost more than buying another computer and living in a rural community all left me in bad shape. I'm glad to have found a good computer under $200.  The cons: a lot of drivers were outdated as well as the windows xp updates (109) and the battery was dead so I had to buy a new one.  My personal problem was I couldn't do any updates so my usb internet modem wouldn't work.  Since I live rural and the closest wifi is 30 miles one way at McDonald's (their wifi is very slow) I couldn't afford to stay very long and it took me a long time to update my system.  I saved up for a mifi hotspot and had to save up for the prepaid card at $40.00 a month.  So that's why it has taken me so long to reply.

450,"Rebel""K""",2013,5,Don't miss out on a good thing!!,"Being an Mac person since 82, I was kind of leery buying a PC, especially a used one.  After checking out the products on Amazon I settled for the Dell 620 (630) since it had the speed and power I need for my online job.  The computer had a very good price for the performance it offered, and although I did not expect a whole lot in the looks department, I was pleasantly surprised when I unpacked it a couple of days later.  The item looks as if it had never been used and i would challenge anyone to tell it apart from a new one. It ran right out of the box, and I actually like it, even if I still use mainly my Ibook 4G.  After adding my own sofware  which optimizes the whole system it is now perfect. Wify runs at 12mps which is more than enough to download full movies in a matter of minutes.  It also improved my productivity since the work pops up on the screen almost instantly.  All in all I am very pleased with this product, the service I received, and the customer care offered by Tampa Laptops.  I would recommend them to anyone looking for a used laptop at a more than fair price, and a seller that cares about their customers.  I am still an Apple man, but the PC from Tampa Laptop will be by my side, and my new work horse.",Dell D620 Laptop Duo Core with Windows XP,132,dell
451,Kindle Customer,2015,5,Great model. Keeps in the market after years of Dell not building them.,"Thanks for selling me this laptop. I had another one (same brand and model) but my board died (it was fair after buying it already used and using it hard for a couple of years). So I just used the one I bought here, replaced the hard drive, and it has been working great for about a year.  I upgraded to WINDOWS 10 and it is now working EVEN BETTER!!!!!!I had it updated with all the memory it can get (I think is just 2 GB) and a 1 TB hard drive. But they even sell solid state hard drives for this tough guy. I but a battery replacement every 2 years. It is completely inexpensive. This is a tough, robust, laptop. I am a developer at a major tech company in Seattle, and I use this laptop for my personal self-experimenting. Also I am a Phd student at a top-20 USA university, and this is the computer where I develop, test and show my research to my advisers and colleagues (I do weather computational modeling over non-sql mongo databases) and I run this stuff when riding a bus. So, this laptop IS good.Dell. Please. Make a successor for this model. Current ""successors"" are just big tablets with keyboard. They are social-media computers.

452,Joel Kitchen,2013,5,Great Machine,"Now, understanding this isn't a I7 machine, it has been great. Everything ran right off and no bloatware to deal with, no wifi problems. The hard drive that I got isn't 80 meg but 150, can't beat that. And I like XP. Sure, it isn't supported anymore, but then I don't do things (like go to places that are notorious for virus like porn sites, or open any extensions) that put me at risk (and just smile when people tell me about their problems with Windows 8). Looking around I note that to upgrade to 4gig is about $60, but at the moment there hasn't been a reason. The seller might do it for you with a call, haven't tried. Been having fun playing the original Mass Effect with no problems, mostly I just run internet, play audio books, and watch movies. Only 2 usb ports, but hey, it's cheap to get usb extensions. I'm really enjoying this machine at this price. I note that a lot of people write about the shipping container. Mine was just a USPS box, but it was well wrapped in bubble wrap, don't think there would have been any problems. I am considering getting another for my goddaughter. Finally, this isn't a problem for me but future buyers should note that there isn't a recovery disk, so if you die, you die. BACK UP :)",Dell D620 Laptop Duo Core with Windows XP,132,dell

Ok, to start off I have to say I am pleased to say that even though the laptop I received turned on with Windows 7 Professional.... it does have a setting to switch back to XP if need be....However I put in my software that said it was compatible up to windows XP and crossed my fingers....Program downloaded and installed with no problems...Runs fast...WiFi capability and also mine has four USB ports...Happy Camper for $45...I would suspect that it s great for personal needs that don't dwell on high graphics, but for the price great for college students and teem papers and simple gamers....Hope my review helped.",Dell D620 Laptop Duo Core with Windows XP,132,dell
454,Joe S,2016,5,The laptop was in very nice condition but it all started with a major hiccup,The laptop was in very nice condition but it all started with a major hiccup.  The AVG anti virus came up almost immediately after I got thing somewhat configured.  It told me there was a virus on the computer.  It asked if I wanted AVG to remove the virus and I chose this option.  I got on the internet and the AVG anti virus warned me that the same virus was detected again.  I chose to have it removed.  Almost immediately I got a voice message/warning that my files had been encrypted and links were provided to get me where I should go to pay ransom for my files.  Since I had nothing at all on the computer at this point I chuckled to myself about their timing.  I immediately contacted the seller about this issue and told them this was not acceptable.  They promptly sent me another hard drive all loaded with Windows XP(what I had wanted when I bought the laptop) and ready to go.  The whole transaction started on rocky footing but the seller quickly resolved the problem and I am a very happy camper.,Dell D620 Laptop Duo Core with Windows XP,132,dell

It has 4 USB ports but one of them was damaged so I only have 3 working USB ports which is sufficient for my kid's needs.  She watches a lot of online rerun TV programs.  For $175 it was not worth sending back.  Battery life good.  Slight scratches on the cover but is expected for a used laptop.  It was WiFi ready and it was easy to set up to our home wireless.

After verifying that the D620 worked properly by connecting to the internet and installing XP SP 3, I moved over one of the RAM chips (for a total of 1.5 GB) and the harddrive from the HP.  I then installed Windows 7 and recovered her data files (I didn't really expect a college student to use the flash drives that I gave her for backups). Finally, I installed software including Office 7.  Throughout the process the D620 performed flawlessly.  I tested it by running DVDs, Office apps and videos over the internet (after I set up a wireless connection).  This is one fine notebook, very fast and with a good display.  Its only ""short comings"" are obvious from the specs, i.e., no web cam, no media slots and no DVD burner.

My only problem with this laptop is that it is running Windows XP which Microsoft has stopped supporting and many websites will not let you in because this os is outdated. That being said this laptop is compatible with Windows 7 and maybe even Windows 8 you just have to do an upgrade. The upgrade can be tricky and is costly but worth it if you use the internet a lot.

You leave yourself open to malware and viruses by keeping XP on there. This machine CAN be upgraded to Windows 7, 8, or 8.1. The specs are good enough. But it is an older machine, leaving me wondering whether it's worth it to buy the new OS or just invest in a newer laptop.

The bottom line is I purchased a Dell Restore disk from the seller and I received the very best Technical Support I could have asked for.  James in their Technical Support Team, was patient, thorough, had a great speaking voice and he didn't quit until I got my laptop working again.  That's incredible support, the PC is amazing again, and I would 100% recommend this product to anyone who wants to buy a laptop and I would 100% recommend the seller.

Sparkles,2014,1,Treat others the way you would like to be treated,"This company enclosed a letter with this laptop asking for a 5 star rating stating there customers were important to them and asked to contact them first with an issue. Alas I cannot comply. I have not contacted them as I don't see a reasonable resolution to my issue. This laptop is virtually worthless to me as when I received it in July, I instantly received a prompt when turning it on. It said that windows XP will no longer be supported after that very month, July of 2014. I would have to upgrade to windows 8.1 or expect to be targeted by a virus. I subsequently found out it would cost me around $230.00 to buy the upgraded software and have it installed. So this deal was no deal at all. If this company had been forth coming about this issue in the write up I certainly would not have purchased it. I'm normally a Mac girl and this windows issue was unknown to me. So there ya go... Stuck with a worthless laptop unless I want to go through the ordeal of trying to return it, at my cost, PLUS that ridiculous made up meant to take more of your money 'restocking fee'. In my opinion this company is not above board. Anyone can give lip service in a letter, but we know ye by your actions. Or in my case lack there of.

The only issue I have is the seller(Open Electronics) specifically, in all capital letters, said the screen had no dead pixels but it has several. They also said , in all capital letters that there are no bad sectors. Since the screen has dead pixels I am skeptical about the lack of bad sectors.Over all I am mostly satisfied with the purchase.

The laptop is just fine and serves its purpose -- it was a Christmas gift to our teenage daughter who is aspiring to be a writer.  What impressed me here was the customer service we received.  After receiving the laptop, we had a little problem with it, so I posted a question to the seller through the Amazon site and received, not only a response, but a personal phone call from Jeremy --- on the same day that I posted the question!  Jeremy was very easy to work with and clearly puts customer service at the top of his list :)  Did I mention that phone call he made to us was while he was on vacation during Christmas?

I created DOS partition on harddrive because my obsolete program was DOS based, but then I discovered that the program worked very well from Windows XP also. I had very bad experience before running my obsolete program on laptops so I simply did not expect such great compatibility! Besides this I use the laptop for my high definition video, which requires a powerful computer. The video runs very smoothly with really high quality. The battery also is very good.

That's what I discovered but only after being a long ways into the setup.  Already had personal info on the machine, set up for email, etc.  After call to Dell [who was not the 3rd party seller, so had no control over this listing] determined this laptop never had one installed coming off the assembly line.  Contacted Amazon who initially offered refund/exchange but I was really reluctant to do that, first of all because I would have had to scrub this one of personal information and second because they couldn't tell me if the missing drive was a one time occurrence or whether all of them being sold by this vendor were without.  Finally they offered me a partial refund to cover the value of the missing drive.  I opted for that and ordered one [refurb] from Dell that I can install.Having said all that, we like the machine and have no other issues at this point other than discovering Windows 10 has eliminated the Homegroup function so I had to do some research on how to connect to our home networked printer.

It can easily be turned off by going into Settings, Update and Security, Activation, and clicking where it states ""Turn off S Mode."" You will need a Microsoft account in order to do this as you have to download it from the Microsoft Store. Once you do this, you can restart the unit and it will display Windows 10 Home with a fully activated license. We purchased a large number of these to use for my company and it is severely annoying that I have to do these steps to each individual one.Touch screen feels cheap but it does function. I am not thrilled with the LCD-like touchscreen, definitely does not feel sturdy and I am worried that overuse will eventually lead to damages. The seller should be more descriptive in their products but alas, I have no further complaints. It is a fast little machine and installed the updates in a matter of minutes, relatively large updates as well. I was quite impressed with that.

I have only used the touchscreen a few times, so am learning it's not a priority/necessity for me... maybe if the monitor swiveled so it was more like a tablet? Still a cool feature. I have struggled with the touchpad being slightly off center, so I end up hitting the right-click when I mean to left-click, or my palm touches the pad and messes with the mouse. Also, the keys on the board are about halfway up the keyboard, and spread out. Took a long time to get used to this layout. Most recently I discovered that this laptop doesn't have a cd rom! I didn't even know to look to make sure that it did have one! I thought it was a basic laptop function, but I hear more and more laptops are being created without them. Apparently cd drives allow a lot of dust inside the computer, and often lead to internal errors. External cd/dvd drives can be purchased for pretty cheap.For the most part this is a great laptop- it's just taking some getting used to!

500,HR,2021,1,Hinge and Screen fell apart after 18 months and had to replace the keyboard - Over $900 spent,"I did not realize that this model did not include a DVD drive so I had to buy one. After less than 18 months, I noticed the right hinge was popping out. That lead to me calling Dell and they were of no use, etc. and wanted $160 to analyze it. I called a local computer tech and that led to needing to replace the keyboard. Now I am faced with not being able to close the lid as the hinge issue has caused the screen to fall apart and separate. I have no idea what the repair will be this time and am faced with having to pay for an extensive body repair or buy a replacement computer. I do not recommend this product or if you do buy it, pay for the extended warranty. I have owned this computer since Dec 2018 and have already put more than $200 into it.April 5, 2021 Update: Today's repair was an additional $265. The tech had to replace the laptop body and said that he has never seen such brittle plastic in his 20 years of experience. Not only did all the little rivet's fall out, but three of the hinge screws were broken out of the plastic. What was even more depressing was that the replacement body's screen is not a touch screen as I had before. Overall, do not buy this unit. I have owned or possessed at least 16 Dells over the years via business and personal use. I am not down on Dell, but this laptop really stinks. I have over $900 invested in this laptop now.

It's still very heavy in the order of old school laptops.  However, it's processes fast.  Mine is not a touch screen laptop.  Another thing that I wanted to know but the seller didn't list in the ad is MS Office installed.  Yes, but I've read reviews that it's a trial. I've not received a notice yet that it's a trial version. Also, it has McAfee protection. I'm not sure if that is a trial version or not.  Seller, these are the two things I'd suggest you ad to the ad so that potential buyers know this upfront and are not having to guess.Other than, the order arrived on time as promised. I recommend this seller but do hope they put more relevant information in the ad about the software installed.  This would be helpful to the average purchaser who are not tech nerds. We'd like to know what's installed, if it's a trial version or not, etc.  If the ad had this information and I missed it, I apologize.  Maybe it should be featured more prominently because I searched and searched, prior to making this purchase, and didn't see the information upfront. I didn't have the time to postpone making a purchase until I posted a question and then wait around until someone decides to answer.

Nothing fancy which meets the needs.  Not an SSD as I opted for more storage at the lower price point.  No DVD but an inexpensive external one does the job on the rare need.  No touch screen but that 'feature' is really pointless on this class of PC.  Just a decent & reliable workhorse that Dell sells.  I definitely would NOT recommend any locked down Windows S package.  The included & eventual upgrade to Windows 11 will be pursued at some point.  I can recommend this PC at the lower end price, disk space, processor, memory, o/s plus previous good experiences with Dell systems over many years in business use and now in good ole retirement.","2021 Newest Dell Inspiron 15 3000 Series 3501 Laptop, 15.6"" FHD Non-touch, 11th Gen Intel Core i3-1115G4 Processor, 8GB RAM, 1TB Hard Disk Drive, Webcam, HDMI, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Windows 10 Home, Black",479,dell

Thinking perhaps she needed help, I tried to use it as well, but it is extremely slow to use websites that I use daily such as MS365 and browsing new websites.I asked my son who is a programmer and he said that one of the base capabilities - maybe it is the RAM - is already at capacity to run the native programs of the computer, so when we tax it with a new website, it slows down.Looked into purchasing a solution for this computer, but when he priced it out, it seems that we might as well purchase a new computer. Am frustrated because it seems we flushed $500+ down the toilet.The large screen is a plus though...Would really appreciate if the company would swap this one out.","2021 Newest Dell Inspiron 15 3000 Series 3501 Laptop, 15.6"" FHD Non-touch, 11th Gen Intel Core i3-1115G4 Processor, 8GB RAM, 1TB Hard Disk Drive, Webcam, HDMI, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Windows 10 Home, Black",479,dell

I called the repair center and within about two weeks, a repair man came to the house after ordering the replacement keyboard and had it fixed  within a couple of hours. It worked ok for several weeks and then I went to shut it down and restart it and it would never turn on again. I looked up , on my old computer several possible issues and things to try but sadly nothing offered a solution . I wound up having to sent it back for a refund that had almost a 100 dollar 'restocking ' fee attached to it. I have used Dells in the past for my job but this issue  has changed my mind about their laptops .

548,Jesse Adams,2020,5,Excellent,"This laptop is perfect for my work. I needed a laptop with a finish that could take a bit of abuse and won't show off scratches and prints prominently. The matte black, textured finish does exactly that.The touchscreen is a wonderful feature because I'm not completely adept with the touch pad. It makes it easier to navigate hard to get to forms and links. Unfortunately, the screen is a high gloss which will show off every print, scratch and abrasion it may suffer from. It seems counter intuitive for a touchscreen monitor though it's easily solved by placing a matte screen protector on it which everyone will end up doing anyhow.It's very slim, light weight and I like that very much. The 15.6"" screen is a dream! It definitely gives you the impression that the laptop is high quality and let's you enjoy watching videos and movies with confidence.

550,Doc Smith,2021,1,Big Disappointment and Failure,"I bought this laptop for one reason....so my isolated 87 year old mother could have contact with her children during COVID. I spent much time researching what computer would be the best for video conferencing--specifically on Zoom. So two of the most important things required on this laptop were quality built-in mic and webcam. It also needed to be reliable and easy to use. I could not be there in person to handle any tech issues for my mother so I needed to have confidence everything would work. The very first time she connected on Zoom, we realized the built in mic was crap. We could barely her voice when she would start talking, then it would get louder, then faded in and out. (I learned after additional research many others have had this some issue) She had an external mic, so she plugged that in and it worked, so I let that issue go. Everything was fine until today, Easter Sunday. I was looking forward to a Zoom meeting with my son and mother, but learned my mother's Dell was slow as molasses and after an update, her built in webcam no longer worked on Zoom. After an hour of trying to trouble shoot with her and even having my son who is an IT professional living outside the country work with her, determined there is something seriously wrong with the laptop. My mother lives 360 miles away from me and I'm not sure what I can do to help her at this point. This was supposed to be a reliable computer excellent for video conferencing with awesome mic and webcam. So instead of Easter Sunday ending with an awesome virtual get-together with my loved ones, I am now stressed, in tears, and angry.

553,laurie b,2021,1,Screen Defective & Blue Screen,"This is my 2nd purchase of this model. The first laptop was great, but this one blue screened twice within the month I’ve owned it.  The computer repaired itself both times, but a day or 2 after the 2nd blue screen the monitor stopped working correctly. There were vertical and horizontal lines and crooked ones too. It looks like there is liquid behind the screen when I powered it down.Customer service online chat and to the call center said I dropped the screen and it was obviously cracked from the pic I uploaded. After trying to explain numerous times that it only looks cracked when the monitor is on. When turned off there are no cracks, but both reps refused to deal with me and didn’t want to see another pic. Finally I asked for a manager explaining the screen problem and he sent a prepaid box to ship it to their repair center. He did state that if I cracked or dropped the unit  then they will not fix it, but if they find it is a hardware problem they will repair it for free under their warranty. I also explained that I purchased accident insurance when I purchased the laptop, but I’m not claiming it as an accident, because it was just sitting in my bed when the screen went wonky. Now the screen won’t turn on at all. I will update and give more stars if Dell honors their hardware warranty.","2021 Newest Dell Inspiron 15 3000 Series 3501 Laptop, 15.6"" FHD Non-touch, 11th Gen Intel Core i3-1115G4 Processor, 8GB RAM, 1TB Hard Disk Drive, Webcam, HDMI, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Windows 10 Home, Black",479,dell

592,Catherine,2022,5,"A decent, inexpensive laptop. Good for what I do.","I'm a writer and student and use non-MS programs so I could not get a Chromebook. I also needed a laptop so I had a way to write or research when I was travelling. I have a large desktop ""work"" computer where most of my work is done. I had a similar HP laptop but the keyboard and touch pad went out and I expect that those two things are the weakest link in any laptop. Buy a silicon key cover to make the life of your keyboard last, but these laptops, on average last abut 2-3 years. Another thing that will make the computer last longer is to get a USB mouse to avoid using the track pad.About the only difference between the new and the old HPs was that this had 4G of RAM and the other had 8G of RAM. This Stream is definitely good at not seizing or lurching when you watch a movie or video. The other additive that Microsoft has put on this computer is the ""Windows 10-S."" It is easy to get out of, and there is a toggle to change the program to ""Windows 11 Home,"" which is more capable of evading corporate MS's iron handed ownership of my computer. The instructions are online and they send a large postcard with the computer which also has instructions. It is just a  matter of going into ""settings"" and changing it.I do not mind the PC and MS ""marriage"" but I do not want a computer that tells me I can only use their programs which happened with Chromebook. This one is constantly asking (begging) me to turn on my Cloud service, and turn on other MS Programs. I do not do any of that, and I do not want to send my work to the cloud (When I import it into the big machine I will). I like that it has an extra USB port. Otherwise it is pretty basic and reminds me of  Chromebook, (which I like but cannot use because of the non-MS proprietary writing programs I use).As far as using it for entertainment or videos, the sound is nice and loud (but not blasting) the picture is great, and it does not buffer endlessly-- but that may be my internet service.My overall opinion is ""nice.""  It is a good computer for Students or Writers who do not want or need to spend $1000 on top of the line equipment.

644,DRZ,2022,5,The HP Envy 6055e is a Winner!,I love the quality and features of the Envy 6055e. HP Laptop computer's have always been my choice. They last and last. Because I'm not a gamer nor run a home business I don't need a lighting speed or mega space (frankly the average person doesn't either). So I've had my HP laptops for literally 5-8 years before I'm forced to replace them solely due to OUTSIDE programs like windows requiring more and more space.. All I can say about windows is UGH! Constantly battle to clean off 'garbage' apps and their effort to control the world. HP has monitors that are very clear and easy on the eye strain. I don't use cheaters with HP monitors. Those provided by corporations affect your vision. After hours on these my eyes have trouble focusing on TV screen. As time goes on cheaters become necessary to clearly read normal print or images. (Sometimes I replace the 'free' work monitors with my own HP. It's worth saving my vision. Proof of this - I'm over 70 and have great vision - only use +1.00 cheaters for reading menu's in dark restaurants or the tabs they print out when their ink should have been replaced some time ago.,"2020 HP 15 15.6"" HD Touchscreen Premium Laptop - 10th Gen Intel Core i5-1035G1, 16GB DDR4, 512GB SSD, USB Type-C, HDMI, Windows 10 - Silver W",799.00,hp

648,Charles R,2019,5,Nice,"I usually don't write reviews but I think this one is warranted.  This has to be the best ""bang for the buck"" machine that I have ever purchased.  The 10th gen 1035G1 i5 is obscenely fast when mixed with the 16gb ddr4 and the 1/2 TB NVMe sdd.  This is elegant as anything as well.  A beautiful chassis.  I was surprised by how light it is.  I guess that is to be expected since I think everything except for the cpu fan is solid state.  The onboard camera is very clear and a driver license text is legible for secure websites.  The CPU includes neural net instructions from the Xeon line for the first time for consumer in the 10th gen chips.  If you are doing data science with development suites like Anaconda using Jupyter notebooks or working with Netbeans or using a MySQL instance for learning this is blazing fast for a great price.In a nutshell, this offers Windows workstation performance with Chromebook simplicity/pricing.*update* (2/2/21)Well I bought this on Dec 16th 19', so I figured an update was in order.  Power on hours read as 2970 according to HWinfo64 and it is still running strong and I have certainly  put it through its paces  Some might say that the UHD G1 graphics are a bit anemic but I think that it's fine for the 1366x768p screen.  Triple A games most likely will be very slow but classic titles like Portal 2 can be played ""maxed out""The Intel 660p QLC drive is also really good i think for the price.

I know it is not the fastest solution out there but on my Asus AC1300 router I get 325mbps from a different floor of the house the hypotenuse length being about 20-25 through a floor and a wall.  I can game on Google Stadia and download a series of torrents and keep my Comcast 100mbps service relatively transmitting a lot of data for hours with no drop-offs on the Wi-Fi.  Now granted I am stationary, I'm not jumping from tabletop to tabletop confusing the beam-forming of the router.So, it a solid performer that can handle some pretty heavy stuff thrown at it.*end of update*","2020 HP 15 15.6"" HD Touchscreen Premium Laptop - 10th Gen Intel Core i5-1035G1, 16GB DDR4, 512GB SSD, USB Type-C, HDMI, Windows 10 - Silver W",799.00,hp
649,Pineforest,2022,4,good design hyperactive mouse,"I like the silver color and the design of the laptop, including the thin edges of the screen and the power button inside.  I had two Lenovo laptops, which had the power button on the right side or left side of the laptop.  Every time I needed to move the laptop from one place to another, I accidentally turned it off.  The other bad thing about the Lenovo computers is the bad design of the screen hinges.  The screen of both laptops cracked around 18 months after I purchased them.  HP makes definitely a better hardware design and I have never had problems with my HP laptops or desktops.","2020 HP 15 15.6"" HD Touchscreen Premium Laptop - 10th Gen Intel Core i5-1035G1, 16GB DDR4, 512GB SSD, USB Type-C, HDMI, Windows 10 - Silver W",799.00,hp
650,Danny Nguyen,2020,5,"2020 HP 15 15.6"" HD Touchscreen Premium Laptop","Key Points:- A cheap deal for a competitive performance laptop- Thin & Lightweight (Easy to carry)- Large storage space for basically any consumer need- Comes with HP Customer Service application on set-up (1-year warranty)Experience:If you're like me, you hate to buy something without the full confidence in the product first. Believe me, it's difficult sometimes to buy things online due to the limitation of only being able to rely on other customer's reviews before the product is purchased and arrives at your doorstep. However, I have a pretty positive outlook on this laptop for its price. I attached a few photos to showcase its exterior mechanisms, as well as showcase a general size of what laptop to expect in real-world size (as opposed to reading numbers and expecting to visualize that in your head). The laptop is about 23cm length by 35-36cm width with a thickness of 1.5 cm. The weight is as advertised, it's comfortable to carry around and will fit in thin spaces; it won't occupy too much room in a backpack or luggage. For its technical aspects, I used a free CPU test online called UserBenchmark to compare its performance to other users who also documented their computers/laptops. (This provides a bias as it only takes into account for users who test their computers on that specific software, but it's still a good comparison to get a general idea of the performance the laptop provides.) Attached also is the report containing simplified and relevant data to its specifications. Its computing power is where this computer shines the most, as it performs in the top 75%+ percentile, which is what most consumers will desire, as GPU is of less importance in that they don't intend to purchase a cheaper laptop with the intentions to play heavier & more demanding video games on it. I was actually pleasantly surprised to hear of a lower pricing laptop that came with 16GB of RAM, which is almost unheard of for this price range, and although I didn't document how much free space was available upon receiving and setting it up, there is still ~400+ GB available after transferring the bulk of my applications and user data from my old laptop. For the price it's set at, I personally think it's a great deal since its competitors will often price the same specifications for almost twice the price. As a side note, HP doesn't load the computer with so many useless applications as Lenovo does that the consumer will more than likely never use... (occupying memory). Overall, very happy & satisfied with my purchase, I would thoroughly recommend it, and I look forward to programming code with this laptop.","2020 HP 15 15.6"" HD Touchscreen Premium Laptop - 10th Gen Intel Core i5-1035G1, 16GB DDR4, 512GB SSD, USB Type-C, HDMI, Windows 10 - Silver W",799.00,hp
651,A guy,2020,4,"Great laptop, good value","Background: I bought this six months ago, weeks before the pandemic. I have been using it 10-12h every day, mainly for work (PhD in biochemistry). I installed Kubuntu on the first day and seldom boot on Windows. Main software I use is Firefox, PyCharmm, Zoom, and office stuff. I do not play games.Overall, it is a great computer. The CPU is quite fast, the NVME SSD is excellent, and 16 Gb is more than enough RAM for my needs. The i5-1035G1 has 4 core/8 threads, and my experience with it is great. I don't recall a single slow down, and some times I even run small 5-10 min jobs. I cannot comment on the GPU, as I don't play games.The usable screen to overall size rate is good, as there is only a small strip of plastic around it, so the laptop it is not that large, as some 15.6"" models. It feels light and thin. But the screen is a bit dim, and not HD. The keyboard is responsive and there is a numpad, which some may seem as useless, but is a pro by me. The touch pad is ok, but I sometimes wish it to be larger.What I dislike most about the laptop is the thermal design. The cooler is noisy and it runs too often. It's annoying. For some reason, the hot air is blown towards the screen, and I think it makes the noise even more obvious. For some reason, I think the fan was even louder on Windows, so be aware! There are some other annoyances (see below).All in all, it's an excellent laptop for the price tag, if you are not playing games or do not need a good GPU for any reason.Pros: - CPU/RAM/SSD combo, ie, great speed - Touchscreen - Good keyboard - Battery lasts for 3h-4h - Light and thinCons - Noisy fan - Screen is a bit dim, and it is not HD (res is 1366x768) - Keyboard is not backlit","2020 HP 15 15.6"" HD Touchscreen Premium Laptop - 10th Gen Intel Core i5-1035G1, 16GB DDR4, 512GB SSD, USB Type-C, HDMI, Windows 10 - Silver W",799.00,hp

653,Gurmaan singh,2020,4,ALMOST QUITE GOOD LAPTOP IN THIS PRICE RANGE,"I will try to cover all important information that is necessary before buying this laptop, mainly i will focus on hardware and performance .To start with , I bought this laptop for my study purposes and with 16gb of RAM it works great, However if you are seeking for games as well , i would not recommend this laptop due to low screen quality and Graphic card.MANUFACTURING - The laptop is made of plastic , quality is good but Could not compete metal body. Moreover , I love the design of screen , almost minimum bezel and it gives a premium look. Keyboard keys are smooth.I sometimes face a little issues with touchpad sometimes it stuck or hangs maybe i can call it less sensitive that isn't a big issue to worry also the touchscreen works really fine , no worries at all. There are no lights under keyboard pads,so it makes it difficult to type in dark.PERFORMANCE- This laptop starts pretty fast in almost under 20 secs, it will boot up and take you to desktop. I played Asphalt 9 on this laptop on the very first day and it played smoothly  , and you can play other games also but problem will be that it will be in low quality due to less resolution of screen otherwise processor has no problem in running games (for more information you can search for processor details on google according to your priorities).I would not recommend for gaming purposes.THINGS TO NOTE- Since this product is available from third party you won’t be getting 12 months warranty cause they upgrade the laptop and then deliver further, in my case i got 9 months of warranty.Laptop is quite slim and gives a quite unique look. No problem with wifi and battery (4-5hrs on screen battery backup). This was all i knew , To sum up product requires smooth handling due to plastic build , system never hanged for me although i tried to overload it .So if you are looking for light usage and minimal gaming its great also touchscreen is a great feature. .I have attached few screenshots of the device full name and general specs","2020 HP 15 15.6"" HD Touchscreen Premium Laptop - 10th Gen Intel Core i5-1035G1, 16GB DDR4, 512GB SSD, USB Type-C, HDMI, Windows 10 - Silver W",799.00,hp

It starts almost immediately, in seconds.  It's not overloaded with useless apps, so not much to remove.  There is McAfee antivirus but it's not activated.  So in 1 month I'm not going to get annoying pop - ups asking me to pay for it.It's the first time I've had touch screen.  I didn't think I needed it, and probably wouldn't except that I am not teaching a graphic design class and the touch screen is very helpful.  Instead of using the mouse pad to draw I can use the screen, which is more accurate.  I wish the screen laid flat for tablet mode so that I could draw more easily.  but, hey, I didn't know I needed it and HP would most likely charge more for that.Only one complaint.  The construction wasn't well thought out.  The keyboard sits in a tray so there is a bezel around it.  It is constantly scratching at my wrists as I type.  Look carefully at the picture you can see that the silver underneath wraps up around the black keyboardUPDATE: 2 months into owning this computer and I'm still impressed by the speed.  Still hating the construction of the computer.  It's cheaply built but I'm ok with that because the inside is awesome.  I also found that the mic seems to be directional.  Doing a lot of virtual now and I find if I'm not directly in front of the computer, people say they can't hear me.  I think it needs an external mic.  The screen quality can be better.  The image isn't fantastic, but good enough for my liking.

Granted I just bought it a week ago so I might always come back and update this if disappointed- but so far so good. You are basically getting a mid level laptop with some premium features at a bargain bin price.Pros-Battery life is good to borderline impressive. For typical typing and internet surfing your getting a good 6+ hours.The touch screen is very good and excellent for scrolling documents or zooming pictures in an intuitive way.The processor / RAM / SSD combo make it very fast.The screen is bright and has a ""glassy"" feel to it.The keyboard is very ""clicky"" and comfortable. The laptop physically feels very ""solid"" and not cheap and plasticy.Cons-I will caveat the cons with theyre all to be expected based on the item description- and when you consider the price (I paid $525) its well within expectations.The resolution is not ""real"" HD- its 1366x768.The fan can be a bit loud at times, not obnoxious ""ten year old Pentium laptop"" old- but a bit louder than you'd expect for something this modern.The integrated graphics is pretty meh. I got a few older but still modern games like Fallout 4 and Deus Ex to play okay but this definitely isn't a gaming laptop.Bottom line is- if you are looking for something really good for school or business, and don't really play games- this is awesome.

Overall I doubt this PC will last me more that two years.Pros:  budget friendly, responsive computing, USB C, headphone jack and HDMICons:  poor screen, cheap feel, flimsy plastic causes touch pad issues, wifi drops when in sleep mode forces reboot,I came from a MacBook Pro so this was a huge step down in quality and that is really my main complaint.  I switched to PC because I had already made the switch from Apple iPhones to Android and needed something that would work better with my pixel and LG phones which this has done.  I guess it is ok as a mid-low range PC but I cannot get past the feeling that I will be replacing this laptop every two years as I did in the past when I was a PC only kind of guy.  I don't get why Apple can make laptops that feel better and last much longer than any PC I have ever owned ( I was a PC guy from DOS all the way until Windows 8 … when 8 came out there was no way I could stay a windows guy...

665,David V,2020,4,This laptop is a BANSHEE!,"This laptop is fundamentally fine, powerful and lightweight.  It has these drawbacks that prevent me from giving it 5 stars:* It is VERY VERY LOUD.  The fan turned on immediately, stays on almost constantly, and it is not subtle.* The touchpad buttons are not visually demarcated from the touchpad itself, you just press down the bottom corners of the touchpad to effect a mouse click.  However, since those areas are also active touchpad areas, it may be hard to click precisely where you want.  In addition it feels a bit cheap.* The laptop is no wider than the keyboard itself, and the keyboard has a full number pad.  This means that your hands, if you touch-type, are offset to the left of the laptop rather than centered in front of the screen, which is minor but slightly annoying.","2020 HP 15 15.6"" HD Touchscreen Premium Laptop - 10th Gen Intel Core i5-1035G1, 16GB DDR4, 512GB SSD, USB Type-C, HDMI, Windows 10 - Silver W",799.00,hp

Why Amazon must I pay ANYTHING to return this inferior product.  Because the Seller sold it to me in the condition I received it, they should pay Amazon IN FULL to have it returned and restocked or whatever will be done with it.If the Seller #Superdealstore does not reply and give me satisfying assistance, then I will have to cover whatever costs are needed to return the laptop to Amazon, USA.My preference was to privately receive excellent customer service from the Seller and receive a working undamaged laptop replacement, however, since I am under a time constraint, I am left with no option but to make a public complaint in hopes of getting speedy assistance from #Superdealstore.When or IF #Superdealstore properly assists me with this problem, I am more than willing to update this review favorably.","2020 HP 15 15.6"" HD Touchscreen Premium Laptop - 10th Gen Intel Core i5-1035G1, 16GB DDR4, 512GB SSD, USB Type-C, HDMI, Windows 10 - Silver W",799.00,hp

What I found:- Laptop looks great and screen is beautiful.- This model is bare bones and didn’t include a lot of extras- Touch-screen functionality is hit and miss. Sometimes it takes several touches to get the the system to recognize the touches- WiFi connectivity was spotty. Kept losing my signal, without moving the computer. Keep in mind, my router is less than a year old, I pay for cable broad band service and none of the other devices (approximately 15- 20) don’t have any connectivity issues, even the 10 year old laptop.- I decided to return this model and am going to get one that’s a bit more expensive and a model I know a bit better.","2020 HP 15 15.6"" HD Touchscreen Premium Laptop - 10th Gen Intel Core i5-1035G1, 16GB DDR4, 512GB SSD, USB Type-C, HDMI, Windows 10 - Silver W",799.00,hp

The device has masterfully handled every task I've assigned to it. The touch screen is, for lack of a better phrase, a nice touch. Before I received this computer, I used my phone as a computer more often than I did my actual computer. Now that I have this device, I can't wait to put my phone down!

681,John Retire,2020,5,A great laptop so far,"After 5 months of using this computer to work from home, I'm officially disappointed with it. Reasons:-The specs say it has a CPU in the 3.5 range, but mine actually runs between 1.3 and 1.6.-Screen resolution. I didn't notice how low it was before I purchased. I can make due and the picture quality is fine, but over time, it gets annoying to be able to see such a small amount of content on the screen. Web pages often don't display properly.-It doesn't work for Zoom meetings. I have 100 Mbps speed, but get notifications when on Zoom meetings that my connection is unstable. I never get these notifications when zooming on the same network from my iPad or iPhone.-I just don't have any use for a touch screen laptop. All it does is make it a lot easier for my cat to derail my work activity. The touch screen works very well, if that's something you're wanting.-There are much cheaper Acer computers that seem to run much closer to the advertised CPU, have 1920x1080 resolution, and a backlit keyboard.Save yourself some money and frustration and buy an Acer.

Hardly noticeable, although overall it looked brand new. I have no real complaints as of yet while using it. It's what I expected, I knew it is not a computer meant for gaming but more for getting some work done. I can easily open 12 tabs, have a youtube vid running and open a word document but it is not going to run Minecraft on the lowest settings, I mean it can but its unplayable in my opinion.The computer does not come with windows 11 installed, I felt lied too when I got it and saw it running windows 10 In S mode out of the box since the description, title and specs clearly say and show windows 11. (running ""S mode"" just means running safe mode) It comes with a card in the box telling you how to disable it, but one disabled it can not be re-enabled. The photos even show windows 11. But not to worry, I simply installed windows 11 on my own after a days worth of updates. A quick google search and one youtube vid can help install it.It does not have an ethernet port. But I got an ethernet to USB adaptor to make pages load faster.The camera? It has one! It works, it will get the job done.No issues with any ports or the charging cable, no issues with the mouse pad. Everything feels brand new.In conclusion, this is a decent laptop at its price for getting work done. So if you need a computer to write an essay for school or need to hop in a zoom call then this can work just as good as your phone. Personally I plan to learn and practice learning some programming languages on it from youtube and such. You even have that ""Guarantee by Amazon"" where you can return it in 90 days or get support.","Newest HP 14"" HD Laptop, Windows 11, Intel Celeron Dual-Core Processor Up to 2.60GHz, 4GB RAM, 64GB SSD, Webcam, Dale Pink(Renewed) (Dale Blue)",210.99,hp

779,Virginia Mike,2022,1,Do not expect to be logging in using the forward facing camera,"This is a nice little ""utility computer"", seems to have everything I need (no touch screen, but knew that ahead of time).  BUT....  HP decided to get REAL cheap in an underhanded way.  The forward facing camera, while it appears to work just fine, it is NOT an ""IR"" camera and therefore, Windows can NOT log you in using the camera.  So for the next 2-3 years, every time I want to boot this laptop and use it, I'll be typing in passwords and/or PIN's.  Absolutely NO WHERE is this mentioned in all of HP's literature.  Seems a bit twisted to come pre-installed with Windows-11, but then due to a cheap, made in china camera, Windows ""Hello Face"" feature is completely unsupported.  Would NOT buy this product again.  Ever.  This is my 3rd HP laptop and I am shocked that they did this...  A usable cam would not have cost them $5 more.  And then to not be up front about this and kind of ""hide"" this huge shortcoming is disappointing to say the least.  Would Not recommend if this is a feature you plan on using.  Makes me wonder where else in their selection of hardware that they got equally CHEAP with to save a few pennies.","HP 17-inch Laptop, 11th Generation Intel Core i5-1135G7, Intel Iris Xe Graphics, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, Windows 11 Home (17-cn0025nr,Natural Silver)",495.00,hp

HP used the HP Support Assistant app on the laptop to diagnose and temp-fix the issue, once I was on wifi,  they remotely updated all drivers associated with the wifi issue, and the laptop in general, for a permanent wifi fix, this, all via the wifi connection; and, they are waiting for my update to ensure that the issue is resolved permanently, so for now, I am impressed with the HP laptop and the HP support. I just wish I didnt have a need for the support in the first place. Also, after watching what the tech did remotely, a knowledgeable  person who is AWARE of the HP Support Assistant app could troubleshoot and fix the wifi issue themselves as long as they then also go to the HP site and update the laptop wifi and any other recommended out of date drivers; But again, we shouldnt have to do that... last note, I also have a 3 year old HP Envy laptop that I can now hand off to a family member, it has been bulletproof since day one. I hope to do and say the same about this one in 3 years, minus this incident.","HP 15.6-inch Laptop, 11th Generation Intel Core i5-1135G7, Intel Iris Xe Graphics, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, Windows 11 Home (15-dy2024nr, Natural silver)",519.00,hp

827,Amazon Customer,2022,5,Good laptop but issues with WiFi connectivity,"LOL to the one-star reviews from people who can't connect to Wi-Fi or used to some other brand and can't figure out HP.  It's a computer!  You have to either know how to use it, learn how to use it, or buy support.  I've had this computer for 5 months and yes, yesterday I couldn't connect to Wi-Fi.  Blamed it on this laptop and wondered if I had purchased a warranty.  (I didn't.)  Started reading the reviews.  But then I tried figuring out why my Wi-Fi isn't connecting (via my cell phone).  It took a while, I learned a lot of computer innards, and after successfully connecting to Wi-Fi, I'm typing this review from it.  Wi-Fi problem had nothing to do with laptop.  The laptop actually helped me fix it via diagnostics program. This laptop is great!  Superfast! Pages load instantly - something I wasn't used to with my previous laptops.  Plenty of space for all my ""stuff"" in the form of photos, videos, family trees, and also my husband's business programs, logs, documents and files.

835,Karsten T. Brown,2022,5,Excellent For The Price,"When judging this laptop, always keep the price in mind.First, the cons:Is it a gaming computer? No; the graphics adapter isn't intended for that purpose. Is the housing suitable for those (e.g., children) who toss around electronics without regard for their durability? No; it is cheap plastic. Don't buy it if you expect to use it for those purposes. The matte screen isn't the brightest. The sound quality isn't immersive. There is no optical drive.Now, the pros:The price. This is a 15"" laptop with Windows 11. Even though the laptop isn't for gaming, I have used Adobe cs6 software with no issues— Premiere Pro, Photoshop, Audition. Rendering video isn't super speedy, but it isn't unreasonable. I was extremely doubtful it could run those programs, and didn't buy it for that purpose, as I have another computer for it, but it was definitely a great and welcome surprise.Who should buy this laptop? Anyone who wants a light-weight computer for school, travel, or home, on which they can use email, stream video, take notes, browse the internet, or even edit photos and short videos in Photoshop and Premiere Pro.[As a sidenote, I suspect this laptop would have no issues with the beautiful and ubiquitous memory hog, Google Chrome, but I have not installed it. If you do a lot of browsing— and who doesn't?— then I would suggest looking at other browsers, such as Vivaldi. I offer that advise no matter which computer you might be using, so it is not specific to this laptop.]","HP 15.6-inch Laptop, 11th Generation Intel Core i5-1135G7, Intel Iris Xe Graphics, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, Windows 11 Home (15-dy2024nr, Natural silver)",519.00,hp

I knew I wasn't going to like the track pad for the mouse, so dropped $20 on trackball, nbd.  What I didn't expect was that one month after purchase machine would completely lose the wifi card. Like gone. One day woke up, no wifi, no driver, no hardware, NO ICON. Nothing. Can't find it.  OS troubleshoot says connect ethernet cable. THERE IS NO ETHERNET PORT ON MACHINE. Didn't think I'd need one, features went on and on about how blazing fast the wifi was.  What wifi? No wifi here. Randomly had a cheap usb wifi dongle in a drawer, amazing luck. Connect to internet. Run windows update, wifi back! Hooray! Two days later, where's the wifi? What wifi? No wifi here. Doesn't look like there ever was. Back to the dongle. Run windows update, nothing. Uh oh. Update drivers, nothing. Update BIOS, nothing. Uninstall / reinstall drivers, nothing. HP diagnostic program is a joke. Won't run unless I'm connected to the internet. What? How's that supposed to help troubleshoot connection issues? Device manager has no hardware/drivers. Not even hidden ones. Hours of research on the internet. Tried a bunch of command prompt stuff people said worked for them. Nothing. Countless restarts. Long story short error 45 accross the board, no hardware detected.  I'm giving up. 1 month into my 2 year protection program, but not worth time or energy to send back. Dropped $35 on a better wifi dongle, gonna roll with that for time being.

846,Chubb,2022,1,The laptop arrived with a crack case,"We bought this computer to replace one that was ""irredeemable"". It has an i5 Intel processor which appears to be ten times faster than the i3.  I am not sure why the speed has increased, but we like it a whole lot better.  The only way we could make the old one useable was to leave it on 24 hours a day.  This computer closes down when we shut the lid and starts up when we lift it.  The only reason we bought this computer was to have a computer that is only used for financial matters----we do not search the web or receive e-mails.  The main reason we bought this laptop from Amazon was the 4 year extended warranty, which, I was told, included tech support.  We had a lot of problems with the last laptop, and needed tech support which was only good for one year.  (By the way, it is interesting that we enjoyed the last computer until one day Microsoft ""updated"" my windows 10 and then the computer stopped working.  I contacted Microsoft and told them how the computer worked fine until they ""updated"" my computer, and asked if they would fix it.  They said they would be glad to fix it for a $99 charge.  At that point I was loud and angry.  I explained that I felt that this was ransom ware.  ""You screwed up my computer and for $99 you will fix it"".  I said I would not pay such ransom ware money.  I would throw my computer away first and buy a new one.  I contacted Acer tech support and they said they would fix it for nothing.  They did, and when asked how I could keep this from happening again they said just unclick the ""automatic update button"".  I did just that and for 4 years I loved my computer again.)  An update to my review:  the laptop arrived with a crack on the face just to the left of the top left speaker.  I returned the computer to the supplier and they gave me credit for it minus $77.70 for a restocking charge.  No doubt they are restocking the computer so they can sell it to you and pull the same scam on you.-----------A further update on my refund----------The seller (Tech Deals Store) is refusing to refund all my money since I opened the box and started using it before I discovered the crack.  I have asked for a full refund, and am awaiting their answer.  If I don't receive my money then I will contact Amazon and ask them for the remainder off my refund.  If that doesn't work then I will file a dispute with my credit card company.  ( I am not letting Tech Deals Store get by with this scam.)  Further update---- Amazon gave me the $77.70 back.  I hope I remember the name ""Tech Deals Store"" and never buy from these people again.","HP 15.6-inch Laptop, 11th Generation Intel Core i5-1135G7, Intel Iris Xe Graphics, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, Windows 11 Home (15-dy2024nr, Natural silver)",519.00,hp

Recently I left my job and took some time off to find a new one and my old laptop died right before I was scheduled to have 5 interviews.  I went to Best Buy and talked with a sales guy and told him my budget and what I needed a laptop for (interviews, using Microsoft office suite, using my cricut) and he found this computer for me. It arrived in 1 day and was easy to set up. I love that there is an independent keypad for numbers. I got through multiple zoom meetings with no glitching. The battery life is great, it’s light weight, and is pretty fast when loading programs. I have zero complaints. There was a prompt about touch screen but I honestly didn’t know it came with one (if it does) so I’ll try that and edit my review.

869,Amazon Customer,2022,4,Excellent budget PC,"My work laptop is a Microsoft Surface Pro. Now, I like the ""idea"" if a Surface Pro but when it comes to doing actual work, it's useless (reading email, Office365, etc.). So I began looking for a good budget laptop that I can use for work and other personal things while I travel (don't get any ideas, I mean travel and stay with my folks for an extended period of time). This laptop works quite nicely.Everything works above average. I'm not sure about heavy editing with video, music, and like Photoshop, but for the basic purposes of getting work done reading email, using Office 365, and so on it works great. My desktop handles the heavy stuff (yes, actually I hate laptops).I like the size (15"") - easy to carry around. Was a little hesitant about Windows 11 but it turns out pretty similar to 10 (hey - it took me a few years to evolve from DOS to Windows...). It's not touch screen, but that's okay b/c I'm not used to touch screen. It has a separate number pad - bit plus to me entering a lot of numbers. Enough USB ports, etc. and even a USB-C. I like it. It has an SSD which is GREAT. I replaced my desktop HDD with SDD and the time to boot went from about 4 minutes and 40 seconds to about 40 seconds...bit plus there! If you get a laptop, make double-sure it has SDD. Never mind about storage space b/c everything is in the cloud these days anyway.Happy with the purchase! Why didn't I give it a score of 5?

This HP ""Jacuzzi"" machine is just terrible. The only things I can say for it are that it's lightweight and the battery life seems to be good.I blame myself for not noticing that this machine does not have a touch screen. I just never assumed a chromebook wouldn't have one. The display quality is absolutely awful. You have to have the screen right in front of you, at exactly the right angle, or you can't see anything. Any movement of anyone or anything during a video causes some kind of green splotches to flash on and off all over the screen.I guess I got spoiled with the Samsung, but I learned from this experience not to buy a low-end chromebook. I have returned this already, and after some research (which I should have done in the first place) I went to Lenovo's website and bought a C13 Yoga Thinkpad chromebook, on sale for $349.

I am a Comp Sci student and one of the software I needed for my course was very RAM heavy (Android Studio is anyone is interested). The 8GB of RAM mentioned is true however you will only get to use about 6GB. This is because the hardware reserves 2GB of ram to actually run the laptop (I think?).

1086,Anthony,2019,5,Great Laptop - Highly Responsive and Great Touch Screen,"Overall, I would say the laptop is great. It is definitely worth the price of around $300. It is small, lightweight (although could be more), responsive, looks great, smells new after months, smooth to use, track pad is pretty good,overall good chromebook.I'm not really too much of a Tech person but grew up with computers in my 20's mostly using it for school and personal stuff.I had it for a few months now so my beginning concerns aren't the same as my latter ones. I'll try to go over really quickly the basic beginning concerns I had then go through with my impressions with months of use later on. 1366 X 768 isn't HD but it's acceptable. Processing speed is 2.1 ghz, never had a problem or issue with lags. 4 gb ram is okay, probably wouldnt do 2 gb. 11.6 screen, I wanted something smaller so this is a plus to me. Bit heavy with 2.64 lbs for a small laptop but it's okay, still my lightest one. internet connection is good and bluetooth use was good. Processor never had a problem with Mediatek. Convertible to tablet mode is a plus. Solid state so processes quickly which is a big plus. Battery life is great, I hate charging and finding an outlet, but this goes on for more than 8-10 hours, just doing school stuff, no videos. I would say I searched like crazy in the beginning. I wanted one main personal laptop and one small convertible laptop and this was the best convertible one I could find on Amazon. I compared like 20+ laptops over a week, I was really putting a ridiculous amount of time on it. But I had specific things I wanted in mine, like speed, aesthetics, smooth performance, and valued those more than other things. I wanted things to be really convenient.I have started using chromebooks more because they are inexpensive and very convenient to use. They aren't too good for hardcore processing, but for school work or personal work, it meets all my needs. Whenever I use it, everything is pretty smooth and seamless. Start and shut down are almost instant. I have never had an issue with it's use so far. I think for me, the biggest plus is the elegance. It makes everything very easy to use, it looks great, it even retains its new smell after some months with light use. My other laptops have poor track pads but this one is infinitely better. I don't feel the need to use a wireless mouse as well. I ended up getting a screen protector for it for almost $20 because it was a touch screen. I like how it has a lot of features like hdmi cables, one usbs, even a memory card slot. I think for the price, it is definitely worth it. It feels like a very high end chromebook, although I generally wouldn't pay too much for a laptop in general because I don't need high processing. The buttons feel nice and smooth. There hasn't been much lag or delay time. Updates are easy and smooth. Screen is nice to look at and the colors are great. There doesn't seem to be much glare and it feels aesthetically pleasing. Yeah everything's really nice with this.There are some things I don't like about it though. Originally, I had planned to use this as a tablet part-time because I didn't want to buy paper textbooks. I thought of using all of it on this chromebook, but it turned out to not be convenient because it was too heavy. I would use it on the train and my hands would almost immediately get tired trying to read. I would have to rest is down on myself, which isn't a big deal but wanted something I could read ebooks and pdfs on conveniently. I don't know if I will end up getting another one to serve that purpose. It also is a chromebook so it cannot download files and stuff. I don't particularly like that because that stops it from being my main computer. I don't like putting personal stuff on my drive, like my expenses or whatever even though it is irrational and I do it with some apps. Maybe I should, but the fact that everything is on my drive to see makes me feel a bit uncomfortable. I don't mind that this computer cannot really do much without internet because I always have something saved on it. It has 64 gb of memory which I think is quite significant. I mean, if I couldn't put anything on the drive, I wouldn't feel that, but 64 gb + drive storage seems more than enough and I am trying to be a minimalist anyway. Yeah not that many cons.Anyway, I wanted a inexpensive laptop but this definitely performs up to par with most laptops. Never had a problem with it so far months into my purchase but did want something I could use as a tablet. Would definitely recommend. Definitely better than a lot of the stuff I grew up with that cost 3x more. Best laptop I could find and really pleasantly surprised overall in many areas.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",289,lenovo
1087,Groingo,2022,5,A very  unexpected surprise!,"Renewed Lenovo C330 arrived in a huge box clearly marked HEAVY LOAD....someone had a sense of humor being that the whole thing weighed only 4 pounds and you could have put ten of these in boxes inside their big box!Opening the box the description had said it had cosmetic damage on the sides and gouges on the case, close inspection revealed no damage, it was MINT condition plus the moment I cracked the lid open it was already setting itself up and after a couple of minutes it was ready to go, (try that WINDOWS!) it had syncd itself from my other Chromebook!The main reason I bought the Lenovo Chromebook was to see first hand how it compared to the two Acer Chromebooks I have, the Acer Spin 713 and the Acer R13, both having a lot of aggrivating issues relating to OS integration.Acer both 713 and R13 had serious issues with poor sound loudness and quality, image quality is poor even though they were running over 2000 resolution, poor internet speed as both 713 and R13 kept switching to lower speed settings, while virtual keyboard settings in both Acer's suffered from serious lag, and screen fragmentation, Bluetooth pairing was poor with continual drops and no restart if computer woke from sleep and slower overall performance on and offline if used as a tablet.Lenovo: Suffers from none of the above and excel's in many areas starting with Sound which is LOUD, image quality even with a low 1366 resolution is tight, sharp, and vivid, internet speed stayed where you put it and is quick, virtual keyboard no issues, Bluetooth pairs easily and is ready after sleep with no drops, tablet performance no different, quick and precise.I agree with some other comments that this is a really handsome computer, the eggshell white with dark grey keys is a real eye catcher, that backed up by a great overall experience and I just noticed the price for these as renewed from the Amazon Warehouse has dropped, you will NOT be dissapointed!Now for the real twist:  I have bought 9 different Chromebooks over the past couple of months to see if they had that something special that makes them indespensible and I must honestly say that my Fire Tablets 7 through 10 and ONLY the Fire Tablets are much more useful, easy to use, take a ton less space, have much broader uses, easier to take with, typically much higher video, image and sound quality and much faster on the internet and cost waaaay less but give you so much more, so the grand experiment is done and I will be finding some good homes for the Chromebooks.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",289,lenovo
1088,Josh Hartman,2018,5,Far exceeded my expectations,"Full disclosure, I am not an IT professional but use laptops, tablets, and desktop computers daily in my personal and work life. This chromebook has far exceeded my expectations. This is my first time using a chromebook. I have had a week or so to really dig into the device. I own an alienware gaming laptop, but I find myself only using it now for gaming purposes only.This chromebook is fast in my opinion. The speed is snappy and the device responds quickly to gestures and commands. I have yet to find sometime I can't do on this that I do on my windows laptop aside from gaming. One game I like to play requires windows, mac, or linux. Since this has an ARM processor it does not support linux applications at this time.Design: This device is a bright attractive white chromebook. I find the design to be pleasing to the eye and appears sturdy even though it is made from plastic. I do not particularly like using it in tablet mode. The screen feels bulky and sometimes unmanageable in tablet mode. The screen quickly transitions to whatever position to place it in whether laptop, tent, or tablet mode. I personal find myself not even using my LG tablet for much of anything except when I need LTE internet away from home. Overall the design is great.Screen/Input: I find the keyboard to be on par with most laptop keyboards. The keys are a little shallow and I feel my typing has slowed a little bit, but not by much. The IPS touchscreen is very responsive and rarely find myself having to touch the screen more than once for my intended gesture. Screen is bright in home conditions, but feel it would lack in more intense lighting situations, such as outdoors.Ease of Use: The google play store makes this thing be able to do just about anything. I have not tried any intense applications. I use chrome, netflix, hulu, evernote, several banking apps, and various other apps. All of them are snappy responsive. The bank apps load like they are in phone mode, thus they are in a small window. The apps still work as designed. Netflix and Hulu playback is smooth and pleasant to watch on the screen.Overall, I am impressed with the Google OS and this device in general. If your someone who is on the fence about the operating system, I suggest you give it a try. The battery life is good as well. When using my gaming laptop its always with a cord tethered nearby. I also understand a gaming laptop is far more power intensive. I have yet to use this chromebook while charging it. The battery has allowed me to watch 4-5 hours of netflix, talk on facebook, and text through my phone without ever getting critically low. I charge it at night and then never put it back on till the next night. This is a max screen brightness. I was also very surprised with the speakers. The speakers were much louder and not distorted. I honestly expected them to be cheap netbook quality that is mostly better just to never use them, but thats not the case with this chromebook. I do generally use a bluetooth headset. The bluetooth headset paired with extreme simplicity. I also set up my brother wireless laser printer with google cloud print in less than 30 seconds.Google did it right and lenovo delivered a solid product. I did purchase this on sale for $200 but would have spent the $300. If your a web surfer, music listener, netflix watcher I highly recommend this. If you need windows intense software then go with windows. Otherwise I think you'll find yourself using this as your primary device as I have.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",289,lenovo

1092,John,2022,5,Great Chromebook but with a few nitpicks,"I was curious on what a chromebook had to offer since i never used or owned one and i'm in need of a laptop since i'm living somewhere else.This chromebook is fairly light and small and gets the job done and there little to no wait time when you open the chromebook turning on automatically.There a bunch of things i noticed while using it is you can link your phone with the chromebook in where once you previously log into the chromebook beforehand you can unlock your chromebook right after by unlocking your phone (both have to have bluetooth enable). To search up shortcuts you can easily click the search button on the keyboard and type in shortcut and it have it where you can search all the shortcuts you can do and what nice is any additional keyboard say a bluetooth one can also do some of the shortcuts.Also there are options where you can close the laptop and you have two options you can either put the laptop to sleep or it just turns off the screen then there a option to lock it by closing it or not. nice note is if you have display off you can still listen to pandora,mp3,or youtube.Also for those who are wondering - you can play minecraft, ragnorak mobile (not fully keyboard control it only for texting in chat so no WASD movement) and hearthstone on it so it have it nice touch but you cant use the split screen feature from chrome so that a bummer now for the drawbacks. Also you can use microsoft word, excel and powerpoint from the googleplay store but you would need a account for it or just use the free online version.This is small nit pick - the screen is 720p yet it clear but it is noticeable when you use it long enough wish it was HD or 1080p also some apps are set to the 720p by default. the google play store youtube uses the quality of the screen while chrome youtube (basically youtube normally on browser) is more clear. Also skype doesn't have screenshare or sharesound so that a major bummer and skype seem to run slow on the chromebook in terms having people sharescreen their desktop it always come out blurry on some occasions and i have to minimize and reopen skype to actually see what going on. i haven't try video call yet so it up to debate. Lastly for discord from google playstore you would need to adjust some of the call setting for it to work. the default setting would cut you off mid sentence and random pausing in between.Another thing is you can't adjust the idle timer it either it goes to sleep, display turns off or stays on there no option to change it and when you have option to lock your desktop it end your skype call so you would have to go into settings for normal use, call use, and game use.lastly is your better off having your laptop go into sleep mode with locked instead of turning it off. when you shut it down the screen goes blank white then gets brighter and brighter then goes to black. it's just me being paranoid like it would be better if it just dims and turns off instead of going very bright then poof black not to mention if you usually play on medium to low brightness setting then having your screen go maximum brightness with no setting to change it get annoying not to mention when you open up your chromebook after shutting it off it adjusted your brightness setting as well as well a bright chrome logo before going into login. Mostly this is a nit pick since it bothersome when you are using it in middle of the night then when you turn it off it hit you with the brightest setting so i just end up closing it to sleep mode or shut off and look away.All in all it a pretty good chromebook i just wish it had more options in the settings as well have priority app settings in task manager","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",289,lenovo

1095,THG,2021,4,Incredible value for the price,"I bought this computer while on a trip to replace a different Lenovo computer that died while I was on deadline for an assignment while traveling. Fortunately, I was able to get this next-day Prime delivered to where I was staying in LA and began using it minutes after it arrived. To make this review easy, I'm breaking it down by main key features: display, keyboard, battery life, and build quality.Display: For the price, I don't think you're going to find one much nicer in terms of resolution and quality. Incredibly, you are getting a true IPS panel with nice viewing angles. I've found that the low res matte displays on other cheaper Chromebooks are incredibly difficult use and lead to eye strain. I'm a personal believer in purchasing as much screen real estate and pixel density as possible -- it really does make a huge difference. Another huge plus (and I'm not sure if this across the Chromebook line or specific to this one) is the night mode that cuts out blue light and boosts yellows -- this is another hugely important feature for me, personally. Touch screen functionality works fine. Display cons are that the bezels are massive and with it being super glossy, there can be lots of glare.Keyboard: Basically Lenovo has it figured out with keyboard layouts and feel. While it's nowhere near as nice as the Thinkpad keyboard, this one is laid out quite nicely and is easy to complete bigger writing assignments on. There's no backlight, which would be a huge plus, but for the price, it's difficult to find anything to complain about. The top row function keys will be familiar to those coming from the Mac ecosystem. Everything is very easy. The trackpad is also surprisingly nice for the price as well. Gestures work without issue.Battery life: This is where this computer truly shines. I purchased this while I was traveling during the winter and needed to it to complete weekly freelance assignments and had plenty of battery life while on the road. Even when being back home laying in bed watching Youtube or Netflix, the battery lasts all night, and then some. I basically never take the charger with me because I don't feel that it's necessary (unless it's already low on juice). In terms of just general surfing and Google doc stuff, you should be able to get a couple of days out of the battery. If you're watching videos and streaming, it's still a good full day's worth of battery life.Build quality: I've previously had an HP Chromebook and was not impressed by the build quality by any means. It felt cheap, almost like a toy. While this Lenovo Chromebook feels much more solid, I still wouldn't compare it to a Thinkpad or the higher end machines in Lenovo's lineup. Still, it feels quite durable and I've never worried about carrying it in a pack all day, or stacking books and other heavy items on top of it. The only thing that is kind of a bother is that the brilliant white finish does get smudges and dirty fingerprints on it. But that's more of a nuisance, not a flaw with the machine.For the price, you really can't do much better. So long as you have reasonable expectations for what you're getting and how much you're paying, you will be very pleased by this product.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",289,lenovo

1099,James M.,2019,5,First Chromebook.  Very Impressed.,"Regarding Chrome OS.  This is my first chromebook so I'm still learning, but so far I'm extremely impressed!  It seems like the chromebook was the computer I've always needed but never realized I wanted!  Marrying the pc experience to an android compatible operating system is magical.  Although I'm apprehensive about this browser-based computing, I've found it very easy to save and edit documents offline so I'm still able to work on the go.  I can also connect it to my android phone, send and receive text messages with it, emulate old school video games (GBC, NES, SNES, GBA, and NDS), connect it to my bluetooth speakers and blast some jams.  I regret not making Chrome OS a part of my life MUCH sooner!Regarding performance.  I've heard people say this processor is mediocre.  I have to ask, what are those people even doing to arrive at the conclusion?!  I have not once seen the slightest indication that this thing isn't *completely* competent for daily needs.  Incredible response time.  No lag when scrolling.  Minimal to no delay opening apps.  Stunningly fast start up time.  I feel like it's a pretty outstanding performer, overall.  Sure, it's no high end gaming machine, but who buys a Chromebook looking for advanced gaming capabilities?  The bottom line: you click; the computer responds instantly.  Really, what more could you ask for?Regarding the build quality.  It's a bit bulky in its ""tablet"" mode and lacks the premium build materials of high end chromebooks, but it still looks and feels great - certainly better than any laptop PC I've ever owned!  The white color is gorgeous.  The size is perfect.  The keyboard is comfortable and the touch pad is large and responsive.  If you look closely you'll see Lenovo coated the touch pad with a hefty clear coat to prevent wear and tear.  As someone who immediately coats touch pads with contact paper to prevent damage, this is an impressive step, however inconspicuous to the average user.  Additionally the hinge feels solid and smooth.  The construction of the entire build just feels extremely sturdy.  The monitor produces extremely sharp images with outstanding color.  Although many people express dissatisfaction with the lack of 1080p and the larger bezels framing the monitor, I didn't even notice!  If you're not planning to do professional photo editing, I doubt you'll notice either.  (Side note: If bezels really concern you, consider the experience of flipping this into tablet mode and walking around with it while working.  Wider bezels in this situation result in fewer accidental screen taps from fingers that are curled around the edges holding it.)I absolutely recommend this chromebook.  It's a steal at this price point, and stands to replace my quad core, 8gb Windows 10 laptop for most of my computing needs.  Sure, it's not a 1080p monitor, lacks a backlit keyboard, and isn't made out of aluminum, but goodness gracious if isn't the coolest, most practical little laptop I've ever owned.It was even featured as one of the best chromebooks money can buy as of Feb 2019 by Android Police and Android Authority!!","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",289,lenovo
1100,WML,2022,5,Love it. Perfect for travel and light use.,Works perfectly for my light usage. Was fantastic for a long trip cross country for watching movies. Holds a charge for a very long time.,"Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",289,lenovo
1101,Nick B,2019,4,Excellent value for the money!,"I'm on the second week now of using the Lenovo C330 convertible Chromebook (there are multiple models on the site under C330 so I'm specifying it is the model with 4GB RAM, 64GB SSD,  MediaTek MT8173C processor). I needed to replace my 9 year old Macbook Pro that was an excellent machine but just couldn't handle modern computing needs. However, I have a desktop for more intense computing needs, so I really didn't want to spend $1000+ on a new MacBook to browse the web, watch YouTube videos, read eBooks, watch Netflix etc in the evening. Cheap laptops in the sub $350 range are frankly almost all junk, so I wasn't really interested in buying one of those either. I don't want a tablet because I want a keyboard and I like to lie flat in bed and that's just not convenient.Enter the Chromebook! So far, this has been an impressive solution for the purchase price of $231. Of course, Chromebooks have a variety of hardware and you need to do your homework to get the best experience. For about $50 more than lesser Chrombooks, this is an ideal middle ground solution. Within its comparable price range, the MediaTek MT8173C processor scores at the top as far as processing speed. Coupled with 4GB DDR3 RAM and a 64 GB SSD for boot speed, plus how lightweight of an OS ChromeOS is, this is a very well performing little machine for the price. Web browsing is snappy, YouTube loads very quickly and the Google Play store gives you access to all the apps you need. So far, all apps have loaded without any issues and function well. The battery life is remarkable - I've gotten 13-14 hours of use from it and still had 15% when I finally plugged it in. ChromeOS is super easy to learn/user friendly and reminds me of the user experience of a phone/tablet.NOW - this machine is not a few things. It doesn't have a super high resolution screen, but it's a small screen, so it's not bad, but if you're used to a Retina screen it will be a bit lower in quality. It is fine and perfectly functional, but not exceptional, as a tablet (not the best touch screen response and obviously heavier than normal tablets and ChromeOS isn't as optimized for touch screen use compared to phone/tablet operating systems - think things like bigger front/back/X buttons - those aren't as prevalent on ChromeOS). The keypad is nice and sensitive but the click is loud. Printing is probably a pain but I have a desktop for that, so I don't care. So far, those are really the only cons I have found to this machine, but the pros far outweigh and you need to be realistic about features vs. price. It does a lot of things really well at the current list price of $251. It is not a $1000 laptop and you simply can't expect $1000 features from it.I'm very glad I spent the extra money for this over the sub-$200 Chromebooks with lower quality hardware and no convertible/touch screens. The convertible/touch really makes it fun to use.So, in summary: If you just need a machine to do run of the mill browsing, streaming, etc I think this is an almost perfect solution and an excellent value for the money.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",289,lenovo
1102,Tim ,2022,5,Screen quality is superb!,I gave a neutral grade on gaming since I don't use the Chromebook for that.,"Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",289,lenovo
1103,tani,2021,4,Works great... after updating.,"Right out of the box, we got it set up and started checking on different apps. Every issue we had with the little Chromebook was resolved after we updated it, except for an issue with forever being stuck on the loading screen for Audible.The issues we had right out of the box, which were fixed on update, were: Netflix was low quality (but every other streaming app worked fine), Audible would not load (didnt fix on update), couldn't scroll down on pages anywhere especially bad in Settings, and we had to minimize the Settings app every time we selected something otherwise it would pretend it was stuck. Now that its working after update, I have NO ISSUES that would cause me to be upset with the device. No Audible is fine, I use my phone for that 99% of the time, we just wanted to have it on the Chromebook because it was an available app, so no big deal on our end.  I will say that I don't use the volume speakers on the Chromebook (I use bluetooth headphones and speaker) but it is about as good as a cheap device is expected to have (it wont rock your world musically, no real bass), some people might have an issue with this.  I also do not use it to play any sort of game, so I don't have any feedback on using it that way.Altogether, I would buy this again in a heartbeat! Great product that handles me having many applications and Chrome tabs open at once.Update: After a few days of hard use, the machine is running excellently. Its able to work efficiently with multiple tabs and apps running at the same time, including video and audio streaming. My only complaints are that the screen wobbles slightly if used as a touchscreen in a laptop-position, folding it back into a laptop-position from a V or tablet-position feels concerning as the hinge is sort of tight and it makes you feel like you might break it if you go too fast or carelessly, and when using the keyboard the edge of the chromebook can bite into my wrists if I rest them on it but that's easily resolved by not placing the chromebook in a position higher than my hands sit. Still a great machine and would buy again!","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",289,lenovo
1104,Kaleb,2019,5,Incredible Chromebook,"This is my first Chromebook. I decided to get one because most of what I use a computer for doesn't require anything more heavy duty than what this has to offer. I'll still use my other computer should I require things like Photoshop or those heavier use programs, but since I got my Chromebook a week ago, I haven't even touched my other laptop.The Pros:Battery life - When it estimates that I have 12-13 hours of battery life, it means it. I can stream videos and multitask and it doesn't sacrifice that time. Time to charge is also impressively quick.Speed - I open the lid and it's on. It's that simple. No waiting for everything to load up. I had to do an update and it took maybe 10 seconds, including restart time. I know internet will vary depending on network, but I'm able to easily multitask and it's not dragging. I'm currently casting a video to my TV and have multiple tabs open on chrome, all with no lag to the video (which would often happen with my other laptop).Ease of use - If you're already a chrome/google user, switching over to a chromebook is a piece of cake. I didn't have to transfer anything, and I do have to eventually back a few more things up to my Drive, but again, that's easy. Getting used to more app-based programs than desktop ones is easy enough too.  Almost everything that would have required a windows download has an app version or a way to use it on a chromebook as well.Screen/Tablet mode - I haven't toyed too much with the touch screen, but it's a nice perk. I like being able to flip the screen around and turn it to the side and bam, it's a big tablet. So far I've only used it like this once to read some comics, but it was nice. Brightness is great too. I usually have it down halfway or less even.Size - I was worried about it being too small because my other laptop is somewhere between 13-14'' but it's a really great size. This thing is incredibly light too. Much lighter than I'd expected. Love it.The Cons, though extremely minor:Caps Lock - Mostly, it's a ""getting used to"" factor that I just haven't quite mastered yet. There's no caps lock key, and the search button that replaces it isn't terrible, but I think I'd have preferred to just have the caps key. (You can just press alt+search for caps lock easily enough though)Backlighting - my other computer had backlit keys. Totally an ""extra"" that's not necessary, but regardless.And that's it. If you're looking for something light and simple for everyday use, this is an incredible choice.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",289,lenovo
1105,W. Walsh,2021,4,Outstanding Value in a Chromebook,"This is the closest thing I've seen to the perfect Chromebook. It's fast, the touchscreen works well, there's plenty of local storage (32 and 64GB versions exist -- I went for the 64GB model) if you want it, and the battery life just goes on and on. This is the first laptop I've owned that goes for days between charges with usage time of a few hours per day. You can even use it as a tablet if you want to: just flip the screen around and there you are!I have a few Intel Celeron-based Chromebooks of similar age from competing manufacturers and this thing handily outperforms all of them.A few releases of Chrome OS (around the version 76-80 mark, and again sometime around beta versions 87/89 when the kernel was upgraded to version 4.19) demonstrated buggy behavior on this platform, but that seems to be all gone now.If you're buying this today, you'll want to be mindful of Google's automatic updates expiration policy, which is set in mid-2025 for this model. (It'll be here sooner than you think!) You can still use the Chromebook after that time, though you will not get any further software updates. Intel and AMD-based Chromebook models can sometimes be made to run other operating systems. Hopefully someone will do the same for ARM based models such as this Lenovo C330. I can definitely see myself still using this after 2025, if the battery and SSD hold out, and I'm fairly sure both will.There's really only thing I've ever found lacking from the Lenovo C330, and that's a backlit keyboard. Had Lenovo equipped it with one, this truly would have been the perfect Chromebook.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",289,lenovo
1106,Amazon Customer,2020,1,Don't Buy- Lenovo Customer Service is Absolutely Horrendously Unhelpful,"Wow, what can I say.  For a product that is 5 months old let me list the ways that this has been a terrible experience.  Amazon, it's not your fault.  You need to stop selling Lenovo's products, though.1) The first day out of the box the unit failed to start up properly.  We used Lenovo's chat service and after zero troubleshooting attempts they decided that the unit was broken and we should mail it back to them for a repair/replacement.  It was Christmas morning, you try telling that to a kid.  After a few google searches, we figured out the obvious issue, and it started up beautifully.  This was my first foray into the most unhelpful customer service experience I've ever had.  Send it back??? OK, or try everything else first??2) After 3 weeks my son opened the unit and there was a hairline crack in the touchscreen from one corner to the next.  This never affected functionality, but one day while bored during COVID-19 lockdown, I again (stupidly) opened the chat and asked whether the screen could get repaired under a warranty because the reason for the break was not because we had done anything to damage it.  The answer was no, I should drop it off at BestBuy and someone there could decide whether the repair would cost me or be free.  Not during state lockdown, thankyou - a mother needs it for her kid to do distance learning.  The chat agent entered a ticket on my computer to document the broken screen but of course left out the information i provided on how it became cracked and that it was fully functional. How nice?3) In April, my son opened the laptop up to start his schoolwork and the Google chrome page continually refreshed every 8 seconds.  There was no way to prevent this from happening as the touchscreen and mousepad would disable every 5 seconds of the 8, so we could do limited things in those 3 seconds we had control of it before it re-set. So I tried chat.  Big mistake.  Lenovo chat does allow you to specify that you need troubleshooting and technical service help, but the person I got said they don't do that online and to call someone.  I called the phone number.  Here is the ridiculousness that ensued:a) First lady says it's a software issue, not a hardware issue and my hardware is under warranty but software is not.  I need to upgrade and pay for software support so that she can troubleshoot the issue for me.  Pay?  Why? You have not asked me a single question to determine what could be going on. Though she reassure me repeatedly I have reached the right help center and can correct my problem, since I’m unwilling to blindly pay for her help for their product,  She says she can't help me but to call a different phone number where maybe someone can help me for free...?b) annoyed, I call the next phone number.  Might I mention each time I call this place so far their phone message immediately says they're having high call volume and to schedule a return phone call, but I humor them and wait this time.  The phone is answered within 2 minutes.  High call volume...or you want to avoid helping customers because you do not have one tech on staff who actually can do that?  The person who answered the phone asked for my name and phone number and then hangs up on me.c) I call another customer support number and the person who answers sounds vaguely like the first person I talked to but if it was she plays dumb after taking my name and computer serial number.  This woman tells me that the reason google chrome is refreshing itself every 8 seconds is A HA! because I have a cracked screen on the unit and it’s not a functional touchscreen any longer (are you some omnipotent being?)  and this Entire issue is surely due to the crack in the screen so she can't help me. No other questions asked by the way. I say that is absurd, I can use the touchscreen for several seconds without issue and it’s been fully functional for months.  She tells me to take it to a local place to have it serviced because she can't help me over the phone.  When I remind her that my state is in COVID-19 lockdown, she tells me that it's pronablu, definitely a Google issue and to CALL GOOGLE for support with their software!d) not that google would have helped rather than send me back to Lenovo, Google is closed due to COVID-19 and their contact through chat was impossible to find online as well.We ended up powerwashing the unit.  Fixed.  Why couldn't one of the 4 people I contacted with Lenovo run down a few scenarios with me and end up at the same conclusion as my 10 year old did?  DO NOT BUY FROM THIS ABSURD COMPANY IF YOU WANT A PRAYER OF SUPPORT FOR THEIR DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",289,lenovo
1107,Matthew Stearns,2021,5,Great for a tablet replacement for older parents,"For the price, it is a good buy. My father had an issue with using a regular laptop for streaming (he needed something with an HDMI cable to plug into his TV). The laptop I gave him was of good quality, but had an older hard drive (not SSD) so it would take awhile to boot up, and it wouldn’t run as fast as I would like. This is a simple chromebook that is just what I would consider a decent option, boots up quick, runs pretty fast, stream quality and screen is acceptable, and it comes with a full size HDMI port, on top of usb c which is what it uses to charge as well. I also created a new google account and logged it into my own computer so if he does need help, I can use googles remote access to help him remotely! I would recommend this for anyone who either needs a laptop for web browsing, a light workload such as document creation or online school, maybe a younger child’s first “real” computer. It is also pretty compact and light so I would recommend for traveling, however I can not speak to the durability, but it seemed stable. I would not recommend it for gaming unless it’s gaming on a tablet. I would also not advise anyone who’s in need of a lot of build in storage.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",289,lenovo
1108,Steven H,2021,3,"If you had a Windows OS or Apple OS 2in1 touch laptop previously, expect a downgrade","So I have a love/hate relationship with this laptop. There's a bunch of pros and cons. Let's get to the pros first. Pros : Fires up instantly as soon as turned on and easy setup as soon you first get it. Takes less than 5 minuets to setup. Easy to navigate and download apps. If you already have google chrome setup on another device everything comes back just the way you had it. Really simplistic in design and is light weight and durable (it probably can handle a modest accident without breaking or the screen shattering). The screen does not wobble like some other 2in1's. Apps and other programs do not lag and fire up quickly. Now here is the dreaded cons. Cons: If you are not used to a Chromebook it is a super awkward OS! Nothing made complete sense to me about the OS from the start. I got used to it but it still is weird to me. The sound quality is subpar, it does not get loud enough for my taste either. The screen resolution is about as good as the original Kindle fire HD resolution circa 2012 - pretty much years behind to the current technology resolution. 64 gigs storage is simply not enough space to store music, pictures and movies, if you have google cloud that's your best bet to go about storage. This is not a gaming device, if you are into gaming the hardware can not support an intricate modern video game. The battery life is definetly not 9 hours! Maybe if you just left it on and did absolutely nothing with it, it can stay alive for that duration of time (on the flip side it does charge up fairly fast, about 1hr 30 mins). Lastly, it just does not have the feel of a laptop compared to Windows OS or Apple OS. I find myself getting frustrated with the way everything is setup on a Chrome OS.Overall not horrible, but not great. The reason I purchased this Lenovo was the price and wanted a touch screen computer to hold me over because my old HP touch 2in1 is all cracked and busted up. So I will use this one just for browsing the internet and other simplistic functions. Great for a kid to use and keep them occupied but as an adult it lacks functions that a real deal OS can provide. Expect a major downgrade if you go from Windows to this OS and just in general just a major downgrade. This would be state of the art if this was released in the early 10's(?). Hope this was insightful. 4/10 is my grade on this efficient yet awkward device.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",289,lenovo
1109,Lenny,2020,5,What I expected and a little bit more,"When I write a review for a product I tried to be fair. First of all let me say that I have purchased an Acer 11 inch Chromebook and returned it last week because it was well terrible. I read a lot of reviews on the Lenovo, watch a lot of YouTube videos and I was fairly confident that I would be happy. I have to say I was not disappointed. The device shipped in typical Lenovo fashion and not too fancy packaging power cord small little booklet actually a pamphlet and the device itself. First things first the bad. There's not much bad to say about this device if you expected to be a gaming machine you will be disappointed it's a Chromebook. The display is IPS although it's slightly washed out the colors but sharp enough. The main drawback is the lack of ports there is one USB 3.1 and of course the USBC that is used for the power cord. You could use adapter and have 2 USB ports but this was she would be much better suited at least in my mind if it had at least two USB ports. Secondly the SD card, full size by the way sticks out way past the form factor making it not really a good way to store data. Unfortunately it doesn't go all the way in the body and it should. And last is it's White blizzard white is the only at color it comes in I don't know what's up with that. Now for the good and there's lots of goodness here. The quad-core mediatek processor is fast, at least fast in terms of what a Chromebook is. The touchscreen highly responsive the touchpad does not feel cheap and works really well although full disclosure I like to use a mouse. The case itself is made of plastic but it feels solid is no bending just a really nice quality filled to the tablet / Chromebook. Nice a tablet / Chromebook because it really is a Chromebook or laptop it doesn't work real well as a tablet it's a little big keyboard is on the other side but it works real good in tent mode that's for sure.  Bottom line I will be keeping this this makes the perfect little laptop to carry with me","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",289,lenovo
1110,JEL,2019,4,My wife likes it..,"We really like the wide viewing angle good sound system . Younger people may not appreciate that as much as we do because our hearing & sight is not as good as it was many years ago,  Resolution could be better but for the most part is easy to see and hear.My wife has been using the C330 almost exclusively after we purchased it. There are several android apps that do not work well but the android apps she needs these days do work OK and that is all that is important for now. She did not like using the GMAIL app, so we turned on the linux option and installed the linux version Thunderbird mail .  Thunderbird mail  takes a little longer to start up than the other apps but seems to work very well. This is an ARM device so many of the applications that work on the Raspberry Pi etc will work on this device. Once installed the program icons can be placed on the shelf to be started as any other app..There is/was a learning curve as the Chomebook does not have all the settings where  android devices normally keep the same settings.It appeared you must keep it in developer mode to run apps from unknown sources making it less desirable for us to access the Amazon App store. Switching to and from developer mode requires a complete reset, but as soon as you log in to Google your settings and apps are restored. It takes a few minutes, so it is not something you want to do often.In tent mode the Lenovo Chomebook is nicer than using the Samsung 8.1 tablet on a stand.  We used a wireless mouse at first but found it easier to just use the touch screen.  However the touch screen does not work as good as the regular android devices we  own.  We did play with the ""text"" mode where you write on the screen and it adds it to your document, fun but not for us.Overall, we are happy with the purchase, we did not want to spend a lot of money for a high priced quality Chromebook until we knew we would actually like using it.  As others have noted, this Chrome box is pretty nice, for the most part easy to use and probably more secure than most regular laptops.  Google's Chrome OS is getting better but in it's current state of development it is good enough for us to use every day.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",289,lenovo
1111,MR X,2019,4,This is an initial review from a first time Chromebook user and subject to re-review.,"My first impression is how did I ever do without it. I am a longtime computer user starting with a ""Sinclair"" that used a cassette  recorder for a hard drive . Then the Commodore  64 came out  and I had one of them. Eventually got a Desktop with Windows 3.1  then Windows got fancier every time , the last one I really liked was XP. I also had a IBM mainframe that came complete with all the huge disk drives  and a 6 ' wide printer and all the operating manuals and took a 16 ' box truck to move. Then Microsoft changed to Windows 7 , liked it OK but it got worse and worse with updates and then the notice about  quitting support and get Windows 10 or else! Well for me its else! I have tried Win 10  and absolutely hated it. Good bye Microsoft!I read all the reviews on every brand of Chromebook that I could afford being a disabled Vet. I decided on this Lenovo C-330. Ordered it on 7/16/2019 and got it the next day. Had no trouble whatsoever with setup , I followed the setup guide  and figured it would take hours to charge the battery and then do the setup. I let it charge for about 30 minutes and then decided  to take a look. I  was surprised that ir was fully charged and in seconds it had booted up, updated its self and all my stuff was available from my old computer. The only thing that didn't meet the description was that the spec's said it had a Micro SD card slot and this one has a full size slot. Sure it has a small keyboard but I can only use 2 fingers anyway and  use a mouse to browse with and the touch screen to read books so its no hardship to me. All in all  if you are a fence sitter like me don't wait any longer and buy your self a Chromebook !The only thing this machine needs is more USB ports (I have a port on order)  and make sure to print out the PDF  user guide on Amazon since the enclosed one with the machine is  one page folded 2 ways and the PDF is 20 + pages.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",289,lenovo
1112,Anthony,2020,1,Horrible costumer service.,"I bought this product less than a month ago for my son’s online schooling.At first it worked perfectly. Great computer. Loved it. Then it stopped charging. Which I was bummed about but understand that things happen. I knew I had purchased the warranty and I am still within the 30 day Amazon warranty so I thought this would be an easy process to get a replacement.Boy, was I wrong!I spent 2 HOURS being passed back and forth between the Warranty company and Amazon.  Amazon offered a replacement but said I needed to file a claim with the extended warranty company. When I spoke with the warranty company they said that Amazon would need to replace the computer because it was still within the initial 30 days, understandably.After speaking to an initial amazon rep who was unable to help me and kept asking me if I’ve tried plugging it in in another outlet, I asked to speak with a supervisor and was transferred to Mary.Mary offered the worst costumer service I have EVER received from Amazon. Mary proceeded to tell me to “wait until I get to 30 days, then file a claim with the warranty company.” I expressed that I already spoken with the warranty company and they already knew of the situation and that they said that amazon needed to replace the computer. Mary kept repeating the same information saying that after 30 days the warranty company would cover it. I told her again that would not wait until the 30 days and that my concern was that the warranty company would not cover it because they had already been informed there was an issue with the laptop prior to the 30 days. Mary then proceeded to make a 3 way call to the warranty company and was told exactly what I told her by the warranty company. The warranty rep literally told Mary “this is not the costumers fault, please take care of the costumer and replace it.”When we hung up with the warranty company Mary continued to give me the same information over and over again.I told Mary (while she was talking) that I was very frustrated and that I didn’t understand why she continued to repeat herself she said “can I talk?” I was shocked that a supervisor felt that was appropriate! When I asked to speak with another supervisor or her supervisor she told me “I am the last point of contact.” 🤣 So apparently Mary runs Amazon, guys. She’s the last one we can speak with.To be clear Amazon offered me these options:Replacement  through the warranty company, but the warranty company wouldn’t replace it and Amazon didn’t have it “in stock.”$60 dollars for “repair costs” when I asked if I could repair the computer. My son is using it for school so we don’t have the option of not having a computer. But when I asked what that would do to my warranty Mary could not answer so I declined because $60. Not to mention that would not cover a repair.Then they offered a full refund, which I ended up taking and agree a refund is fair. One note about the return is that Mary wanted to schedule a UPS pick up for tomorrow to return the computer but my refund would not be in my account for 5-7 business days. I made it very clear that because of the confusion and lack of helpfulness I will not be sending the computer back until my full refund is in my bank account. I can only image the nightmare I would experience should I not get my refund and I’ve already returned the product.My main complaint is the costumer service from Amazon. It was HORRIBLE. To be passed around for 2 hours only to end up on the phone with the rudest “supervisor” (Mary) was mind boggling. It was very obvious that she couldn’t care less about my situation or helping me. Then for her to tell me that she is the “last point of contact” was frustrating and inappropriate.... but also quite comical. You are not the running the show for Amazon, Mary. I think somebody needs to clarify your position, sister. You are clearly confused. Some ( and by some I mean A LOT) of management & customer service training would be highly recommend for Ms. Mary. Her performance is screaming for help.Amazon has been easy to deal with in the past. It’s unfortunate that this is the treatment I received on an item that is a necessity in our household right now and was a pretty pricey purchase.The warranty company was easy to deal with and very polite.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",289,lenovo

1116,Anonymous P,2021,5,Bought 2 Years Ago,"I bought this computer in Feb of 2019 and it's still going strong! I'm pretty rough on it and while I have managed to crack the casing in a couple spots, it still works perfectly. The touchscreen looks nice and the computer is still as fast as can be.The touchscreen is super nice to use and I like the keyboard as well. The size is perfect for me and I like that it's so lightweight. The ability to adjust the screen from computer to flat out or tablet or a tent is great.It took me awhile to get used to storing photos and things like that. I do store a ton of stuff on the computer and don't have any extra storage added and haven't run out of space yet. I can view most documents and if I need to create or edit a Word Document or something like that, I can do it online with Office or Google's apps. Same with PDF's. The only downside is that you can't run Microsoft programs, obviously.  However you generally don't need to do that now anyways, with everything being online or available via app.I can download a lot of apps from Google Play, so that's nice! Game Apps can be downloaded too.The web camera's quality sucks pretty bad but it's functional. The volume can go up pretty high too!I use this computer pretty heavily during the work day and it easily manages to last through my 8+ hours of work entertainment without needing to be charged, even when I'm mostly running Youtube.The price point is good for a computer that's quick, durable, and lasts multiple years without issue.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",289,lenovo
1117,Tracii Kunkel,2020,4,just wish power adapter didn't die in first month,"Had to pick up a new Chromebook/Laptop device to start doing online therapy to help support mental health services through the COVID crisis.  Like many, my income has been cut so was looking for something that would ""do the job"" inexpensively. Got a great deal on this device and based on reviews and previous experience with Lenovo I took a chance. Could not have been happier for the past 3 weeks since receiving it.  (well, it doesn't run the NEWEST OS version, so I guess I could be a LITTLE happier, but this works great).  Then last night I needed to plug it in and recharge (this thing will go forever on a full charge by the way - I was seriously impressed).  At first it said that it wouldn't charge while turned on since it was a lower voltage charging device - but this was the Lenovo charger that it shipped with. Then it stopped charging altogether. I've tried different wall outlets, even switched the cable that plugs from the converter part to the wall - no luck. Was able to recharge it overnight plugging it from a standard usb-c into a wall adapter with it off, but unfortunately as of this morning the OEM power supply is junk.  and now I have just a few days to decide whether or not to return this for refund or try to pick up a new power supply somewhere.  As I still need this for work I'll probably have to do the latter, but I hate to have to sink money into it already less than a month in use. Other than that though - the device itself is awesome.  And well worth the additional money I did already spend picking up a hardshell case and keyboard cover to protect it. (another reason why I will probably just try to pick up a new power supply).","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",289,lenovo
1118,The Engineer,2019,5,Confessions Of An Orthodox Laptop User,"When they first came out, I was a strong critic of Chromebooks.  To me, a Chromebook was nothing more than an ADM-3A incarnate; connected to the cloud, instead of a mainframe.  But as Chromebooks started adding Chrome OS, Android and now Linux; I decided that I should get one, to carry around with me on trips; that did not require me to have access to a Windows Pro system.The hardest decision I had to make about this particular purchase, was if I should get the 64gb ""Amazon's Choice"" unit that was actually being sold by Lenovo; or a more expensive 32gb unit sold by other sellers, because their product titles included the words ""Newest 2019.""  Rest assured, when my 64gb unit arrived, the ""Manufactured"" date on the box was only 2 weeks old.While you are waiting for your order to arrive; it helps to pre-create a Google account, just for the Chromebook.  You can setup & customize a Chrome profile exclusively for use by the Chromebook; and then ""Add"" your other Google accounts to that Chrome profile.  This will speed things up when your Chromebook arrives, because you can just log into that Google account & Chrome profile; and your Chromebook is ready to go.  The advantage of this, besides setup speed, is that you won't clutter your Chromebook's login screen with more than one account choice.Be sure to update your version of Chrome OS.  As of the late March 2019 manufacturing run, version 70 comes installed.  You need at least version 72, if you expect to run Linux, from the get-go.For right now, the only thing that really surprised me about the unit, which may or may not be a ""standard Chromebook thing,"" is that I have (until now) never seen a physical keyboard that was labeled with lower case letters on it!  Speaking of the keyboard, for those who are wondering, the keyboard is disabled after the hinge goes beyond 180 degrees.  It does feel ""weird"" however, to feel the keyboard pressing against your fingers or lap, when using the Chromebook in tablet mode.********** 2019-04-27 Update **********Because the display side of the clamshell is so lightweight; when used in ""laptop mode,"" it is very sensitive to motion transfer, and may show signs of noticeable vibration.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",289,lenovo

I knew I needed a replacement before it completely died. This product is great - similar to the one I had, but obviously new and has a lot of life in it. The only issue I've noticed is that it can be a bit slow at times and if it is struggling the whole system will shut off and restart.

1125,Kathryn G,2019,5,"Better than my HP. Solid, beautiful Chromebook.","I'm new to Chromebooks but not new to computers. I am an old soul who learned DOS and so I'm most happy with something like Linux and therefore the Chrome OS being based off Linux and the ability for newer Chromebooks to run Linux and open source programs like LIbreOffice are extremely important to me. I recently spilled a whole glass of wine right onto my HP Chromebook 14 therefore I had to buy a new one (even after taking the laptop apart to dry it out). This Lenovo is beautiful. The quality is far greater than the HP piles of junk out there. The screen is magnificent for such a cheap little thing. I like the fact I can use my Logitech Blutooth keyboard and therefore hopefully never spill anything again. That's the beauty of Chromebooks though - everything was backed up online and I didn't really lose much. Picked up where i left off with this wickedly good Lenovo. I have used a lot of machines - including Macs and Dell. I don't feel the price for those things are justified in anyway unless you are a full time graphics dev or designer and need heavy overpriced programs like Photoshop. There are superb alternatives with open source. Inkscape, GIMP, Scribus...and more. Cheap Chromebooks can't do everything but they are getting better all the time. I highly suggest updating Chrome when you buy this laptop, restart it then open settings and turn on Linux Beta. Learn about the programs you can run and how intelligent Linux is at installing them.Overall I love the size of this Chromebook. The screen is clear and gorgeous. Resolution is wonderful. Wish the laptop had more than one standard USB port but I'll manage. (I back up all locally kept files onto a USB drive or sometimes Google Drive). Touchpad seems responsive. The ability to use the laptop as a computer or tablet is fluid and no complaints. Solid build and it looks overall like something way more expensive yet my bank account or credit card isn't bloated because there is a fruit logo on this thing. Very happy with this purchase, would consider buying another one.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",289,lenovo

So why not save some money. For a thousand bucks this exceeded my expectations, it runs triple A games flawlessly with no problems at all. It’s super fast out of the box. Only bloatware it came with was McCafé so I didn’t do much cleaning, it was ready game. I never paid attention to Lenovo before, didn’t know they make good gaming laptops but actually this laptop looks good, it doesn’t scream I’m a gamer, I can take it out in class and at the library without gaining much attention, Very stealth looking. It’s all plastic but the build feels solid. The fans are loud as always with any gaming laptops. The keyboard is soft, feels good to type on. The best thing is that the laptop is upgradable, the 2x RAM, 2x SSD, Wi-Fi and battery are easily accessible without voiding warranty, yes Lenovo allows those upgrades so don’t worry. The hybrid mode aka mux switch is good to have too. The screen looks good without even calibrating it. There are lots of air vents specially a huge vent under the laptop so very good cooling. If you’re on a budget student gamer well this is a good choice for you. For a thousand bucks you get an AMD Ryzen, RTX series, SSD, dual channel RAM, IPS fast monitor, Mux switch, windows 11, 3 months xbl ultimate sheesh can’t beat that.","Lenovo - Legion 5 - Gaming Laptop - AMD Ryzen 7 5800H - 16GB RAM - 512GB Storage - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050Ti - 15.6"" FHD Display - Windows 11 Home - Phantom Blue",1099,lenovo

1148,Syrus Sheely,2022,5,Overall very good for price," This review is for the Lenovo Legion 5 Gaming Laptop, 15.6"" FHD Display, AMD Ryzen 7 5800H, 16GB RAM, 512GB Storage, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050Ti, Windows 11 Home, Phantom Blue.Everything is perfect and beautiful other than the dead pixel it came with.Pros:- Feels sturdy and durable.- Has a ton of port for I/O! Their positioning, amount and selection is way better than most of laptops nowadays.- The keyboard feels very comfortable and it looks beautiful with its 4 zone RGB backlighting.- The touchpad feels very soft and responsive.- The arrow keys are not cramped into the keyboard layout and take advantage of the extra space.- It does come with a webcam and a kill switch to fully disconnect it if needed.- The 165hz FHD IPS display is gorgeous.- The speakers sound very good, above average for a gaming laptop.- It has lots of ventilation to keep it as cool as possible under stress.- The lid design is much more subtle and professional than the Legion 5 Pro.- Minimum backlight bleed, almost none at all.Cons (See attached video for the ones related to the screen):- Not enough quality control, mine came with a dead pixel and found online that it is a common issue.- Just nitpicking here, but for my liking, ethernet port is upside down, always needs to lift the back of the laptop to unplug as the lock pin is at the bottom.- Power brick (A/C Adaptor) is quite big and heavy.- Has some backlight bleed.Mine was sealed and never opened, that's why I'm pretty sure it is an assembly line defect, however, I decided to keep it as I don't want to run the risk of receiving a replacement unit with more impactful flaws, and also I don't want to be going back and forth returning a bunch of units until I get a 100% perfect one.I would've given this 5 stars and great recommendation if it didn't come with a dead pixel, but I can't because it makes my eyes itch whenever I notice that it's not dust, but I'll cope by using dark mode everywhere I can.Other than that, for $1,030, if you do get a perfect unit, this is an exceptional deal.","Lenovo - Legion 5 - Gaming Laptop - AMD Ryzen 7 5800H - 16GB RAM - 512GB Storage - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050Ti - 15.6"" FHD Display - Windows 11 Home - Phantom Blue",1099,lenovo

1150,Sebastian Cintron,2022,5,,"I had been looking at this specific computer for a while and was going to buy it directly from Lenovo since the price matched the one here on Amazon. But that was the base model with a worse graphics card, screen, refresh rate, ext. I don’t remember well anymore because I got it almost two months ago but there was 5 or 6 higher end features that would have cost nearly $2000 if I had gotten it directly from Lenovo. The battery life is poor and it can’t go more than two hours of use without being plugged in, and in video games it performs significantly worse unplugged than plugged in. But putting that annoyance aside the machine works great and is a beast at running games. I’ve yet to get a game that it wouldn’t run over 60fps and it runs warzone on max graphics at around 115-125 frames. I’m not being paid to say this so you can trust my review if you’ve read this far. It’s a good investment if you aren’t too concerned about battery life.","Lenovo - Legion 5 - Gaming Laptop - AMD Ryzen 7 5800H - 16GB RAM - 512GB Storage - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050Ti - 15.6"" FHD Display - Windows 11 Home - Phantom Blue",1099,lenovo

Needless to say, it can run games that are power-hungry like Elden Ring and Monster Hunter World smoothly, although the graphics may not be top-notched, the frame rate is pretty consistent and loading time is very good.Apart from gaming, it can handle software like SolidWorks, Fusion360, MATLAB and ANSYS very well. The response rate and calculation speed is amazing and the smoothness during modelling is very appreciated as an engineering student with multiple projects.Overall I highly recommend this laptop to students studying engineering and want to game during leisure.","Lenovo - Legion 5 - Gaming Laptop - AMD Ryzen 7 5800H - 16GB RAM - 512GB Storage - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050Ti - 15.6"" FHD Display - Windows 11 Home - Phantom Blue",1099,lenovo

1158,Amazon Customer,2022,2,I got ripped off by Amazon!,"I bought this item for $1089.99 a week before it went down to $949.99. When I called Amazon to get the difference refunded, they refused and said I have to return it and re-purchase it and that the fund will be back on my card in 5-7 days. It makes no sense why a business like Amazon would rather lose my sale entirely but you bet I will be returning this and not repurchasing it through amazon. You can thank your customer service rep I spoke to for not understanding how businesses and loyalty works.The other reason why I am returning it is that while the laptop is decent. It has issues. The RGB lights are a bit annoying as it is not smooth in its transition and actually an eye sore in my opinion. I also noticed the laptop cannot game properly if its not constantly connected to the power source so do not expect it to be mobile as intended. It has to remain plugged to keep up with frame rates at all times or expect lag. Also its not a touchscreen or mine doesn't work so I don't know why that option is even there for review.Overall, decent laptop. Poor customer service through Amazon. Maybe buy a similar model off Best Buy who treats customers better.","Lenovo - Legion 5 - Gaming Laptop - AMD Ryzen 7 5800H - 16GB RAM - 512GB Storage - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050Ti - 15.6"" FHD Display - Windows 11 Home - Phantom Blue",1099,lenovo

Quick fire up, minimal bloat software, slapped in another 1 TB drive, created my local account, updated everything, loaded MW and I was off to the races.  Great machine.

I have the HDR setting turned on with no issues.  4k will only run at 60 fps but the picture is outstanding and doesn't really task the processor or vid card.  I recommend the RAM upgrade.  It comes with 16 gig of ddr4 and is actually the sweet spot for most everything but boosting to 32 gig of ddr4 really gives it a lot more breathing room to perform.I would get a stand or something for airflow.

I’ve looked through Razer, Asus, Gigabyte mostly the big brands then I saw this Lenovo Legion and I thought to myself why I’m I looking at those high end gaming laptops when it’s my first gaming laptop and Knowing that I would probably just toss it around and it’ll just get wreck in my backpack and stuff. So why not save some money. For a thousand bucks this exceeded my expectations, it runs triple A games flawlessly with no problems at all. It’s super fast out of the box. Only bloatware it came with was McCafé so I didn’t do much cleaning, it was ready game. I never paid attention to Lenovo before, didn’t know they make good gaming laptops but actually this laptop looks good, it doesn’t scream I’m a gamer, I can take it out in class and at the library without gaining much attention, Very stealth looking. It’s all plastic but the build feels solid. The fans are loud as always with any gaming laptops. The keyboard is soft, feels good to type on. The best thing is that the laptop is upgradable, the 2x RAM, 2x SSD, Wi-Fi and battery are easily accessible without voiding warranty, yes Lenovo allows those upgrades so don’t worry. The hybrid mode aka mux switch is good to have too. The screen looks good without even calibrating it. There are lots of air vents specially a huge vent under the laptop so very good cooling. If you’re on a budget student gamer well this is a good choice for you.

And the fans on this thing are impressive, it maintains low temps and you can feel the air really blasting out of the sides, and it's not nearly as loud as my main PC.

1176,brissa,2021,5,amazing laptop for the price,"i upgraded from a 4 years old 230 dollar HP laptop that could barely run firefox with so much lag. so far this laptop is so much better and its amazing for the price. it may not be the most high end laptop with the best display or graphics card or processor or whatever but it does the job excellently for the specs it has. i didn't expect much from this laptop because its a midrange laptop but it blew all expectations away.i have only had this for like 3 days though, so i'll make an edit later if i encounter any problems.ABOUT SHIPPING:first off it was delivered by UPS. im very pleased with the speed at which this was delivered. i didnt expect it to be delivered so quickly considering i ordered it right before thanksgiving, but it actually came in on the same week that i ordered it (ordered on wednesday and it was delivered that very same friday!!!!).the packaging had very little damage to it. the lenovo box came inside an enormous amazon prime box that had no padding to stop the lenovo box from moving around during shipping. inside the lenovo box, the laptop was very snugly fit inside two styrofoam holders and didnt move at all when i shook it. laptop arrived in perfect condition.ABOUT THE LAPTOP:the battery on this thing is decent. its not the longest running battery but its also not the worst. its just ok. i mostly just have my laptop plugged into the wall with conservator mode on to preserve battery life.the screen is also ok. miles better than my old HP but its not a high end display. it has decent colors and the blacks look good to decent depending on your settings and calibration.its very fast and does multitasking with very little to zero lag. ive ran photoshop, firefox, and discord on it at the same time with no issues, which used to be impossible on my old laptop. i can run games like genshin impact in medium graphics settings with almost no lag. its good for light gaming. dont expect to be able to play a game like the witcher 3 or assasin's creed on this though.the speakers are not that good. theyre just ok. not as terrible as others are claiming, though. the speakers are at the bottom of the chassis which means that the sound can be amplified if you put it on a hard surface. without the amplification the sound is pretty quiet.one thing is that it tends to overheat when doing very intensive things like gaming. i suggest putting the laptop at an angle so that the air circulates better at the bottom if you ever do anything thats super intense on this.also it comes with a finger print reader (its decent) and a backlit keyboard. the backlit keyboard especially is what interested me in this laptop because its almost unheard of to have them in laptops of this price range.for lack of a better word, the camera is total shit. i wont be using the camera at all on this but if you need the camera for whatever reason than either buy a good webcam or shop elsewhere. it has a privacy shutter too.the chassis is this dark blue plastic thats made to look like brushed aluminum. i think it looks pretty. its a bit flimsy though. if you press down on it with minimal force itll flex, so treat this laptop with care. if youre the kind of person that needs a sturdy laptop than this probably isn't for you. after all you get what you pay for.all in all i dont have many complaints about this. i have my expectations tempered because i knew i wasn't going to get a high end laptop considering the price range, but this performed even better than expected. its a good buy for the price and i really really love this purchase so far.","Lenovo IdeaPad 3 14 Laptop, AMD Ryzen 5 5500U, 8GB RAM, 256GB Storage, 14.0"" FHD Display, AMD Radeon 7 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Abyss Blu",517,lenovo

1180,AH in MA,2022,3,"It's okay, but some shortcomings","As context, my prior laptop was a Macbook Pro, and I was looking to get away from Macs and have a functional replacement to do office work (i.e., MS Office type stuff) and telehealth/zoom meetings. I figured I did not need to spend a ton of money to get that. I really, really wish I had spent more. The camera is not very good, and I've gotten feedback from others that the mic is not good either. I could get peripherals to replace those, but I don't want to have to do that. The screen is great- wide screen is so much more functional than my old laptop, but the quality is just not what I have been accustomed to. The colors are wan comparatively, and it's harder to use in different lighting situations. It also needs to be at just the right angle to see colors properly. I do love that it has a keyboard/keypad combo, and the keyboard itself is satisfying for typing. The trackpad is meh but gets the job done. Better with an external mouse. Finally, the laptop is light and seems to run well overall (especially after removing some of the bloatware installed on it).Overall, it's fine for work that requires MS Office and general web surfing, but I am really disappointed with its performance on Zoom and Teams, and I now have my old, dying Mac hooked up for that purpose, and I switch between them. I work four hours per day on a telehealth zoom connection, so this computer is not as functional for me as I had hoped it would be.","Lenovo IdeaPad 3 14 Laptop, AMD Ryzen 5 5500U, 8GB RAM, 256GB Storage, 14.0"" FHD Display, AMD Radeon 7 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Abyss Blu",517,lenovo
1181,Michael L.,2022,3,No case option,"The computer is fine, for our daughter, for high school. My biggest problem is, there is no hard case protective option to buy for this laptop.

1182,Fult,2021,4,Value Ryzen Laptop,"First off, don't let the title scare you, it's a great deal. The screen, unlike previous iterations, is gorgeous for the price - crisp and detailed. You can probably find the specs elsewhere complaining about SRGB coverage, but for the average user, sub $500, it's great. Seems like it gets close to 300 nits, definitely bright enough indoors. Keyboard is very nice, not MacBook Air or the like, but very close - much better than Acer/Asus/Samsung. Trackpad along the same lines, very good overall, if you really want to nitpick, the clicking of it wasn't the best on the edges for right/left click. Sound was decent, definitely a laptop speaker and does not get too loud. Fan noise isn't noticeable unless you're used to absolute quiet, the fans spun up under load when setting things up and windows updates, quiet and not grating on the ears. Build quality won't wow anyone at the coffee shop but the plastic resembles brushed metal and it's appealing over, say, the millionth grey laptop. Moderately serviceable under the hood, with one ram stick being soldered on (4 gb). Ignore the other reviews bashing Amazon's delivery service instead of the product itself, this is a sleeper Windows laptop. Highly recommended for research/browsing, writing, and light gaming.","Lenovo IdeaPad 3 14 Laptop, AMD Ryzen 5 5500U, 8GB RAM, 256GB Storage, 14.0"" FHD Display, AMD Radeon 7 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Abyss Blu",517,lenovo

It runs GTA V and BeamNG on low settings at 45-60fps. It works smoothly with Photoshop, Blender and other workstations. Its just perfect for light gaming, browsing, editing pictures and more.

1268,Lewguitar,2022,4,I like the laptop a lot.  I dislike the blue hue the screen gives to all images.,"The computer itself works fine and does everything I want it to.  I like it very much.  It actually seems to function a little faster and easier than my Lenovo Yoga.  But I like the screen of my Yoga much more.  The screen of the Ideapad 3 adds a light blue hue to everything, especially photos.  This throws the colors off.  It also feels ""depressing"" - it affects my mood.  There are ways to change the display to cooler shades or warmer shades but to my eyes, the options look worse than the factory color tones.  Maybe this can be corrected, but my Lenovo Yoga looked great right out of the box.  This Lenovo Ideapad3 does not.  I think some of the problem has to do with the angle the screen is opened to.  The image fades or deepens, deepening upon the angle you are viewing the screen from.  My Yoga is not this sensitive, and the screen has a sharper image.  That's my only complaint.  The colors of the screen don't look as vivid or sharp or accurate, as they do on my Lenovo Yoga.","Lenovo IdeaPad 3 Laptop, 15.6"" HD Touchscreen, 11th Gen Intel Core i3-1115G4 Processor, 20GB DDR4 RAM, 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD, HDMI, Webcam, Wi-Fi 5, Bluetooth, Windows 11 Home, Almond",600,lenovo

The computer is fast and capable of utilizing all of the software needed for my day to day work and internet streaming is pretty instant when it comes to loading. The main negatives I have are in regards to the hardware. The power cable is short and the part with that plugs into the outlet is a bulky brick that falls of easily due to the weight. Also, the brightness when plugged in is significantly brighter than when it is not plugged in. I tried to override the display settings so that it is just as bright when it is unplugged but it will not let me do it in the simple commands menu.

1308,Lewguitar,2022,4,I like the laptop a lot.  I dislike the blue hue the screen gives to all images.,"The computer itself works fine and does everything I want it to.  I like it very much.  It actually seems to function a little faster and easier than my Lenovo Yoga.  But I like the screen of my Yoga much more.  The screen of the Ideapad 3 adds a light blue hue to everything, especially photos.  This throws the colors off.  It also feels ""depressing"" - it affects my mood.  There are ways to change the display to cooler shades or warmer shades but to my eyes, the options look worse than the factory color tones.  Maybe this can be corrected, but my Lenovo Yoga looked great right out of the box.  This Lenovo Ideapad3 does not.  I think some of the problem has to do with the angle the screen is opened to.  The image fades or deepens, deepening upon the angle you are viewing the screen from.  My Yoga is not this sensitive, and the screen has a sharper image.  That's my only complaint.  The colors of the screen don't look as vivid or sharp or accurate, as they do on my Lenovo Yoga.","Lenovo IdeaPad 3 Laptop, 15.6"" HD Touchscreen, 11th Gen Intel Core i3-1115G4 Processor, 20GB DDR4 RAM, 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD, HDMI, Webcam, Wi-Fi 5, Bluetooth, Windows 11 Home, Almond",600,lenovo

The computer is fast and capable of utilizing all of the software needed for my day to day work and internet streaming is pretty instant when it comes to loading. The main negatives I have are in regards to the hardware. The power cable is short and the part with that plugs into the outlet is a bulky brick that falls of easily due to the weight. Also, the brightness when plugged in is significantly brighter than when it is not plugged in. I tried to override the display settings so that it is just as bright when it is unplugged but it will not let me do it in the simple commands menu. Those annoying things that I just mentioned are manageable if you do not mind getting up a little more often to deal with the charger.

1318,Amaze-O-Tron,2021,4,Best laptop you can buy for the money but...,"I love this laptop, after reading reviews and shopping around for a few weeks I decided the Lenovo Flex 5 was going to give me the most bang for my buck.You won't find a better performing Ultrabook in the $800 range.Equipped with an AMD 4700U 2ghz boosting to 4.1ghz 8 core 8 thread processor and 16gb of 3200mhz ram, this thing is a beast.It'll play just about any game you throw at it at 60+fpsOn top of that you get a solid keyboard, Lenovo's trusted FN+Q 3 mode Silent, Battery Saver, and Turbo hotkey functions.A rigid frame, a great trackpad, a fingerprint reader, 720p webcam with privacy lens, and great sounding speakers considering they're cased inside of a 14 inch Ultrabook.While I do love this laptop I will admit that it's not perfect.The battery life, while advertised at 10 hours, on this model works out to around 7 - 7.5 hours of moderate use. The models with the 4500u possessors should get closer to 8-9 hour battery life however I've only tested the 4700U model.The second caveat is the screen, a 1080p 60hz Touchscreen IPS, while for what it is this screen looks very nice and is very responsive to the touch, It doesn't get incredibly bright and while it does support HDR playback the screen itself is not HDR and only reaches a brightness of around 250 nits.Another thing worth mentioning is the built in wireless card is wifi 5, however it is swappable, wifi 6e cards are only around $40 so I'd recommend swapping that out if you do decide to purchase this laptop, you mite also want to pick up the optional charger, the one that comes with the laptop uses its only USBC port, while the optional charger plugs into a charger port.Also there is only one M.2 slot so if you want more memory you'll want to clone and swap the hard drive.All in all I think this is a great laptop and I'm looking forward to using is for many years to come.","Lenovo Flex 5 14"" Full HD 2-in-1 Touchscreen Laptop, AMD Ryzen 7 5700U, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Windows 11 Home",729,lenovo
1319,unidave199,2020,4,Believe the hype!,"You can see so many YouTube videos saying what a hot deal this is... and it IS!I am generally using this as an office adjunct, some light video processing, and some home utility funciton.I do not have the Lenovo pen or any other active pen so I can't speak to that.  But what I can see is that it is well built, solid feeling, and quality functions.  I can utilize the installed Microsoft Suite and OneDrive sync quite nicely and was able to buy a 2nd pin style power supply so I do not need to depend on the USBC port to charge this device.  I recommend it also because it is a single 'wall wart' and not a 2 piece brick style supply so makes travel a bit easier for me.The track pad works fine for me (after a little adjustment) and the battery can pull me through a couple of days of light office work.  The screen is just fine indoors and the touch function works great.I tiny wish is that it had a USB port on each side... but that is a minor nit pic... not a deal breaker. I am glad for the HDMI full size output for work and display functions.The screen swivels back all the way into tablet mode and woks great.  A small note though of tablet mode.  This does have a fan so will make some noise under load.  AND it is a little bit heavy to use one handed as a note taking clipboard. It is fine for short notes or lists but I would not want to carry it all day in tablet mode taking notes.I did have 2 'glitches' .  The closing of the lid should power this unit down.. but I find that sometimes, when I open it up later, the cursor doesn't appear back and I have to reboot it.  And the track pad.. if you touch the very sides, it will not move the cursor.  I am not sure if this is a feature or bug..  But I feel software updates should fix this.","Lenovo Flex 5 14"" Full HD 2-in-1 Touchscreen Laptop, AMD Ryzen 7 5700U, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Windows 11 Home",729,lenovo
1320,Sean D.,2021,5,Great for my needs.,"A lot of what computer you get depends on your needs.  I didn't expect to like this computer as much as I do.  It meets all my needs and overall I am very happy with my purchase 1.5 months later.The Ryzen processor is great.  Everything is very snappy and quick which makes it enjoyable to use.  Pretty decent battery life for normal usage at around 7 hrs.  I really like the touch screen.  It is enjoyable to use.My only con if I had to write one would be, it doesn't have that premium 'feel'.  As in the it uses this hard plastic for most of the material.  No finished metal as you would expect on the premium high priced products.  But I knew I didn't care about that.  For value of your dollar, I don't think you can beat this.I needed something that was good for the following:1. Taking Notes2. Decent Display3.  Decent Battery Performance4.  Browsing the web.5.  Light activities such as word docs, excel, etc.6.  No gaming though I think this would be able to handle light gaming.This laptop is great and I would definitely buy it again or recommend it to a friend. For the price, it is one of the best you can buy right now.

1322,Bryce,2020,4,High tier components in a low tier chasis,"It was a shame I didn't end up going with this laptop. The keyboard is just too sub-par compared to lenovo's own thinkpad lineup. The spec on this machine is insane, it rivals my main desktop computer which was top-tier for it's time only 3 years ago.But the fact AMD is not seriously considered by manufacturers (yet) means that the few options to get this god-tier CPU are in trash-tier chasis like this one. It's not overly cheap, but it's definitely not $900 worthy. The keyboard is just too unpleasant to type on for me. Maybe for most it will be fine, but if I kept this thing it would be docked 24/7, and then what's the point of a 2in1 at that point?It was close, but I ended up going with the L13 thinkpad just because of it's far superior chasis and keyboard.","Lenovo Flex 5 14"" Full HD 2-in-1 Touchscreen Laptop, AMD Ryzen 7 5700U, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Windows 11 Home",729,lenovo

The 8 - core processor with 16GB of DDR4 RAM is amazingly fast, the 512GB SSD is more than adequate, lastly the 1080p screen is a massive upgrade as is the Wi-Fi (I also added a mesh system to my home). There have been complaints about the brightness (250 nits) though, the only way you'd get a brighter screen is to spend a lot more money.

1324,youlie p.,2021,1,"Careful with the garanty , just one month , not good seller .the pc has different problems","The pc is good, the problem is the warranty. This review will talk about the properties of the computer vs price. But I will also talk about the risk if you buy with this seller. (It is not amazon or lenovo)This computer  has good price with this seller, the best I found, but it is because it does not cover any warranty after a month. The first month is cover by Amazon. After that Lenovo does not respond because it is not Lenovo the seller Amazon will not do it after the month and the seller will not answer your message. The computer is excellent for its excellent memory speed properties, not too heavy, the screen is not good outdoors, only closed spaces with no intense light, or they will not be able to see much and that is uncofortable. in my case the pc began to have a small sound that did not stop the computer, but it sounded like it was stopping when I opened more than two windows I waited for a month and 15 days, and it was a fatal error, I'm not sure if it's true of that this computer is new (when I validate the ID of the pc with Lenovo they doubted that it was new) careful. The first failure you have if you will buy it, no matter how small, send it to Amazon before the month. Whatever happens next is your responsibility.  As costumer, you are for your own, after this month they will be abandoned. If you are not unlucky like me, the computer will be in good condition, and it is a very good computer compared to the price, but I would advise more to buy the yoga 6. That is now in Best Buy for almost the same price or less and has a better guarantee of damage and weighs less. If you find other seller and good price, I suggest this one. The tactic screen works fine. This computer is great, because what it has, the problem is the seller who is not Amazon or Lenovo is an external person who does not respond.I always check the reviews I did with this one,I took the risk, and sadly I did not check the warranty.","Lenovo Flex 5 14"" Full HD 2-in-1 Touchscreen Laptop, AMD Ryzen 7 5700U, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Windows 11 Home",729,lenovo

1358,Amaze-O-Tron,2021,4,Best laptop you can buy for the money but...,"I love this laptop, after reading reviews and shopping around for a few weeks I decided the Lenovo Flex 5 was going to give me the most bang for my buck.You won't find a better performing Ultrabook in the $800 range.Equipped with an AMD 4700U 2ghz boosting to 4.1ghz 8 core 8 thread processor and 16gb of 3200mhz ram, this thing is a beast.It'll play just about any game you throw at it at 60+fpsOn top of that you get a solid keyboard, Lenovo's trusted FN+Q 3 mode Silent, Battery Saver, and Turbo hotkey functions.A rigid frame, a great trackpad, a fingerprint reader, 720p webcam with privacy lens, and great sounding speakers considering they're cased inside of a 14 inch Ultrabook.While I do love this laptop I will admit that it's not perfect.The battery life, while advertised at 10 hours, on this model works out to around 7 - 7.5 hours of moderate use. The models with the 4500u possessors should get closer to 8-9 hour battery life however I've only tested the 4700U model.The second caveat is the screen, a 1080p 60hz Touchscreen IPS, while for what it is this screen looks very nice and is very responsive to the touch, It doesn't get incredibly bright and while it does support HDR playback the screen itself is not HDR and only reaches a brightness of around 250 nits.Another thing worth mentioning is the built in wireless card is wifi 5, however it is swappable, wifi 6e cards are only around $40 so I'd recommend swapping that out if you do decide to purchase this laptop, you mite also want to pick up the optional charger, the one that comes with the laptop uses its only USBC port, while the optional charger plugs into a charger port.Also there is only one M.2 slot so if you want more memory you'll want to clone and swap the hard drive.All in all I think this is a great laptop and I'm looking forward to using is for many years to come.","Lenovo Flex 5 14"" Full HD 2-in-1 Touchscreen Laptop, AMD Ryzen 7 5700U, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Windows 11 Home",729,lenovo
1359,unidave199,2020,4,Believe the hype!,"You can see so many YouTube videos saying what a hot deal this is... and it IS!I am generally using this as an office adjunct, some light video processing, and some home utility funciton.I do not have the Lenovo pen or any other active pen so I can't speak to that.  But what I can see is that it is well built, solid feeling, and quality functions.  I can utilize the installed Microsoft Suite and OneDrive sync quite nicely and was able to buy a 2nd pin style power supply so I do not need to depend on the USBC port to charge this device.  I recommend it also because it is a single 'wall wart' and not a 2 piece brick style supply so makes travel a bit easier for me.The track pad works fine for me (after a little adjustment) and the battery can pull me through a couple of days of light office work.  The screen is just fine indoors and the touch function works great.I tiny wish is that it had a USB port on each side... but that is a minor nit pic... not a deal breaker. I am glad for the HDMI full size output for work and display functions.The screen swivels back all the way into tablet mode and woks great.  A small note though of tablet mode.  This does have a fan so will make some noise under load.  AND it is a little bit heavy to use one handed as a note taking clipboard. It is fine for short notes or lists but I would not want to carry it all day in tablet mode taking notes.I did have 2 'glitches' .  The closing of the lid should power this unit down.. but I find that sometimes, when I open it up later, the cursor doesn't appear back and I have to reboot it.  And the track pad.. if you touch the very sides, it will not move the cursor.  I am not sure if this is a feature or bug..  But I feel software updates should fix this.","Lenovo Flex 5 14"" Full HD 2-in-1 Touchscreen Laptop, AMD Ryzen 7 5700U, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Windows 11 Home",729,lenovo
1360,Sean D.,2021,5,Great for my needs.,"A lot of what computer you get depends on your needs.  I didn't expect to like this computer as much as I do.  It meets all my needs and overall I am very happy with my purchase 1.5 months later.The Ryzen processor is great.  Everything is very snappy and quick which makes it enjoyable to use.  Pretty decent battery life for normal usage at around 7 hrs.  I really like the touch screen.  It is enjoyable to use.My only con if I had to write one would be, it doesn't have that premium 'feel'.  As in the it uses this hard plastic for most of the material.  No finished metal as you would expect on the premium high priced products.  But I knew I didn't care about that.  For value of your dollar, I don't think you can beat this.I needed something that was good for the following:1. Taking Notes2. Decent Display3.  Decent Battery Performance4.  Browsing the web.5.  Light activities such as word docs, excel, etc.6.  No gaming though I think this would be able to handle light gaming.This laptop is great and I would definitely buy it again or recommend it to a friend. For the price, it is one of the best you can buy right now.

The spec on this machine is insane, it rivals my main desktop computer which was top-tier for it's time only 3 years ago.But the fact AMD is not seriously considered by manufacturers (yet) means that the few options to get this god-tier CPU are in trash-tier chasis like this one. It's not overly cheap, but it's definitely not $900 worthy. The keyboard is just too unpleasant to type on for me. Maybe for most it will be fine, but if I kept this thing it would be docked 24/7, and then what's the point of a 2in1 at that point?It was close, but I ended up going with the L13 thinkpad just because of it's far superior chasis and keyboard.","Lenovo Flex 5 14"" Full HD 2-in-1 Touchscreen Laptop, AMD Ryzen 7 5700U, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Windows 11 Home",729,lenovo

The 8 - core processor with 16GB of DDR4 RAM is amazingly fast, the 512GB SSD is more than adequate, lastly the 1080p screen is a massive upgrade as is the Wi-Fi (I also added a mesh system to my home). There have been complaints about the brightness (250 nits) though, the only way you'd get a brighter screen is to spend a lot more money.

1364,youlie p.,2021,1,"Careful with the garanty , just one month , not good seller .the pc has different problems","The pc is good, the problem is the warranty. This review will talk about the properties of the computer vs price. But I will also talk about the risk if you buy with this seller. (It is not amazon or lenovo)This computer  has good price with this seller, the best I found, but it is because it does not cover any warranty after a month. The first month is cover by Amazon. After that Lenovo does not respond because it is not Lenovo the seller Amazon will not do it after the month and the seller will not answer your message. The computer is excellent for its excellent memory speed properties, not too heavy, the screen is not good outdoors, only closed spaces with no intense light, or they will not be able to see much and that is uncofortable. in my case the pc began to have a small sound that did not stop the computer, but it sounded like it was stopping when I opened more than two windows I waited for a month and 15 days, and it was a fatal error, I'm not sure if it's true of that this computer is new (when I validate the ID of the pc with Lenovo they doubted that it was new) careful. The first failure you have if you will buy it, no matter how small, send it to Amazon before the month. Whatever happens next is your responsibility.  As costumer, you are for your own, after this month they will be abandoned. If you are not unlucky like me, the computer will be in good condition, and it is a very good computer compared to the price, but I would advise more to buy the yoga 6. That is now in Best Buy for almost the same price or less and has a better guarantee of damage and weighs less. If you find other seller and good price, I suggest this one. The tactic screen works fine. This computer is great, because what it has, the problem is the seller who is not Amazon or Lenovo is an external person who does not respond.I always check the reviews I did with this one,I took the risk, and sadly I did not check the warranty.","Lenovo Flex 5 14"" Full HD 2-in-1 Touchscreen Laptop, AMD Ryzen 7 5700U, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Windows 11 Home",729,lenovo

1366,LC A,2021,5,Superó mis expectativas,"Había tenido hasta el momento varias experiencias con Tablets android para realizar labores de computador en mi trabajo o mientras estaba de viaje, para no llevar mi laptop principal que es más grande y pesada. En general había tenido tanto experiencias buenas como malas, pero nunca habían llegado a compararse con la experiencia de un computador completo, en especial en cuanto a multitasking.Mi última tablet android ya necesitaba un cambio así que mi objetivo era buscar un computador o tablet 2 en 1 para usar como dispositivo secundario a mi laptop principal. Las tablets Android, como ya he dicho, no son las mejores respecto a la función multitareas, sus navegadores a veces corren las páginas en su modo móvil; y las laptops o tablets Windows que quería estaban fuera de mi presupuesto o tenian procesadores que no alcanzaban a correr el sistema operativo de manera rápida. Así que le quise dar una oportunidad a Chrome OS con la Lenovo C340, un sistema que nunca había usado pero que parecía tener muchas ventajas.Un mes después de uso estoy sumamente contento con esta tablet. Es muy liviana, con un tamaño perfecto para uso cómodo sin comprometer tamaño. Su navegador Chrome es la misma versión que una de computador, lo cual permite cosas desde navegación usual hasta edición de Office via google Docs. Es compatible con casi todas las apps de Android al ser compatible con play store pero permite usar varias ventanas a la vez, y su procesador Celeron N4000, que es algo lento para un S.O. más pesado como Windows, es perfecto y ágil para Chrome OS. La batería es increíble y puede durarme un día entero en el trabajo, Especialmente usando únicamente Chrome, ya que consume más baterías usando Apps de Android o Apps de Linux. ¡Y sí, tiene soporte para apps de Linux también!Tiene soporte para dos puertos USB C, ambos compatibles para poner un adaptador de USB C a HDMI (No tiene puerto HDMI nativo, pero ya tenía el adaptador, por lo que no tuve problema), y según la página oficial soportará Chrome OS con actualizaciones hasta 2026.No es perfecta, hay que decirlo; los bordes de la pantalla en especial en el inferior me parecen innecesariamente gruesos, y recomiendo a todos los que la vayan a comprar, comprar la versión de 64 GB ya que la que compré es de 32 GB y 2 días después solo me quedaban 8 GB de memoria disponible. Tiene soporte para MicroSD, pero las aplicaciones no se pueden instalar allí.En general recomiendo este Chromebook para toda persona que necesite un hibrido tablet-computador o requiera de un dispositivo para tareas básicas como office o navegación, así como personas que busquen un computador secundario. En mi caso, fue todo lo que necesitaba y hasta más.","Lenovo Chromebook C340 2-in-1-11.6"" HD Touchscreen - Celeron N4000-4GB - 32GB eMMC - Gray (Renewed)",140,lenovo

We dug right in and opened the box and I have to say this Chromebook looked new, brand new.  There was nothing that pointed to a refurbished unit.  The battery had some charge so it started up right away.  After the initial setup of users, language, locations, etc., we started putting it it to work.  The screen was bright and crisp.  The touchscreen is responsive and effortless in use.  We chose the smaller screen as it cut the weight and fit in our daughter's backpack so at home, she has a second monitor to work on any applications while the main screen is for video conferencing. This chromebook handles the added screen with out any issues.  The built in camera works great and produced very clean video.  I had a pleasant experience from ordering upto now.

1391,Calvin Sangster,2021,2,It was the thought that counted. Wishful thinking!,So I bought this for my wife for Christmas. I had high hopes for it and she was very excited. Once she turned it on and started going throb the motions to set it up it I saw her face get more and more disappointed. The keys were sticking and she couldn't type anything. Everytime she pressed a key 4 j's would pop up or 3 g's. We couldn't use the keyboard at all.  So in the box it goes and it goes back. Renewed or not you shouldn't go through that trouble right out of the box. The touchscreen seemed good and it's a nice looking laptop though despite the keyboard being a problem. But because of the good reviews we will try a replacement.

1406,LC A,2021,5,Superó mis expectativas,"Había tenido hasta el momento varias experiencias con Tablets android para realizar labores de computador en mi trabajo o mientras estaba de viaje, para no llevar mi laptop principal que es más grande y pesada. En general había tenido tanto experiencias buenas como malas, pero nunca habían llegado a compararse con la experiencia de un computador completo, en especial en cuanto a multitasking.Mi última tablet android ya necesitaba un cambio así que mi objetivo era buscar un computador o tablet 2 en 1 para usar como dispositivo secundario a mi laptop principal. Las tablets Android, como ya he dicho, no son las mejores respecto a la función multitareas, sus navegadores a veces corren las páginas en su modo móvil; y las laptops o tablets Windows que quería estaban fuera de mi presupuesto o tenian procesadores que no alcanzaban a correr el sistema operativo de manera rápida. Así que le quise dar una oportunidad a Chrome OS con la Lenovo C340, un sistema que nunca había usado pero que parecía tener muchas ventajas.Un mes después de uso estoy sumamente contento con esta tablet. Es muy liviana, con un tamaño perfecto para uso cómodo sin comprometer tamaño. Su navegador Chrome es la misma versión que una de computador, lo cual permite cosas desde navegación usual hasta edición de Office via google Docs. Es compatible con casi todas las apps de Android al ser compatible con play store pero permite usar varias ventanas a la vez, y su procesador Celeron N4000, que es algo lento para un S.O. más pesado como Windows, es perfecto y ágil para Chrome OS. La batería es increíble y puede durarme un día entero en el trabajo, Especialmente usando únicamente Chrome, ya que consume más baterías usando Apps de Android o Apps de Linux. ¡Y sí, tiene soporte para apps de Linux también!Tiene soporte para dos puertos USB C, ambos compatibles para poner un adaptador de USB C a HDMI (No tiene puerto HDMI nativo, pero ya tenía el adaptador, por lo que no tuve problema), y según la página oficial soportará Chrome OS con actualizaciones hasta 2026.No es perfecta, hay que decirlo; los bordes de la pantalla en especial en el inferior me parecen innecesariamente gruesos, y recomiendo a todos los que la vayan a comprar, comprar la versión de 64 GB ya que la que compré es de 32 GB y 2 días después solo me quedaban 8 GB de memoria disponible. Tiene soporte para MicroSD, pero las aplicaciones no se pueden instalar allí.En general recomiendo este Chromebook para toda persona que necesite un hibrido tablet-computador o requiera de un dispositivo para tareas básicas como office o navegación, así como personas que busquen un computador secundario. En mi caso, fue todo lo que necesitaba y hasta más.","Lenovo Chromebook C340 2-in-1-11.6"" HD Touchscreen - Celeron N4000-4GB - 32GB eMMC - Gray (Renewed)",140,lenovo

The price was the first thing that attracted us.  The package arrived earlier than it was originally stated and right away we notuced that the box and the packaging looked like it was a new item.  We dug right in and opened the box and I have to say this Chromebook looked new, brand new.  There was nothing that pointed to a refurbished unit.  The battery had some charge so it started up right away.  After the initial setup of users, language, locations, etc., we started putting it it to work.  The screen was bright and crisp.  The touchscreen is responsive and effortless in use.  We chose the smaller screen as it cut the weight and fit in our daughter's backpack so at home, she has a second monitor to work on any applications while the main screen is for video conferencing. This chromebook handles the added screen with out any issues.  The built in camera works great and produced very clean video.  I had a pleasant experience from ordering upto now.

1417,Amazon Customer,2021,4,Excellent for the price.,"For context: the laptop I had prior to this was a $200 HP that couldn't run more than 3 tabs of Chrome at once, so anything was going to be an improvement.The features I mainly use my laptop for are:-work (spreadsheets, Chrome tabs, designs on Canva, InDesign, etc.)-art (making pixel art in Photoshop and Aseprite)-gaming (Night in the Woods, Stardew Valley, Among Us, etc. The heaviest game I've run is Sims 3.)-meetings (Google Meet & Zoom)-writing (short stories & fiction)Immediately this laptop was a massive improvement. The keyboard is SO pleasant. It's backlit blue, which you can turn on and off. It has a numpad which is great if you work with spreadsheets/data. The responsiveness of the keys is satisfying. The touchpad has a good click, though it has no buttons (I like this, but others may not).Laptop runs beautifully. Startup is fast, runs multiple pages of Chrome no problem, and even loads up Adobe Creative Cloud as quickly as the desktop I have at work. If you want more speed, the 8GB RAM is upgradeable according to other reviewers. I'm considering it, but right now I have no need.The screen is matte and does a good job of reducing glare - not to mention the size is great for gaming, and the display, while a tiny bit muted, works just fine for the type of graphic design and pixel art I do.This is a gaming laptop, and the games I've run so far are so smooth and so easy to play. I have no input lag and I can run them on the highest graphics settings. To be fair, I don't play more intensive games, so I can't speak to that. But lighter games run smoothly and very well.My only 3 complaints about this laptop I have so far (I've had it about 2 weeks) are: the weight, the fan noise, and the battery. It's a little bit heavier than I'm used to carrying, but if you have it in a protective sleeve in a backpack, I doubt it'll be much of an issue. Just be prepared for thickness and a little bit of heftiness. The fan noise is my biggest problem. I was on a Google Meet call yesterday and within a couple of minutes, the fan kicked on and was pretty loud. It hardly ever runs, but the laptop does feel warm after a bit of use. I wouldn't recommend using this laptop in bed or anywhere it can't get good ventilation. And lastly, the battery life is a little bit shorter than I'd like it to be. It lasts a couple of hours, which is good, but be prepared to keep your charger with you if you're taking it outside your home.If you're like me, even budget laptops (below $1000) don't feel very ""budget."" Anything that costs more than $500 has me pretty hesitant. Rest assured, I've looked at laptops for probably eight months before committing to this one. So far, it's been worth the investment, and if you want a computer that can handle a number of tasks without lag or sluggishness, I'd highly recommend the Lenovo L340.",Lenovo - IdeaPad L340 15 Gaming Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 - 256GB Solid State Drive - Black,639,lenovo

This is a relatively cheap laptop as far as gaming laptops go and it works pretty well with really nice graphics.The only annoying thing about it is how quiet the speakers are. It’s really hard to hear it over anything; if my air conditioner is on I can’t hear the laptop most of the time.I have a separate speaker but I don’t always want to have to connect it if I’m laying in bed playing or watching something.

For that game, I can't complain at all. As long as you have it on a cooler mat it stays pretty cool considering it's all enclosed. I run mine in clamshell mode with a 27inch scepter monitor.

1421,Amazon Customer,2020,5,No better deal for the price,"I bought this for gaming, it runs red dead redemption 2 and Grounded on high settings flawlessly. I recommend setting your max processor state to 85% which will prevent any and all throttling or overheating issues as well as give your cpu a longer lifespan. Speakers are decent and quite loud, the weight and size are comparable to any other laptop meaning it doesn't stand out like other gaming laptops at all. When I'm not gaming on it, the fans are  quiet. But they are as loud as any other laptop when gaming unfortunately, nothing that can be done about it and not the sellers fault. The fan intake is on the bottom,which would make cooling pads more effective but trust me they won't be needed at 85% processor state. It came packaged nicely and arrived a day early, 100% recommend for anyone looking for a portable gaming machine or engineering students using AutoCAD or other software.",Lenovo - IdeaPad L340 15 Gaming Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 - 256GB Solid State Drive - Black,639,lenovo

A short time after she started to notice a glitch (see video)  that would happen with the screen. A part of the top left section would seem distorted until the mouse was dragged over the area. I returned the defective product for a full refund within the allotted time I'm allowed to do so. However,  Valinor Tech still took out over $100 from the refund for a 'restocking fee'. It makes no sense that I have to pay the price for a defective product, and when I disputed the claim, Valinor Tech said these types of errors have to be reported within the first 14 days, and I took too long, which is stupid and infuriating even though I returned it in time. They also said that they checked it and they did not see a glitch. So now it's my word against theirs even though there is a video to prove it.So thanks for nothing Valinor Tech. Next time, make sure your products break faster so people can get the refund they deserve.",Lenovo - IdeaPad L340 15 Gaming Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 - 256GB Solid State Drive - Black,639,lenovo

1457,Amazon Customer,2021,4,Excellent for the price.,"For context: the laptop I had prior to this was a $200 HP that couldn't run more than 3 tabs of Chrome at once, so anything was going to be an improvement.The features I mainly use my laptop for are:-work (spreadsheets, Chrome tabs, designs on Canva, InDesign, etc.)-art (making pixel art in Photoshop and Aseprite)-gaming (Night in the Woods, Stardew Valley, Among Us, etc. The heaviest game I've run is Sims 3.)-meetings (Google Meet & Zoom)-writing (short stories & fiction)Immediately this laptop was a massive improvement. The keyboard is SO pleasant. It's backlit blue, which you can turn on and off. It has a numpad which is great if you work with spreadsheets/data. The responsiveness of the keys is satisfying. The touchpad has a good click, though it has no buttons (I like this, but others may not).Laptop runs beautifully. Startup is fast, runs multiple pages of Chrome no problem, and even loads up Adobe Creative Cloud as quickly as the desktop I have at work. If you want more speed, the 8GB RAM is upgradeable according to other reviewers. I'm considering it, but right now I have no need.The screen is matte and does a good job of reducing glare - not to mention the size is great for gaming, and the display, while a tiny bit muted, works just fine for the type of graphic design and pixel art I do.This is a gaming laptop, and the games I've run so far are so smooth and so easy to play. I have no input lag and I can run them on the highest graphics settings. To be fair, I don't play more intensive games, so I can't speak to that. But lighter games run smoothly and very well.My only 3 complaints about this laptop I have so far (I've had it about 2 weeks) are: the weight, the fan noise, and the battery. It's a little bit heavier than I'm used to carrying, but if you have it in a protective sleeve in a backpack, I doubt it'll be much of an issue. Just be prepared for thickness and a little bit of heftiness. The fan noise is my biggest problem. I was on a Google Meet call yesterday and within a couple of minutes, the fan kicked on and was pretty loud. It hardly ever runs, but the laptop does feel warm after a bit of use. I wouldn't recommend using this laptop in bed or anywhere it can't get good ventilation. And lastly, the battery life is a little bit shorter than I'd like it to be. It lasts a couple of hours, which is good, but be prepared to keep your charger with you if you're taking it outside your home.If you're like me, even budget laptops (below $1000) don't feel very ""budget."" Anything that costs more than $500 has me pretty hesitant. Rest assured, I've looked at laptops for probably eight months before committing to this one. So far, it's been worth the investment, and if you want a computer that can handle a number of tasks without lag or sluggishness, I'd highly recommend the Lenovo L340.",Lenovo - IdeaPad L340 15 Gaming Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 - 256GB Solid State Drive - Black,639,lenovo
1458,Honey,2021,4,Speakers are SUPER quiet!!,"I’ve had this laptop for a few months now and I love it. This is a relatively cheap laptop as far as gaming laptops go and it works pretty well with really nice graphics.The only annoying thing about it is how quiet the speakers are. It’s really hard to hear it over anything; if my air conditioner is on I can’t hear the laptop most of the time.I have a separate speaker but I don’t always want to have to connect it if I’m laying in bed playing or watching something.

For that game, I can't complain at all. As long as you have it on a cooler mat it stays pretty cool considering it's all enclosed. I run mine in clamshell mode with a 27inch scepter monitor. Works perfect. Order up a larger SSD though...it's small.

1461,Amazon Customer,2020,5,No better deal for the price,"I bought this for gaming, it runs red dead redemption 2 and Grounded on high settings flawlessly. I recommend setting your max processor state to 85% which will prevent any and all throttling or overheating issues as well as give your cpu a longer lifespan. Speakers are decent and quite loud, the weight and size are comparable to any other laptop meaning it doesn't stand out like other gaming laptops at all. When I'm not gaming on it, the fans are  quiet. But they are as loud as any other laptop when gaming unfortunately, nothing that can be done about it and not the sellers fault. The fan intake is on the bottom,which would make cooling pads more effective but trust me they won't be needed at 85% processor state. It came packaged nicely and arrived a day early, 100% recommend for anyone looking for a portable gaming machine or engineering students using AutoCAD or other software.",Lenovo - IdeaPad L340 15 Gaming Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 - 256GB Solid State Drive - Black,639,lenovo

And forget being able to attend online classes with this thing, it can't last more than 5 minutes in a zoom session without freezing up and forcing you to close the app. So since this laptop can't even seem to do the most basic tasks for a student with online classes, I'll be returning it.","Lenovo - IdeaPad 1 14"" Laptop - AMD A6-Series - 4GB Memory - AMD Radeon R4 - 64GB eMMC Flash Memory - Platinum Gray - 81VS009GUS",251,lenovo

1491,sailorbear510,2022,3,It's not bad but you need to know a few things.,"I bought this on Black Friday for a good price in 2020 and it's a great all around computer if you know what you're expecting. Unfortunately the laptop is plagued by performance issues when it gets too busy. Windows Updates are a majority of the laptops performance problems.When you update the computer all other functions slow to a crawl until they are complete. So if you want to make this laptop your primary device, I suggest setting up your Wifi connection as a metered connection and also doing the updates overnight as it's going to take a very long time to complete the updates.Also I defer updates for several weeks so this helps the laptops performance. Disabling the Windows Update service in Administrative Services (services.msc command in the search box) helps too.Now when it comes to gaming, sure, this laptop is not equipped to handle that by nature. But it can game on a reasonable level. I have run Serious Sam 1 and 2, Unreal Tournament 2004, Unreal II and some other 3D graphical games and it runs them fine with acceptable default settings.Of course you will want to purchase an external hard drive (make sure it's USB 3.0) in order to run the games as this computer only has a 64 gb SSD. You also can't upgrade to Windows 11 even though the laptop device manager says it has TPM 2.0 and I don't know why the graphics processor don't qualify this system to upgrade. Not willing to take the risk either to do an unsupported install either.Overall this is a nice little system if you know how to get around its technical issues but if you are not savvy with computer issues and so forth this may not be the one for you. Have owned it for 2 years and still working fine.","Lenovo - IdeaPad 1 14"" Laptop - AMD A6-Series - 4GB Memory - AMD Radeon R4 - 64GB eMMC Flash Memory - Platinum Gray - 81VS009GUS",251,lenovo

That may not seem like a big deal at first (because surely the apps you need will be in the Windows Store), but there are a lot of things professional users need that are downloaded from the web or installed using other app management platforms.S mode means no Adobe software, no Apple apps, no non-Microsoft video conferencing apps, limited to no third-party security software--in short, if it comes to a Windows PC via a third party it doesn't come to S mode at all.That includes web browsers and that's a deal killer for many people. Windows 10 S mode users are stuck with Edge as their browser and Bing as their default search engine. To further restrict browsing matters, even if Chrome or Firefox were installed on an S mode computer it couldn't be set as the default browser, nor can the default search engine be changed.

1529,Silvie,2022,4,Worse than the SP4 for art,"I've had a Surface Pro 4 for years now and it has been used for all my personal and commissioned artwork since I got it. Before that, I had a SP3, which was also amazing -- so I'm a big Surface fan in general. Unfortunately, My Pro 4 is finally on its way out. The charging port is iffy, and it does not support Windows 11, meaning in a year or so it would be obsolete anyway. So, with the good sale on the 8s, which has 11 by default, I decided to upgrade.The 8 does have a bigger screen and an upgradable hard drive, which are the nicest features. But for art, it feels like a downgrade to a much cheaper tablet.Firstly, despite Microsoft saying it supports their specific models, none of the old Surface pens actually work fully. I tested OneNote, Paint, Medibang Paint Pro, and Photoshop, just to be sure it wasn't software-based.... but using any of those pens caused CRAZY line wobble on diagonals (see picture; straight line is when I tried using my finger). Drawing vertical or horizontal lines, no problem -- straight as your hand can go. Even using a ruler, attempting to draw any line that veers horizontally (or a circle/any shape that requires diagonal angles) produces a very strange squiggle that renders art impossible. I spent HOURS with Microsoft support, downloading drivers, reinstalling Windows, the whole works -- right up until they told me that it must be a device problem and to return it. So return it I did.... and the second one has the exact same problem. I drove all the way into town to a store that had a display model and tested my multiple pens on that one, and found even the display has that issue. Weird seeing as they even sold the old pens still!So, I tried upgrading to the Slim Pen 2, a nice extra hundred and twenty bucks that I didn't expect to have to spend since my SP4 pens were listed as compatible. But, it works! The pen is nice, too, though I am frustrated that I had to buy it at all. If the computer can't recognize the pens fully, IMO they shouldn't be listed as supported. If I had known that I needed the newest surface pen from the get go, I wouldn't be nearly as annoyed.But then, I found out that not ONLY do you need to use a very specific pen.... but you CAN'T use a screen protector. My SP4 worked with a good tempered glass screen protector on it, absolutely no problem. I went through 3 protectors over the last few years due to them cracking or getting scratched, so I definitely need a protector -- but upon installing any glass protector on the 8, I get the diagonal wobbly line issue AGAIN. For pete's sake. I tested 4 different screen protectors and had the same issue every time. I read reviews for every single brand's screen protector available on Amazon, and each one had a review saying they had touch issues after applying it.Eventually, I found a film-based matte protector that DOES work. It will maybe 1/20 times produce a wobbly line, but is far more consistent and usable. Only problem is that there was literally one option available for a film-based protector on amazon, it was awful to install and has bubbles, and the matte visibility makes it have an awful texture/distorts the picture a bit. Perhaps as the device gets older, more screen protectors will be developed for it that aren't annoying, but for now I feel forced into using it this way and I still find myself using my 4 despite its charging issues.Thus far I'm very disappointed in the 8. As a note-taking device or portable Windows tablet, it's fine,  but for art I'd pick an SP4 over it any day.","Microsoft Surface Pro 8-13"" Touchscreen - Intel® Evo Platform Core™ i7-16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Device Only - Platinum (Latest Model)","1,911.69",microsoft

1533,Jerry,2022,5,"Built wonderfully for Windows 11 but rather expensive. Windows Home, no micro-SD slot.","It was time to replace my old surface pro 3 which I bought new several years ago since it became very slow (only 8 GB of ram) and hot while the battery slowed to only 1 hour duration. I was torn between purchasing the Dell XPS 13 (which was about $300 cheaper) or the Surface Pro 8. I chose the Surface since I preferred the tablet functionality while retaining the option of a keyboard which is removeable (sold separately). I find it convenient to sit in my recliner with the tablet to read a book online.I bought the 32GB version of the Surface pro 8 since you cannot upgrade the memory later. Frankly, it is very fast, boots up within seconds, and I really enjoy Windows 11 on it. The touch screen is very responsive, especially with a new pen. Be sure to review and select the gesture controls to avoid erratic movements and find that place in settings to use your pen as a mouse. I use it with as a PC with a keyboard purchased separately and as a tablet when I read my books. It has two USB-C ports on the side (thunderbolt 4) which you could connect through a hub to a monitor (I have not). It connects nicely to my roku wirelessly as I cast the computer screen to the TV when needed to show pictures/videos. The surface pro 3 could not.After spending all of this money I was annoyed to discover it came with Windows Home and not Windows Pro, so I spent more money to upgrade it from the windows store. It does NOT come with a micro-SD card slot which the Surface pro 3 had!  But the hard drive is replaceable which is some benefit. Any further annoyances are due to getting use to Windows 11, which overall I like and will eventually upgrade my other PCs. Overall, I am very happy with this expensive purchase.","Microsoft Surface Pro 8-13"" Touchscreen - Intel® Evo Platform Core™ i7-16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Device Only - Platinum (Latest Model)","1,911.69",microsoft

I also purchased the flip down keyboard/cover which is a must for my use cases.  Long story short I was very pleasantly surprised by the display, performance, battery life, and form-factor with the fold down keyboard.

Now, I must let you know that these 2 units were brand new, sealed in the original box, with no fingerprint, and everything was clean and sealed.Also according to a Microsoft technician, he never heard of such a poor battery performance on a unit out of the box, much less 2 units.I performed both battery reports and was right on the spot.

I drove 3+ hours to take it in. The Best Buy had no idea what they were doing and seemed unaware that Microsoft service directs you to the store. They sent it off to Microsoft telling me there would be no charge, but it would take 3 weeks. I track it online it is sent to Microsoft and sent back without repair. I get a call that I have to drive back to the store and send it to Microsoft myself. There will be a $500 charge.If a product breaks easily and is impossible to repair, it is worthless.

1579,Duhkgeorge,2022,3,"Surface Laptop Studio (SLS) - Review of i7, 16 Ram 500G first gen unit","Quick take/summaryI love the function and feel of this machine.  It is a unique piece of equipment, where I mostly need a laptop, but occasionally I need a tablet for writing.  The slim pen 2 has no lag, which would be a deal breaker for me.Why are there two stars knocked off?  The batter life is not what was advertised and was enough to annoy me.  Standard browsing or video usage, after a few days of use and updates, you can probably expect about 6-8 hours of life.  This is far short of advertised, but that works for me, even if I'm mildly annoyed.  The big kicker is that when you game and the (very quiet and effective) fans come on, the battery life is 30-40 minutes at a full charge.  Something to be mindful of.  If that works for you, add a star for each battery issue that you don't mind, and that may be how you'll find the machine.  It's a beautiful piece of work that I don't regret purchasing, but the battery life is not as long lasting as Microsoft implied and the way they got their test results is not one I'd deem usable unless the room was pitch black.Review set-up:Summary above, Details below.***update 8/29/2022***I've knocked off two stars.  The battery life when using games that require power are is just unusable for more than a short 30-40 minute burst if you were fully charged.  I feel that really limits the usability for anyone who selected the model with the video chip.  I'm mostly annoyed at the false advertising.  The run time is decent if you're just doing every day work, but decent is 6-8 hours, which is also not what was advertised.  I reduced my refresh rate to 60, and that didn't seem to affect the gaming duration.  It was bad either way.Oh, and I also have managed to bump loose the power cord a few times without noticing.  Not as secure as I'd like when actually used on a lap.  On a desk, a non-issue.***update 2022_08_19***Just tried out the kingmaker game with battery only and boy does power drain fast.  If you're using the power with the fan running, I suspect you'll be lucky to get two hours out of the machine.  I got less than an hour, but the battery was not completely full, so heads up.  I have my screen refresh at 120, so maybe I'd get better battery life if I reduced.  I was just surprised it was so short.  My other laptop would chew through batteries when gamming too, but I got more life out of it.The pen, which I thought had a pretty secure magnet, does manage to get knocked loose.  It would be nice if Microsoft had some kind of notification when it disconnected.  I've noticed when I get up from my chair, it's been on my lap, and something falls to the floor.  It's always the pen.  Issues will likely depend on how you use it and if you wear things that can get caught by the pen, but heads up.I'm still happy with the purchase.  The power features I would be unlikely to really use unless plugged in.  In this sense, people that need the power are unlikely to be happy with this machine if they expected that power and prolonged battery life while unplugged.***update 2022_08_15***Finally had some time to load pathfinder kingmaker to the laptop.  The game instantly caused the fan to ramp up to dispel the heat.  The right side became very warm, both where my right hand palm rests while I type, and underneath on the right side.  Warm, but not burning to type on or on the lap.  The ramped up fans move a lot of very warm air, but it's the sound of air moving, and while it's noise, it's not unpleasant or uncomfortable to talk with like many other computer fans I've had.  I give the cooling a good thumbs up, although I was surprised it came on so quickly.***update 2022_08_06***The battery life continues to improve slightly.  2.5 hours of dnd using hero labs, wifi, moderate browsing for rules clarification and minimal sketching burned up about 11% battery life.The machine has been incredibly quiet although I haven't run taxing software yet.  This is all a HUGE improvement over my previous machine where the fan would be constantly on with minimal work and would roar when gaming, when I used to game.I find transitioning between keyboard and note taking/sketching to be an extremely satisfying experience.  I had no idea how much my previous laptop bothered me will all the flaws of the keyboard and touchpad issues I experienced.  I will say the transition can be a little clunky when I'm typing and then need to make a note and then typing again.  I find that I don't like making more than a one-word notation in laptop mode and so I'm switching between both when doing a mixed document.One note handles written text differently than I thought it would.  If you're mixing typed text with written, they act as two separate things.  Hitting enter will move your typed text (if done above) but it won't move what you've written, which will need to be moved separately .  As such, you may want to write to one side, type on the other and then select and combine when done with both to print as a pdf document.***update 2023_08_04***Battery life:  I switched back to 120hz and while the battery is still draining faster, after 4 hours I still have a 55% charge.  Of note, I've been away from my keyboard quite a few times today, but the screen is set to remain on and I also was streaming music for part and there was a lot of internet searching today.  What I am saying is that after all the updates, the battery life for 120hz, while not on par with 60hz, seems greatly improved for basic tasks.  Obviously taxing software will burn through batter life much faster.******What are the key things you should know before buying?Battery Life:The battery life you likely to receive from the unit depends on usage and programs and blah blah blah.  I did a lot of research in this area for real world usage and found that when I change the screen resolution to 60hz, there is a noticeable improvement of the battery life to about 8-10 hours of solid use.  Ten looks like the absolute max.  With the screen at 120hz, I was watching the battery life fall and would guess about 3 to four hours of use.  My usage was browsing, one note, excel, email, and hero labs (a DND character application).  While I have a machine with a video card, I don't tend to game on my laptop, and I haven't played with drafting tools yet.  I have not done long term testing to see if 120hz eventually has an improved battery life after configurations/learnings/updates are all complete.  I switched my machine back to 120hz and it now appears to be draining slower, so maybe?  I would say to plan on my first case scenario, and I'll update if I notice better performance long term.While I can't say Microsoft lies about the battery life, as they provide the ridiculous specs in which they achieve it, I will say that their numbers are misleading based on real world use.Slim Pen 2 and SLS combo:If you're not purchasing this with a pen, you are purchasing the wrong machine.  I believe this machine is specifically for those that need a hybrid work environment.  Drawing concepts in presentations, showing work for math, chemistry, and physics homework, or just sketching design concept ideas.  This machine works well for these things, but all require a pen.  There are cheaper and higher performing machines out there if this is not your need.  Microsoft sells these separately, but they should be purchased together, else, why buy an SLS?There is practically no lag with the slim pen 2!  Lag was my biggest issue with surface and pen technology.  I would not say it is perfect, but when you're looking for rough handwritten notes, this device fits the bill and the slim pen 2 is fantastic.  I won't say it's perfect as zooming in on lines you draw the pen will want to meander, but for real world rough uses, I give it a thumbs up.The magnet to hold the pen is strong and the location is under the touch pad area (to the front, there's a lip on the edge of the device).  Not a perfect connection, but unlikely to be lost when NOT in a bag.  Bags with junk will bump and who knows, so FYI.  It's nice to be out of the way while typing, and available for use.Performance:I can't speak to this.  I don't benchmark, and people can go out there and review that themselves.  I haven't opened up inventor or fusion yet.  I still need to load.  I feel these reviews are all over the internet though, unlike battery and pen usage, so I expect my results will be the same.  I also don't do complex modeling, so my usage in this area would be light and not useful to someone who does it for a living.Note:  This is now a year old and not a powerful computing device.  If performance is a MAJOR concern, you might want to invest in more current machines.  This was not super powerful when it first came out.Keyboard and Pad:The keys click nicely.  May last laptop had very compressed keys (with a T key that started to fail) and this keyboard feels much better.  Key locations feel intuitive.The Keyboard lighting works well and has different brightness options.  I have mine on the lowest.The pad clicks nicely, and I don't accidently bump and click like I did with my other laptop.Windows 11:If you are not used to the operating system, it's a change from windows 10.  I greatly dislike change for the sake of change.  You can read online reviews about the layout.  It's different but I am slowly getting used to it.  I did have to figure out how to navigate and what some of the symbols meant.  You can still pin items to the taskbar, and there are some items you have to change in system and personalization or right click the taskbar and select taskbar settings.After I figured it out, it's fine, but change (grumble grumble)There are also a lot to the system, so poking at the various options to understand how you can tweak your laptop might be good.  But, if you just want it to work, after a slight learning curve it is fine.Stability and set-up:Set-up was pretty easy.  Of note, the power cord has a light on its head opposite to where it connects to the laptop.  This allows you to see if the power is on, if you have a charging issue.  My power strip had been bumped off and I had to google, once I knew there was supposed to be a light and where, it was easy to figure out I had no power and turned the power strip back on.Stability seems mostly good.  No crashes.  The screen orientation changes work but are a bit weird when transitioning.  ""Jumpy"" might be a good way to describe.  Once settled it's all good.The hinge and magnets:This thing is stiff.  A technic to adjust the screen into different positions.  When lying flat I lift the edge closest to me and lift the entire screen fully open, and then I tilt the screen down.  I reverse this when transitioning instead of moving and then trying to transition the screen over the viewing angle I want.  I found this to be much easier and less scrapping.  Otherwise, you're fighting the device, so heads up.The hinge itself seems good.  We will see how it holds up.Quality of build:While parts of the device are metal (screen portion), the base appears to be plastic.  Metal lasts better than plastic, and time will tell how this holds up.  I expect discoloring and scratches on the plastic, and I hope I never drop this.Weight:This is heavier than I thought.  While my last power laptop (incredible fully maxed device that lasted me seven years before the keyboard started dying) was slightly heavier and larger with a 13"" screen, this feels heavier despite being smaller and slightly lighter.  It weighs in at just over 4lbs.  It is smaller and so more dense.  The screen is a great proportion and I feel like there's more viewable space.  My previous laptop had a wide screen, and it wasn't a great use of real-estate for a laptop.Heating:As mentioned, I'm doing everyday tasks and the laptop barely registers as warm on the bottom.  One trend I've noticed with other ""performance"" laptops, is that the containers are too small to appropriately cool the devices and they get incredibly hot (looking specifically at you, Dell, who I will never buy from again).  Already this device is better than a number of other slim ""performance"" laptops I've looked at.What were my primary motivations in purchasing and who might this work well for:People who need to draw to communicate ideas.People who need a long battery life.People who need a portable device that doesn't lag when writing and they need to write.People who hate putting keyboards on the surface of a table or lap because... it just seems wrong.People who need some power, but are okay with a non-top of the line machine.People who are okay spending premium money for a lower spec'd item that fits the above unique needs.Overall?I knocked off a star due to specifications, but the machine works exactly as I hoped, and I am enjoying my interaction with it.  I understand why so many compare it to a mac.  Apple products have a great ""feel"" to them, and this laptop definitely replicates some of that if not all of it.Final note:If you purchase, defintely look up various issues that might be important to you.  I found reviews tended to be very superficial and even biased.  I found that looking up issues (battery life, heating, crashing, etc.) helped me weed out some of the machines I was looking at.  It wasn't that none of the machines had negative reviews, but more the quantity of negative reviews compared to others.  The SLS definitely has had negative reviews, but the amount compared to others I was looking at were significantly less, so I took a leap at the high price tag, and so far I'm happy.I will update as I run into changes and get a feel for the performance of the piece too.  I hope this helped.","Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio - 14.4"" Touchscreen - Intel® Core™ i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Platinum","1,590.00",microsoft
1580,Nuhash Mashud,2022,4,Very good but has flaws and definitely not for everyone,"Now let me preface this by being clear. I am an undergraduate computer science student. My father pretty much gave this computer to me as a gift during Christmas just for something to take notes on. I use the Whiteboard app a lot in fact to be able to take notes on it. I understand that you could type out the notes on a computer or whatever but I prefer using a notebook but at the same time I need to know what I'm writing about and a notebook can only grant me so much space. So this may not be a device for everyone but it is for me at least for the version I got.After two months with this product I could safely say this is a very good product that Microsoft has made. I have used it a little for drawing here and there and it does a fine job and for note-taking it's a great device with a bit of flaws.Goods*The screen is extremely high-quality. The gloss may turn some people off but I think it's great it does get a little dusty but that's easy to clean up.*The mouse pad is great. It reminds me of the MacBook mouse pad but it's much more responsive and smooth.*The keyboard took me time to get used to, especially considering this is the first time I ever used the laptop without any num keys.*The speakers get as loud as I want them to be but audio definitely sounds crisp and extremely high quality.*The way that the device switches from laptop mode to tablet mode is pretty simple for the most part, there is one thing that however concerns me but I'll get to that later I like the little bit of tilt that it has on the upper level because it gives me a better elevation to where I want to write.*The magnets are really helpful and strong when it comes to me putting the pen close to the computer.Bads*The battery life because it runs out very fast whenever I'm using the device like I was in class for 50 minutes one time and it drained very fast. I was at full100% battery and at the end of class it drained to 36%.*No USB ports I know more devices are using the USB C Port right now but the limited amount of the USB option really does bug me personally considering that I still have more devices that uses a standard USB cable over a USB C I understand that I could probably buy an adapter for that or whatever but it would have been nice to have more options for the device rather than just 2 USB C port. I'm not saying they should go all in and include two USB ports on the left and one on the right but at least one would have been nice.*There's no way to lay the screen flat on the table in tablet mode. This is one of the biggest problems because one thing I liked about other surface devices is that they would allow me to position the device anyway I wanted. However with this one you don't get as many options all you get was the flat bit tilted tablet mode and a viewing mode as you could say. This brings me to the biggest problem with the device and this may sound minor to many people but for me it kind of scares me.*The tablet to laptop mode hinges scares me to the point where I think if I bend it enough it's going to break. I'm not sure when it will happen but I will make sure to update people when it does. Because the device looks very sensitive and again it scares me and I usually don't get scared of this type of thing but I am for this one. When I am writing or drawing I exert a lot of pressure on a table surface or notebook that is how I feel comfortable when I write or draw and on this device I get scared every time I do something like that.*It is a little overpriced for it's specs and functionality.  256gb ssd is good but for $1,500 that's too much. Considering that there are laptops with the same functionality and better specs this was a bit expensive for what it is.Overall this is a great device may not be for everyone but it is great non the less for me. It will not automatically replace a tablet for those that have one and may not be the best tool for artist. But considering that there are people that may want a device that has the same functions of a tablet but also be able to use it as a computer this is a very good device for them if they are ok with the pricing. Keep in mind the version that I bought was not ment for gaming I didn't buy it to play video games, so for those that are getting this there is gonna be alot of restrictions when it comes to gaming.","Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio - 14.4"" Touchscreen - Intel® Core™ i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Platinum","1,590.00",microsoft
1581,R. Winningham,2022,4,"Artist or Developer, this is the laptop for you","I’ve had the pleasure of using three different Surface Laptop Studios. They each far exceed my expectations.I currently have one at work and one at home. (I don’t like mixing work and home on the same computer). This means I have one to pamper and one to abuse. I won’t disclose which is which.My background: I’m a senior software engineer for a Fortune 300. I need virtualization, horsepower, and flexibility at work (Visual Studio, Docker, Kubernetes). I’m also a 3D artist at home (Blender, TopoGun, Maya, 3DS, Chitubox, etc.).When I have to, I use Office.My usage patterns are all over the place.First: I was skeptical of the “cloth hinge”. I flipped the hinge over and over for two days. I can safely say, I t’s not gonna wear out quickly.Having used Wacom products for years, I didn’t know what to expect from “the pen”.The Physical Pen Integration is well thought out. It pairs, charges, and stores in a well hidden (and easily accessible) location. The Pen is also well integrated with the latest version of leading artists’ software.From an artist’s standpoint, when you draw on the screen, you’ll probably need an external keyboard. I haven’t tried “the dial”. The “feel” is different from a Cintiq. It’s a bit squishy, but acceptable if you can adapt.Windows Home can be easily upgraded to Enterprise with the appropriate ISO and Product Key.I would prefer a larger amount of available RAM. 32 GB is too little for me. (Apple has 64GB laptops, just sayin’).This is probably “more laptop” than the average user would need. It’s also on the heavy side.The Screen-Flipping-Feature isn’t for everyone. Although, it does more than you’d expect. It allows you to tilt the screen forward (over the keyboard) when using an external keyboard. You can also flip the screen away from you and use the computer as a Hotel Movie Screen.Unfortunately, The Pen isn’t included.Heavier than anything “traditional”Anything but “traditional.”","Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio - 14.4"" Touchscreen - Intel® Core™ i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Platinum","1,590.00",microsoft
1582,NYGarlic,2022,3,Not what I had hoped for,"As I reviewed this, it has been three days since I've received the Laptop Studio.There's been some getting used to and some adjustments that I had to make. So partially this has been with the Laptop Studio or with Windows 11 (since it came installed with Windows 11).For the device, had some problems such as it not charging when I plugged it in. I thought maybe it was my charger's issue (even thought it was working fine the previous evening) so I went and tried another charger - still didn't work. Had to search online, and seems like others experienced the same issue. Had to do a hard restart in order for it to work.Another issue was that the time was two minutes fast. Checked the settings and it said it was not synced since 2015. Was the Studio Laptop even around since 2015? Had to manually change the time but eventually was able to sync the time to auto update.Another issue is when I move a handful of folders from one directory to another. It will move but will leave copies of the folders (empty) in the original location. Freaked me out as I thought something happened to my files.Initially, the screen would flicker. Encountered it a handful of times so I did a google search on a solution. Some people said to open up Nvidia Control Panel but when I did that, NCP would just disappear. Had to google search for a solution there too.My biggest issue with the Laptop Studio is how slow it is. I'm the type of person who has a TON of tabs but still my old Surface Book 2 was able to handle it at 16GB RAM. This device has 32GB RAM and is suffering. I thought maybe it was the Chrome and Opera not optimized for Windows 11 but when I tried to open a folder on my desktop, it struggled too. There's a lag in everything I do.*****Also, Amazon royally screwed up my order. They initially sent me the wrong item; Surface Pro 7. So I wanted to exchange it but they said it's a third party so they cannot exchange. They wanted me to return it and buy it again. NOT as simple as exchanging it but fine. Even when the Surface Pro 7 was delivered back to Amazon, they don't initiate the return. So I contact Amazon to initiate the return, they then initiate the return for the SECOND PURCHASE!

1583,Amazon Customer,2022,5,Great Multi-use Laptop,"As a student looking to convert to a more digital format in terms of notes and schoolwork, this laptop is great! I've had it several months now and I use it with a surface pen to take notes with it as if it was a regular pen-and-paper notebook. The processor and graphics card also allow me to run all of my favorite video games smoothly without any technical difficulties. It is a large computer and is a bit more heavier than I would've preferred, but overall that's something I'm willing to sacrifice to be able to have everything in one place. The only real grudge I have with it is the battery life. If you're not running anything particularly battery consuming (ie. video games) it usually can last a few hours. However, be prepared to watch your battery levels drop when you play even 5 minutes of your favorite PC game.Overall, if you're looking for a tablet-computer that can handle heavy loads and is a bit less pricey compared to it's Apple and Dell counterparts, this computer might just become your next best friend.","Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio - 14.4"" Touchscreen - Intel® Core™ i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Platinum","1,590.00",microsoft

1585,J. Graham,2022,5,Best laptop I’ve ever purchased!,"First of all: I am a tech junky and have bought a dozen, or more, portable computers over the years. I generally end up frustrated with poor screen quality, misrepresented battery stamina, poorly backlit (or not at all) keyboard, poor trackpad, or something else I didn’t know prior to purchase.I bought two. One for my wife, one for me. I chose the 32GB with 11th Gen Intel i7 CPU with independent NVIDIA GE Force 3050 RYX graphics card. This is one absolutely impressive computer after 5-days. Windows 11 takes a little getting used to. It’s not bad, just a little different. Eventually you have to upgrade so we’ll all have to switch at some point.Battery appears to last over 13-hours with screen as bright as it gets. It has zero lag switching apps. It seems much “lighter” than prior OS.It is a little heavy to be truly portable, but you could choose the 13” display instead of the 14.4”. I’m sure the long lasting battery is responsible for the overweight laptop.I will use it “in-dock” 85% of the time running two 35” monitors, multiple data hog financial streaming apps, desktop version of MS Outlook and a ton of browser windows tabs. With the quality and quantity of RAM I suspect it’ll be just fine, but I will update after a while operating that glut of functions.Concluding my rambling review, I love the MS Surface Studio 14.4” w 32GB and 1TB SSD. If I had to say something negative it’d be that the generic dock the claims to work with it does not work in my ZIP code. Pay up for the MS branded dock. Use quality cables and plug strips to get the most out of your Surface.Go ahead and buy yours!

1586,Steven Harder,2022,5,Almost perfect,"I bought the Surface Laptop Studio along with the Acer ConceptD 7 Ezel in order to compare them. The color and contrast on the Acer were obviously much better, and the Slim Pen 2 gets jittery when drawing slowly/carefully. However, the Surface display gets much brighter, and writing/drawing on it feels much more natural, mostly because of the awkward aspect ratio on the Acer and a very noticeable gap between its display and digitizer. I had also anticipated that the three set positions for the screen on the Surface might compare poorly against the Acer's infinitely variable ""Ezel"", but it didn't end up bothering me at all. I tend to use the middle position, where the display sits between the keyboard and touchpad, even when I'm holding it in one arm and using it in portrait mode. For some reason it just works for me.The speakers on the Surface are very impressive. It's quite a bit louder than my MacBook Pro, though not quite as pleasant to watch movies on, since the display has less contrast and the audio isn't as full on the low-end. The Acer's speakers are a complete joke, but all of this is really a side note, since I wouldn't use either device for watching movies and I use studio monitors for audio. Really, my only complaint about the Surface is the stupid, stupid, stupid proprietary ""Surface Connect"" charging/docking port (don't waste your money on the dock, since there is no way to use it without continually charging the laptop and inevitably ruining your battery, ""kiosk mode"" notwithstanding). The fact that the Surface with $400 of accessories still costs $1200 less than the ConceptD certainly doesn't hurt.Ultimately, I returned the Acer and I have no regrets.","Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio - 14.4"" Touchscreen - Intel® Core™ i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Platinum","1,590.00",microsoft

Previously I have a surface laptop 2 for my wife, and it seems not powerful enough to handle the school work she has to design for students. Everything looks vivid on the screen, and the aluminum chassis screams for supreme quality. However, that is not what you have expected. Within the first week, the first unit came up with a vertical green line on the screen. The troubleshooting steps provided by Microsoft are miserable. Ironically, feedbacks from the user communities are surprisingly good. (How the heck a tech giant failed to accomplish an entry level introduction to test their devices?)Amazon pushed us to visit Microsoft for RMA, which costs us $19.99 for shipping even it is their quality issue. I don’t understand why the shipping costs exist in the first place.The second unit seems to be alright after one month use. However, the USB C to display output seems not stable. It could be the issue with the chipset design.Overall, it is a 11th gen intel CPU, but only with 4 cores. If you really consider it as a “studio” machine, you are…….

I use it for some fairly heavy photo/video editing and as my daily/travel laptop. It functions perfectly as my daily work laptop (email, office suite, contracts, budgets, etc.), but has sufficient processing capacity and memory to support my photo/video editing. As a HUGE plus, the fact that this folds flat as a tablet has ensured that I pretty much never use my older iPad anymore as this replaces that device as well for home/couch use. In short, i've been super happy with this device and would recommend it to anyone. I'd also recommend pairing with the new Microsoft Dock 2 as it allows for connecting to all peripherals + multiple monitors. My only beef with the Surface Studio is that it has only  (2) USB 3 ports and (1) audio port (nothing else) which means you need a USB 3 hub for peripherals on the go (including card readers, etc.).

1598,Edimarcos,2021,3,Touchpad is very disappointing,"My unit has weird behavior of the touchpad. When haptic feedback works it sounds like double click. Sometimes after waking up from sleep a very light touch would activate haptic feedback. Only after sometime this issue goes away. Unfortunately, I have to send it back. Too bad that Amazon doesn't provide a replacement :(UPDATE:I checked unit in Best Buy and it has absolutely same sensitivity issue. It doesn't have double clicking sound when I press though. I'd say that initially you going to be satisfied with this product but at some point you'll start noticing some issues such as:- Sometimes pointer would jump back to a previous position when you press touchpad. It looks like a software glitch, but over course of 6 months it wasn't addressed  (you can search on Reddit about other people reporting this issue).- You'll notice sometimes after pulling laptop out from a backpack touchpad becomes very sensitive. You won't be able to figure for a long time what's going on, but eventually you'll find out that putting laptop to sleep and flipping it upside down for 10 seconds reproduces issue. Weird, huh?- Eventually, in tablet mode you'll find out when you press on the screen near one of the edges it moves and slightly hits laptop's base which produces annoying sound. That happens because display is slightly bent in the middle on that side. You'll take a ruler to figure if that's true and you'll find that not only that side is bent/bowed but all sides of display aren't straight. It might be normal though but I'm not sure if it should be this way. I see that other laptops I own have some sort of curvature, but I never noticed it because that laptop do not have touch displays.If you decide to buy this laptop then you should lower your expectations below MacBook Pro (I own 2019). Just put its quality at the level of all other laptops out there cuz it's neither better nor worse.Keyboard is good though :)","Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio - 14.4"" Touchscreen - Intel® Core™ i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Platinum","1,590.00",microsoft
1599,JBSmoove2,2022,1,Perfect for about 20 days.  Then it started to buzz.,"This feels like, and looks like a premium product.  I think that MS is on to something with this design.  However, after about 1/2 a month the thing started buzzing, sizzling, and popping like something out of a roadside diner.  Not certain why, but every power source I tried, only caused a loud whining sound to emit from the computer, and for the amount of money that MS charges for this machine, that's not acceptable.This wasn't the case when I first took it out of the box, but I can't sit in a room with a computer making that sort of noise.  I was worried that the buzzing/sizzling/popping was just the start of a cascading series of failures so back it went.","Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio - 14.4"" Touchscreen - Intel® Core™ i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Platinum","1,590.00",microsoft

1606,Brian Asquith,2022,5,Solid - a great alternative to Surface Pro and improves upon the Surfacebook - pleasure to use.,"I bought the Laptop Studio (SLS) to create digital art on a Windows system with the option to use for std home/work tasks.  I initially bought the Surface Pro 8 but the detachable keyboard and kickstand felt flimsy/awkward - the solidity of the SLS fills the niche between the Pro and the Surfacebook.It's a robust device - solid design, with MS addressing the shortcomings of the Surfacebook (hinge, detachable tablet, top heaviness) with the interesting folding design to turn the SLS ""laptop"" into a ""tablet"".The SCREEN is great, but while on paper the Pro seems to only have a slightly higher resolution, the Pro is noticeably higher in actuality.  The 14.4"" screen offers a lot of real estate, excellent for digital art - note it is also very reflective/glossy.The SLIM PEN is excellent - the haptic feedback gives an improved handling sensation compared with the plastic nib on glass typical of other systems - artists definitely it a try, it might be a gamechanger for you.The SPEAKERS do a great job - mostly listen to EDM, and while the speaker size limits the fullness of the bass, I've listened to music on the SLS for 12+hrs without aural fatigue.KEYBOARD and TRACKPAD both function well - touch typing is well accommodated.Reviews I read prior to purchase were largely written at the time of release, Oct 2021, many complained that the PRICE was too high.  MS has since reduced the price ($1800's for i7, 16GB RAM, 512 GB SSD, NVIDIA GeForce Rx), which somewhat mitigates the complaints.  This SLS configuration is also 4lbs, which isn't light!The one design issue I have is the COOLING VENTS exhaust to the front of the laptop (unlike every other laptop I've used) - it feels weird having hot air blowing over your hands/wrists and the front of the laptop can get quite warm.  Also, the SLS would surely look excellent in black, but currently only platinum is available (maybe as a result of the sliding screen would scratch up the black surface).I've largely used the SLS plugged-in, but from the little use of the battery, it does seem that the battery life is mediocre - brightness and setting to screen refresh 60Hz helps matters.From a week or so of use, it is an enjoyable experience - it has a couple of shortcomings but IMHO it is the best device out there in the Surface line of devices.","Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio - 14.4"" Touchscreen - Intel® Core™ i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Platinum","1,590.00",microsoft

I have a Samsung pro 360 also and the Surface studio blows it away.  I have owned hundreds of laptops from Compaq in the 1980's to Surface laptop 3.  The surface studio is perfect for developers, engineers, artists, and home computing.  Very sturdy, excellent display, very fast, and the perfect size for all modes including tablet mode.  Great for presentations.  I highly recommend the surface studio laptop.  I also own a MacBook Pro 16 and am planning to sell it.

Why does Microsoft charge $7/month to use their software even on their own hardware?Also, the stylus made for this laptop is sold separately and costs another $120.It's unfortunate that they created such a great piece of hardware only to feel like a Chromebook knockoff because they can't include software.

Do you really want to spend $3,000 on a laptop that you can’t attach a USB to without a dongle or Surface docking station? I ended up finding a computer more advanced $1,000 cheaper.

El panel táctil (trackpad) deja un poco que desear en cuanto a tacto y respuesta, lo alterno con un mouse inalámbrico Microsoft.Los aspectos negativos son varios:- El peso: es un ladrillo, excesivamente pesado, no se entiende. No es agradable para viajar, ni para moverlo de sitio.- Se recalienta demasiado, a pesar del diseño de evacuación del calor que tiene, se pone muy caliente al tacto.- El sonido no es nada excepcional, los parlantes están disimulados debajo del teclado y creo que ello disminuye su eficiencia. Existen soluciones mejores en el mercado.- Lo peor: ¡la batería no dura! Microsoft anuncia un día de trabajo, en lo personal se me pone en modo de ""ahorro de batería"" después de unas 5 a 6 horas de uso normal (navegación Internet, mails, Word, Excel, WhatsApp, nada fuera de lo normal).Por el precio que pagué me siento engañado y muy frustrado.

1616,Chris,2021,5,"Unreliable hardware, no international support, slow processor","This is my third Surface device from Microsoft, and I had very, very good luck with SP4 and SP6). And so, I purchased the i7 32GB RAM 2TB option. Having the ability to fold and rotate the screen to portrait mode really helped with certain types of data displays— that was great! That it was equipped with a somewhat dated i7 processor wasn’t a serious performance issue, as having a fast SSD and lots of RAM makes up for the somewhat slower/older i7 CPU that this is equipped with. However, the Surface Studio Laptop just lasted 4 months before the display failed suddenly and completely while on a work trip from the US to the UK. It seems that, while rare, hardware failures can happen with any computer. On a related note, I had a hardware failure with the SP4 when it was fairly new, and that was sorted quickly by Microsoft. And so, I had high hopes for a solution while I was traveling internationally for work.Unfortunately, I found out that these devices are apparently limited to support from the country you bought it from— and so, if you are not working internationally then likely not an issue for you. But if you to travel internationally for work, it may present a problem (even if you purchase the premium Microsoft support/warranty). Apparently, the UK does not support US purchased Microsoft devices (though they were really very polite about it, I was out of luck). And so, I will be borrowing customer’s computers to do demos until I can return to the US to have my nearly-new Surface Laptop Studio replaced with a refurbished one (Microsoft replacements under warranty are often refurbished units).","Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio - 14.4"" Touchscreen - Intel® Core™ i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Platinum","1,590.00",microsoft

1620,Amazon Customer,2021,4,Replaced my laptop and ipad,"I use this as my go to school/work laptop, as well as a drawing display. For both the surface works well, switching between modes is flawless and the pen is very responsive. I got the matte black one, and while i like the color it does chip easily, with light usage there is some chips in the paint but that is to be a expected with matte colors, they just don't hold up as well. I would not recommend getting matte black for a child or if you are a heavy user. Another thing is that the batter doesn’t last long when using the surface continuously even when on battery saver, I'm a student so there are times where i could be using it for hours at a time, pretty much after 4 hours I’ll have to plug it in. Which leads me to the charger itself, the connector is magnet based and not a real port so to speak, so its very weak. If you’re like me and you like to use laptops on the couch or in bed its going to constantly come unplugged from shifting and movement. Its very annoying i wish it was just a normal charging port. The battery and charging port are the main reasons i rate this 4/5 stars, the decision to get matte black was on me so ill take that L, but over all i do like this laptop/tablet. I don’t use this for gaming so I don’t know how it holds up there, but i cant imagine having steam, discord, and whatever other apps open and having it run just as well as a dedicated desktop, this is more of a light work laptop. As i said before i do use this for drawing and for that it does hold up well. I typically have a few chrome tabs open and a large canvas while drawing (5600x6000px 600dpi) and even when i get up to 40 layers i don't experience lag. And unless you’ve got eagle eyes, you wont notice any delay from the pen, unless you’ve got some high stabilization settings. If you’re looking to upgrade your laptop or looking to consolidate your tech, this is a great product. This totally killed my need for my ipad and runs way better than my old 2017 laptop, so much so that i ended up selling both of them.Some notes:- the pen is sold separately but i do recommend getting it if you plan on drawing or using the surface to write notes.- if you plan on getting a keyboard with it I recommend the brydge surface wireless keyboard, the hinges are strong and really make the surface feel like a laptop","Microsoft Surface Pro 7 – 12.3"" Touch-Screen - 10th Gen Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory – 1TB SSD – Platinum","2,300.00",microsoft

1622,Jennifer,2020,5,LOVE this device,"The portability and comfort of the tablet with the functionality of a full-fledged laptop. I bought a Surface 3 several years ago and now... I can't go back. I love these things too much. It comes with me everywhere. If you're wondering why buy a Surface which is twice the price of a laptop, here's why:1. If you read a lot of pdfs or e-books there is no comparison.  Using the pen on pdfs, the ability to jot down notes in word or pictorial form, the ability to create links to other information that can later be clicked on: Unmatched anywhere else  Turn it sideways and it's a full sheet of paper for writing and notetaking  Turn it sideways to read Comic Books! OMG!  I'll be honest, I'm a gamer and this is my gaming buddy. I pull up ESO maps and One Note allows me to mark up the maps I find online to check off what I've accomplished, rearranged, plan, it's incredible2. Versatility  I watch a lot of movies and tv on my advice. It's comfortable, easy to hold, just the right size screen, phenomenal graphics and good sound  As previously stated, I read on my device  I am a student. I Word Process. A LOT  I am an Excel nut. I spreadsheet like a crazy person. I attach a mouse and organize my life.  I spend a ton of time using video conferencing on this thing3. Physical Perfection (OK so it is not as light as your tablet but for what it can do, totally worth the extra weight which isn't that much)  Just the right size screen which is totally touch and pen friendly  Good battery life and easy and fast to charge. Not so happy about the way the charger connects with the longer part of the charger pointing down which makes it super easy to accidentally dislodge the magnet (CON 1)In my opinion, this is the perfect electronic for my lifestyleSo, what's wrong with it?Only one USB port and no place to insert extra storage or portable storage without using your only USB portNo MICRO SD Card slotThe Charger connection is A. Not universal and B. Stupidly located. You'd think Microsoft would have figured out by now that if you use a laptop ON your lap it'll get disconnected due to poor locationBUY THE KEYBOARD! If you want a tablet, buy a tablet, If you want a computer you need a keyboard why doesn't it just come with one?Bottom line is this. If you need something versatile and not specialized, this is your computer. It's worth the money. If you're looking for something to run a specialized program or a gaming computer, this is probably not your computer. It's not the most powerful device on the market but it is by FAR the most versatile. I could not recommend a better device for students. Buy a protective case, throw it in your backpack, purse, tote, car, suitcase, whatever let it become a part of you, you won't regret it.

1626,Anthony,2020,1,Don’t buy the surface pro 7 from amazon,"Well where do i start..... i ended up getting my item and everything was good for about 20mins of use... however after 20mins my screen would freeze for 10-30 secs. I blew it off at first but then it happen 10mins after then it became a often issue. So i ended up going for an exchange. (The worst idea I’ve ever had). I called up amazon and told them my issue and they were quick to get me a replacement so as first i was satisfied until the surface pro 7 came in the next day. I open the box to find out the box it comes in is not only damage but in a renewed box didn’t even come in the same box it should have come in, then i open that to see the surface pro and the screen film wrapped around it was really dirty as if they dropped it in dirt or so and fingerprints all over the machine. So at this point I’m just hoping it works. This one was not charged at all at 15% like it usually is if you were to buy from Microsoft or an apple device would normally be. So i put it on the charger to find out that it not only has screen tear straight down the middle of the screen but a big red dot half the size of the screen was on there as if they drop the surface pro. So at this point i immediately call amazon and i talked to a representative that ended up giving me a hard time about another replacement even though this one was obviously there fault. So i ended up talking to a supervisor that ended up giving me a hard time as well and in the she said to me that they only do a exchange once but as a one time exception they’ll do the exchange to which i responded with i only want to do the exchange if it’s a brand new product that they are giving me not a renewed one and undamaged. To which she agreed that she would make sure it would be done and put in her notes so the wear house  knows. Well the next day came and guess what.... the man that drops it off throws my package at the wall of my house from a big distance he didn’t see me at all so when i raced over the man jumped in his car and quickly drove away knowing what he did. Not only this but when i open the box the surface pro again was in a dirty renewed box, at this point I’m just hoping it still even worked again no power so i plug it in and guess what it works surprisingly after all that. However i Notice something was different with the boot up process so i knew something was wrong i go to the setting of the computer and the version i bought was 8gb of ram i5 model with 128gb of memory the one i receive as a replacement this time was a 4gb version i5 model with 128gb of memory and GUESS WHAT A DIFFERENT GRAPHICS CARD AS WELL. The surface pro 7 i got not only had 4gb of ram which was wrong but a different graphics card as well that comes in a surface pro 5 are you serious.... so i called up customer service again asking for a supervisor yet again..... just wanting a refund the man told me well i see here that you have a couple of exchange for this device already so i told him this story i am telling now and ask him i wonder why i have “a couple of exchanges” to which he said well instead of a refund i can get you a brand new one and told me how he had to make a couple of phone calls to do this for me so i told him this is the last exchange I’ll be getting ill be asking for a refund next like i previously wanted..if the next one comes in the renewed box which that would mean it’s used.. if it’s broken or the wrong model I’m done with trying and I’m done with the surface pro 7. not only was this the worst experience with amazon that I’ve ever had and worst costumer Service but now I’m going to hate the surface pro 7 because of this. I’ll see what i receive next as of 02/23/2020Sorry for the long review but i felt my experience should be shared for others to see.","Microsoft Surface Pro 7 – 12.3"" Touch-Screen - 10th Gen Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory – 1TB SSD – Platinum","2,300.00",microsoft
1627,M. P,2020,4,Great tablet and touch screen computer for travel- limited apps available though,"Great for travelers who need a functional computer that can also serve as a tablet. I got th Surface Pro 7 because I travel for work and will also be starting grad school so I may need to study on the plane or after work in the hotels. I wanted the full functionality of a computer that would allow me to use MS Office programs as well as the functionality of a touch screen, tablet and inking feature to take notes for class. I am just getting accustomed to the inking feature but I can see that it will be a great asset to me during my program and I enjoy the overall portability of the Microsoft Surface Pro 7.  The screen size is just right for me as I don’t like large computers. I have also purchased a wireless keyboard and mouse for when at home to make it even easier to use when typing papers or working on projects. I also purchased a cute flowered skin with white. sage, pink and gray to protect the metal from any nicks or scratches.  I also purchased the silver pen and got a sage green skin to protect it. I like that the pen magnetically attaches to the side of the Surface Pro 7 and that the pen can erase using the eraser on the pen. The only reason I gave it four rather than five stars is that I am finding that not all apps are offered in the Surface Pro that I currently have. The selection seems quite limited and you can’t get apps from iTunes or Google Play as neither service is compatible with Windows. I am most disappointed that Scribd is not offered as I was hoping to be able to read books while in flight. I have read that there is VM Ware apps that may work.

1634,Tom Johnston,2020,5,Great school tablet,"I really like this Surface Pro 7. It is exactly as advertised with one exception. The battery life is nowhere near what is advertised. On battery saving mode, using only Onenote for taking class notes, it lasts about 4 hours. Fortunately it charges up very quickly though. I can't see any way that I would get a full days use out of a full battery charge in any circumstance. In my case that is not very important because I am always around an outlet but if you need a tablet that will last all day away from a power source you will have a problem. The camera is good enough, not as good as the Apple camera, but I don't really use it as a camera anyway. I use mostly the 365 programs and find that it integrates these programs seamlessly. Onenote comes with the tablet and has been an amazing app for my vet school classes.  It saves my many hours of study time. My only issues are with the instability of Onenote. It closes itself down every few minutes and is very frustrating. I'm sure there is a fix for this but I'm also sure that I won't get it from Microsorft as they have a technical support team that is on par with the customer service team at the cable company. I've contacted them 3 times now and my issue is never addressed. I was actually told to contact Amazon since they sold it to me. It seems like after spending a thousand dollars on Microsoft products they would at least provide a bit of tech support.  I'll just have to scour the web for a fix to this I guess. Overall I would recommend this tablet to every student.

1639,Tony,2020,5,The quality I need in a laptop with a few setbacks,"This is my first purchase of a laptop and any surface product. I did my research on the device before purchasing because I'm doing remote learning and an art major so I already knew what I wanted in a laptop and the pro 7 delivered! I bought this laptop as new so I don't know the case for the rest of these reviews but mine came in the box sealed with plastic NEW WITH EVERYTHING WORKING. Screen works perfect as a laptop/tablet and connects well with my hotspot. The only downside is that I paid so much hoping for the sim card or esim option to be there but it wasn't and although the battery still needs improvement I find that if you allow the laptop to rest every hour the battery drains less. I work so I don't have to use it every second but something to keep in mind.Update: Turns out this laptop has a tendancy to freeze a lot, so if your wifi is top tier you should have no worries. When I use public wifi (which I hate doing), im able to load pages etc. When i use my hotspot (not on my phone) it takes 5 minutes just to load a simple search. This wasn't the case when i first got it, and I even increased the gigs on my hotspot just for it to run. Also, portable chargers dont work unless you get the same magnetic charging chord with usb at the end and a portable with 10000mah. Now I give it 4 stars.","Microsoft Surface Pro 7 – 12.3"" Touch-Screen - 10th Gen Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory – 1TB SSD – Platinum","2,300.00",microsoft
1640,Jaime Enrique Lopez,2020,5,It is even better than you expected it to be...,"My previous laptop was a godzilla, 15 inch monitor, weighs like 3 pounds or something (2014 model). I was looking for something that had the horsepower for what I needed, but also the lightness to carry it around. Although battery life isnt, the best, I DON'T MIND!This thing is a beast! Im very happy running programs like tableau, zoom, excel, powerpoint, all at the same time and with various files and this thing doesn't even flinch. The first few hours setting up and downloading all the programs it felt a big sluggish and I was starting to get worried. Once that was done, it started to fly.Yes, the rotating screen isnt as flawless as apple's iPad. That said, I bought this not to look pretty, i bought it to be my tool in battle. Being able to run all the programs that a regular PC can run is the main decision I went for Microsoft Surface.  The only downside is that Microsoft is a bit costly on the accessories front.I recommend this piece of tech to anyone who needs to travel or is on the move.  I'm a relatively big guy and i've had no major problem with the size of the keyboard. I do put it FLAT on tables because my keystrokes tend to be pretty hard and the keyboard is the most (in my opinion) fragile of the accessories.Lastly, the Pen interface is not perfect YET but oh man, as a first timer working with it, it kicks total ass and makes note taking in OneNote a complete positive trip.","Microsoft Surface Pro 7 – 12.3"" Touch-Screen - 10th Gen Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory – 1TB SSD – Platinum","2,300.00",microsoft
1641,Katie,2020,4,An almost perfect device,"I love this thing! I'm primarily using it as a writing tablet and e-reader for part-time grad school, and I'd like to start using it for work (engineer). It's improved my workflow a ton. The Surface Pen is great and the magnet makes for a very secure attachment. I considered the Surface Pro X, because it has an option for stowing the slim pen in its keyboard but opted for the regular surface pen after trying them out in a retail store.I've deducted one star because:The large bezel. Doesn't bother me much at all, but it really doesn't stack up to competitor designs in 2019/2020. Still looks very sleek overall.Windows 10 works surprisingly well in tablet mode, but Microsoft is really missing an opportunity by not having a good built-in or Office e-reader (epub, pdf, mobi support) with pen support for document/ebook markup. Edge doesn't cut it feature-wise. Luckily there's a popular app in the Microsoft Store called Drawboard PDF that works really well. The lack of Microsoft application support for critical Surface features is another reason for deducting a star! OneNote and other apps were great on here. I'd love to try an MS designed e-reader with pen support.","Microsoft Surface Pro 7 – 12.3"" Touch-Screen - 10th Gen Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory – 1TB SSD – Platinum","2,300.00",microsoft

The packaging & shipping is well done. The device shipped within the expected time frame.As for the device itself, I found the screen size  of 12.3 inches to be a little bit on the bigger side for a tablet mode but is perfect for laptop use. the screen colors are vibrant and supports touch. Windows Hello lets you sign into your account via face recognition, I find it to be more convenient than writing the password to login. I got the I5 8GB version and the windows 10 experience is very smooth for browsing the web, using Microsoft office and other productivity work. I believe for the average person there is no need to buy a higher specs, I5 can get the job done.Surface pro 7 experience is not complete without the Type cover keyboard and Surface pen. Both are a must if you want get the best out of the device and they are worth their price tags.I want to highlight that though this device is a 2-In-1, it is a significantly better laptop than a tablet.

1647,Alfredo,2019,5,i5 10th gen /8gb RAM  / 128GB,"I initially bought a Surface Go(8gb) for a gift and when I had it in my hands I fell in love with the Surface. I had to get one for myself. Since I didn't find another 8gb surface go model, I went w/ the Pro 7 i5/8gb model myself. I am in love with this device. Watching netflix is great,  Illustrator and other drawing software works great w/ the surface pen. Keyboard took a few minutes to get the hang of it and I quite enjoy it, it works well. It is a bit heavy when holding it w/ one hand (this is why I loved the Surface GO version for normal tablet use) but it is quite light overall.Also tested a few games and it actually surprised me a bit tacking into account this is the i5 model. I am able to play Halo Reach just fine, (note that I had to lower the resolution down to 1080p) and it plays good. Minecraft plays really well. I didnt actually get this for gaming ( lol ) but it plays light games just great (of course it gets warm w/ Reach). StardewValley FTW! Currently this is my primary device and it performs extremely well. If you have the extra cash, do go for the i7 model mainly for the 16gb of RAM. OS consumes around 2.5-3GB of ram, so that doesnt leave much left on the 8GB model.

So less compromises on the applications you may need to run. Latest i7 plus a decently fast SSD makes this a good portable workhorse.

1659,Edwin C,2020,5,The complete package Windows Ultrabook. This should be the de facto Macbook alternative!,"If you don't want a MacBook Air/Pro because of macOS, or other Windows manufacturers such as Dell/HP/Lenovo have let you down in the past, the Surface Laptop 3 (i7 1065G7, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD, Matte Black) is quite the option. In my opinion it's the best premium Ultrabook on the market, especially impressive as Microsoft has only been at it for about 3 years.As performance between 85% of Ultrabooks is relatively similar, build and design is a big deciding factor to me, and the Surface won out against worthy competitors such as the Dell XPS 13 (9300), HP Spectre x360 13, and Razer Blade Stealth. A lot of Microsoft + Intel intangibles like Instant On, smart backlighting, and adaptive brightness help this feel like a polished machine that's been innovated for over 10+ years like the XPS lineup.The display on the Surface is excellent. The resolution is higher than standard full HD (not quite QHD because of the 3:2 aspect ratio), and doesn't sacrifice on either battery life (4K Ultrabooks make no sense) or picture quality. Apple and Microsoft seem to be the only ones who believe in making QHD+ displays for 13-14"" instead of 4K. It just makes more sense for everyone.Performance is great for a 15W laptop, although I don't need much horsepower from my laptop as I have other desktops for heavy workloads. It's good in short bursts, and at lasting long. The quad core i7-1065G7 has the highest level graphics config for Intel's Ice Lake processors, so this is as good as it gets for this generation. I would recommend 95% of buyers to just buy the 8GB RAM models, as you'll find more use in just having 4 cores than 16GB RAM.Battery life is good, not amazing. I get about 6-7 hours of active use out of a full charge. It can top up pretty fast while in sleep mode with the included Surface Connect charger. Coming from a device that gave me 2 hours max off of battery, I'm not asking for much. There is some endurance left to be desired, but it's enough for what I need.The touchpad and keyboard are amazing. They're both among the best that Windows Ultrabooks have to offer (although that's not saying much..)Some minor gripes/annoyances:-Intel's Bluetooth and Wi-Fi drivers seem to mess with reception on this device. My range with my Bluetooth headphones is unexpectedly shorter than usual. When waking the device from sleep, Wi-Fi takes a long time to reconnect properly; I sometimes have to restart the machine to get online.- I knew that ordering a matte black metal device would be a challenge to keep clean, but yeah.. pretty hurts doesn't it?Overall, I think this should be the default recommendation for a Windows Ultrabook. at $1299 for the i5, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD, value isn't the best but you have what is the best looking Ultrabook on the market other than the new XPS 13.","Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 – 13.5"" Touch-Screen – Intel Core i7 – 16GB Memory - 256GB Solid State Drive – Sandstone","1,149.00",microsoft
1660,Earnest Borg 9,2021,5,"Powerful computer in a small, lightweight package. (Music Production/Graphics Processing)","I purchased this machine because I recently purchased several Native Instruments plugins for use with my application copy of Fruity Loops. My old computer was struggling to even eek out a full measure without crackling or stuttering, so it was time.This computer is simultaneously running FLStudio with multiple heavy Native Instrument channels without any stutter. I will say that it initially did have a little lag, but upping the buffer threshold has taken care of it. I have seen some complain that the I7 processor is insufficient for heavy music production, but if you are concerned about that, look up a tutorial about turning off the turbo boost since this should rectify the problem that many described.As for graphics, I have been using Flowscape to create ambient animated scenes, and the processor deals with this as well as most high end laptops would. I had a scene with thousands of animated 3d models (plants and particle effects included), and the framerate hovered around 8-10, which is fine for the initial setup of the scene. When I rendered it, it output about 1 frame per second at 4k quality, and the end result was as smooth as butter.Beyond that, it is a good quality, metal body, extremely high resolution machine with a lot of power for only weighing 2 pounds. If you are producing music with 30 different instruments or if you are a professional animator or heavy gamer, then you probably already know that you should spring for a tower with adequate cooling and hardware. If you enjoy moderate/heavy mixing and casual graphics work, this machine is absolutely perfect.The only warning I have is that this does not come with an SD slot. If you are worried about storage space, spring for the model with a bigger hard drive.","Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 – 13.5"" Touch-Screen – Intel Core i7 – 16GB Memory - 256GB Solid State Drive – Sandstone","1,149.00",microsoft
1661,Cali,2020,4,"Tad expensive, but worth it so far.","Bought this as my previous laptop decided to die before my last semester of nursing school. When I was looking into buying laptops, I did a lot of research and was leaning towards a MacBook Pro but couldn’t justify the cost for what the hardware would be offering. Plus limited gaming ability and while I’m familiar with how a Mac operates, I’m most comfortable with windows.This laptop has been awesome, mostly. The look of it is sleek, it handles all my programs for school with ease (which is impressive because the software for taking my exams should be considered a virus at best). The laptop has a great speed, touch pad is sensitive and responsive, and the battery life gets me through the entire day.What’s not so great about it? A couple times I’ll have left the laptop open and go to wake the computer up and it doesn’t respond. Annoying but if I closed the screen and reopen it, it would be fine. One time the laptop was off and wouldn’t turn on, simple google on the phone and already had a fix for it. Also had to turn off the auto adjust for the screen brightness as it was overly sensitive and would constantly fluctuate.All in all, I’m happy with my purchase. There are some things I’d like to be fixed, but I wasn’t willing to spend the money for an even more expensive laptop so I feel like while it is on the costly side, it’s a huge upgrade from what I had and it’s held up great for the past 3 months.","Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 – 13.5"" Touch-Screen – Intel Core i7 – 16GB Memory - 256GB Solid State Drive – Sandstone","1,149.00",microsoft
1662,Jon Gilbert,2021,2,"I probably would not buy this again, for a few different reasons","I probably would not buy this again, for a few different reasons.First let's talk about the magsafe-esque power cord. It's not easy to know if it's actually plugged in: it'll snap to the housing if it's close, but that doesn't mean that it's snapped *into* the port. The light indicating the cable is attached in on the side, so if you're looking down at it you can't tell if it's lit. The power supply is a brick with square, sharp bevels, and I'm left wondering with the low power draw why an existing USB-C port wasn't used.The trackpad is mostly unusable. It's large, which I thought would be great, but that means that while typing minor brushes against it with the meat of my thumb and palm move or re-orient the cursor. Thought you were in this window typing? Nope, now you're over there and half your password is in a slack channel. The Windows 10 setting for ""disable trackpad while typing"" doesn't do that reliably enough to keep it from happening. And, sometimes two-finger scrolling just doesn't work: it'll be fine for hours, then noooope: you are gonna have to drag the cursor over to the scrollbar in the window for about 10 minutes. The trackpad needs to be disabled and an external mouse needs to be used.On the topic of an external mouse: there goes the single USB-A port.When we talk about the bevel, it's impossible to know where the ports along the left-hand side are without lifting the laptop and looking: a small indented dimple or a sticker would go very far towards knowing where to plug in my earphones.Battery life, weight, screen brightness are all relatively par, there's nothing to exclaim or dismiss there. It is a very thin device, but one that still needs an unshapely brick if you want to do anything. It's not a *terrible* device, but it really doesn't do much to make itself *good*, and all the minor and obnoxious annoyances about it add up to a device that you probably don't want.","Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 – 13.5"" Touch-Screen – Intel Core i7 – 16GB Memory - 256GB Solid State Drive – Sandstone","1,149.00",microsoft

In general, its technical performance has been very good (better I would say than the many MacBook Airs I owned before). It handles many large applications and browser windows being open at once.I have come to appreciate the textured surface around the keyboard. It has worn well, despite my concerns when I bought it.The biggest weakness, and it's a big one, is battery life. I'm lucky to get 3-4 hours on any charge, which keeps me plugged in most the time. This is not truly a portable machine.At this point, I'm also concerned about the durability of the case -- just realized that two of the rubber feet on which the laptop sits have broken off, so now it doesn't sit evenly.

Unlike traditional laptops, you can't tilt the screen forward, which makes for awkward angles when video chatting or watching movies, etc. I decided to go with Surface Laptop and I won't be going back!

It is inconceivable that the computer would last one year and MS suggested I buy an extended warranty next time.  I suggested they build a better machine that is dependable.  I also put up with the clunky docking station that sometimes worked and sometimes did not.I am getting the refurbished machine but have every expectation that it won't last the year.

1725,Kurt K.,2020,2,"Compact, Quick, User Friendly, Great Display","I am new to Microsoft laptops. My old HP laptop fell onto the floor one too many times and broke apart so I needed a new laptop. I own and operate two small business, one of them is photography. I needed something that would allow me to smoothly import, edit, and export a large volume of photos. I do quite a few emails and invoicing for both businesses so I needed something quick and reliable. I was drawn to this laptop after doing extensive research on a bunch of laptops for about a week. I liked the build of it but also what it was capable of. It's important to have a high quality screen when editing photos and this laptop does not disappoint at all. The screen is beautiful.I'm a big fan of buying refurbished so that did not worry me at all. However this was my first time buying a refurbished laptop, and from Amazon at that. The laptop arrived in mint condition. It was basically brand new. I wouldn't have had a clue it had ever been used before. I've had it for almost a week now and have had no issues. I've sent email, edited photos, video called, and printed photos from it. It runs smoothly and very quickly. I also enjoy the touch screen option. All in all I am very happy with this laptop and I would recommend it. I will update this review if anything should happen.I did dock a star because the lack of CD drive and SD card slot.",Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 Touchscreen Intel i5-1035G7 8GB RAM 128GB SSD Win 10 (Renewed),435.99,microsoft

1727,Knightman,2020,4,Make sure you are okay with the compromises,"I am pleasantly surprised as I really like the surface laptop Go. I feel like Microsoft missed a home run here with the base model having 4 gb of ram and no fingerprint sensor and then having to go to the next trim at $699 to get the 8 gb ram and fingerprint sensor.  Result: ground rule double.Likes:Design:  it is a nice looking device that stands out from the others in its category. The ice blue is attractive while not the most obvious blue still retains a nice look. The plastic underside does not detract from this either.Size:  It is compact and fairly light.Screen: Despite the sub 1080p resolution, the screen is still attractive and bright with accurate colors.  The 3:2 aspect ratio also makes this a hit because the screen is taller and easier to review documents, because you have to scroll less than a 16:9 aspect ratio.Color options: there are 3 different color options to choose from, options are always good.Ports:  having usb-c and a is great as well as having the device charge from USB-c along with the mag connector for charging.Trackpad:  this is on the nicest trackpads I have ever used as my fingers glide across it.  Mouse movement is great.Price: the base model starts at $550.Fingerprint reader: nice and fast logonPerformance:  all models have an i5 processor and I think this is more than fine for everyday users, even the base model will give you good performance.Neutral:Keyboard: it is okay to type on for me and not as good as the pixelbook go keyboard because it has a somewhat mushy feeling when typing.Screen: it is nice but still it is under 1080p for a device that cost $550 and up. When was the last time you found a device that was not full hd for $500 or up?Sound: I think it sounds decent, not amazing, not a pro or con.Base Model: 4 gb really microsoft you could not have just put an extra 4 gigs in and charge $599.  Why limit it this way? Also no fingerprint reader in base model as well.Battery life: it is in the 7-8 hours territory.  Not amazing but not awful either.Cons:Keyboard: no backlight.  This is the biggest con again when is the last time you had a device over $500 with no backlit keyboard.  It makes typing in poorly lit rooms more difficult and a no fly zone for those who work in darkness.Price:  on the highest tier model Microsoft is really trying to upcharge you just for added storage.$899 just highlights this device's shortcomings even more in that price bracket.Wrap up:  I looked over a bunch of devices in this class and some not in its class.  This is not the quintessential device for me but it is very good.  My biggest gripe is the lack of backlit keyboard on a device in this price range.  I find the screen is very nice looking but the sub 1080p comes across as tacky also.  I feel they could have popped an i3 in the base model and then added the fingerprint sensor.  Avoid the $899 model as that is too much to pay for something so compromised.Also consider:  The Surface laptop 3 is something to consider if you are worried about the compromises being made. It has a backlit keyboard, a full HD+ display and is larger at 13.5 screen display.  It does cost more, and also the bezel around the display is larger.","Microsoft Surface Laptop Go - 12.4"" Touchscreen - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - 256GB SSD - Platinum",629.00,microsoft
1728,A. Newman,2022,5,Fantastic little laptop,"This is everything I'd hoped for in an ultraportable laptop. Super lightweight, easy to carry around, small enough to fit into a day bag, but still decently powerful. Having an SSD vs eMMC for storage and an i5 for a processor makes this feel much snappier than other similar laptops in this class. This also runs Linux almost perfectly, except for the fingerprint reader. My only gripe is the screen is a little dark when using this outside, but it's not unusable.

The charger is similar to Apple's chargers in the sense that you can put in in any direction and it should still charge. Well, my charger right out of the box was already problematic and I had to angle it just right to get my laptop to charge.  Fast forward to last night and my charger just stops working.

1734,deljacla,2021,1,"Some good, some bad.","Edit to original review: This laptop is absolutely horrible. I have not used it for barely ANYTHING because the processor is horrible. I used it to make projects with my printer and cutting machine. The bluetooth disconnects and ruins materials. It literally takes 3 hours to print and cut one sticker sheet because the computer freezes CONSTANTLY. I have zero problems using a different computer for these tasks. The touchpad is also so sensitive that you can’t even use it. You basically HAVE to buy a separate mouse. I hate this laptop and I am NEVER buying another computer from Microsoft. I was prompted to update the OS, and I did and now I can not even start using the computer because I get a MILLION Microsoft ads! How many times must I close Bing windows about Black Friday?!?! This is insanely obnoxious. Every time I change the default browser from Bing to something that doesn’t suck, it changes it back to Bing and I also get a million pop ups about more Microsoft products that I don’t want! It gives me pop ups constantly about emails I never set up ! Do NOT waste your money. This laptop has done nothing but waste TONS of time, money, and my last ounce of patience. I am literally going to smash it with a sledgehammer. Today.Original:  I needed a much better laptop. Initially I was looking for a 2-in-1 (tablet and laptop). I watched some videos and narrowed my selections down. So I knew what to expect going in. Other reviews mentioned how the keyboard is not backlit. I thought this wouldn’t bother me much but now that I have it, it’s pretty annoying, especially because it is a common complaint and surely it is an easy fix, right? This was the cheapest of the 4 new computers I was looking at, and this was $850 with my selection. I probably should have spent a little more I guess. Then I realize that the screen does not detach like the Microsoft Surface Pro 7. Grrr. The screen doesn’t even fold back flat and you can’t use the Surface Pro pen on the screen either!! Gee, must be really good otherwise, right? Not so much. Comes with a ton of bloatware. If you want to use apps you probably use everyday, you have to disable safety mode, or only use Microsoft apps and nobody does that. I do like the aesthetic of the laptop, and the keyboard actually reminds me of my MacBook which has an ancient OS now. The touchpad is great, and so is the keyboard other than no backlighting. It turns on fast! However, this kind of freaked me out: The second time I turned it on, the laptop wasn’t facing me and I already used my finger to unlock it (I thought) but it didn’t work until I got in front of the computer. It made me wonder if it was using my face to unlock like my MacBook. Then it immediately said I was logged into a videoconferencing app that I have never used. I didn’t even realize that app was on this computer and I never created an account for it. I guess Microsoft does what it wants. I removed that app and many more. That was all a big turn off for me. But honestly the biggest complaint is the horrible graphics. My eyesight is not as great as it once was but honestly, the pixelation is bad and noticeable. I installed a photo editing app and even when blowing high resolution images up to edit, it looks worse than really cheap laptops I had 20 years ago. No exaggeration. I have tested this with hundreds of images now. Believe the reviews that mention this! My husband can’t stand when I watch TV on standard definition and that has never bothered me but this screen just looks distorted. I do like that it is small and lightweight. I can slip it in my nightstand and jump on it quickly for quick work stuff and that is great. But I am underwhelmed. Just really consider what the majority of reviewers complain about. If you’re considering any of the Microsoft Surface computers, other models have more to offer.","Microsoft Surface Laptop Go - 12.4"" Touchscreen - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - 256GB SSD - Platinum",629.00,microsoft
1735,Andrea J,2021,4,Easy to use,"I'm giving this four stars for everything because I'm not computer-savvy and there may be issues which I haven't encountered or they don't bother me.  The laptop arrived quickly and I was able to get it going without too much trouble (again, because of me and not the machine). The only thing I don't like is having to  'Sign In' all the time but I'll look up how to resolve that.  The keys feel nice; they are not backlit, but I have a little bendable USB plug-in light which illuminates the keyboard but not the entire room.  I'm very happy with my purchase, and it's a nice color, too.  Not too pink.","Microsoft Surface Laptop Go - 12.4"" Touchscreen - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - 256GB SSD - Platinum",629.00,microsoft
1736,Lydia,2020,4,Solid Basic Laptop,"I purchased this for work, I originally had the Surface Pro 4 tablet. My work consists of lots of emails, designing marketing promotions and ads in Canva, Microsoft Office (powerpoint, excel and word). So nothing too crazy. I will say when I was moving files over, side by side there is a difference in picture quality. The Surface Pro 4 tablet has a very sharp picture. The Laptop Go is a little fuzzier. I can get used to it and for the price, this is a great laptop (the tablet was about $1,000+). I can feel my eyes straining a little bit to read which may not be great in the long run, so I would say if you're not using this for 40 hours a week you'd be fine. If you are, I recommend either getting a different laptop or upping the font to help eye strain.In regards to the seller, they are awesome. I got the computer quickly. I reached out to them to ask about the resolution and they were quick to respond, and asked that I go to Microsoft to discuss.

1737,Wayne,2021,5,Go for the 8 Ram or more,I love this little guy. I first purchased the Apple Air and after using it for a week I just didn't like it. Don't get me wrong the Apple Air had a great battery life and key board. I just am so use to windows that some Apple programs I found harder to use. This 8 ram Surface go so far has been doing very well for my needs. It price is a few $100 less then the Apple and it seems just as quiet as the Air. The screen is pretty good not as good as the air but if you don't have them side by side you won't know the difference. I did find a clear plastic cover to fit over my Surface go on Ebay. The cover I got for the Apple Air was easer to find then the one for the Go. All in all so far this laptop seems well built and I'm very happy with how well it works and how well it's built. I love the color  sandstone it's very close to the Apple Gold. Good pick for the money! Seems to be very little fan sound.

1743,Lynne S,2021,5,Love my new computer.,"It's a fine, standard laptop for 2020 that isn't expensive. In my opinion, WAY better than Asus Chromebooks. I'm a teacher who has to teach virtually during lockdown, so I'm streaming audio and video all day long. I have to say -- for a relatively inexpensive laptop, it handles the streaming well. It does get overwhelmed and slow down when I'm in 2 or more Google Classrooms simultaneously and have open multiple windows and 20+ tabs, but I don't think the laptop is to blame, more the crazy demands of virtual teaching. The camera is a huge upgrade from my 2011 Asus laptop. WARNING: there's only 1 usb port, so that Anker multi-port plug-in is a MUST. But it's very cheap compared to what Best Buy tried to sell me ($15 vs. $90!!) and works flawlessly.

1761,A Jones,2020,1,Faulty Laptop - Thin Blue vertical line on screen that cant be removed,"Buying this laptop was a bad mistake. I bought it in Jan and did not open it until late Feb / early march, I now realise that not opening it and checking the computer as soon as I received it was a huge mistake. When I did open it about 4 weeks later I realised it was faulty and now I'm stuck with the laptop as the refund option has disappeared from my Amazon purchase history.Upon turning on the laptop I noticed a thin blue vertical line on the left of the screen. I tried to find a solution on Google only to discover that the likely culprit is a hardware issue either with the display or graphics card. Today I logged into my Amazon account only to realise that the ""return/refund"" button is no longer there, so I am stuck with a new laptop that has a blue line down the screen. I tried to do a screen capture to show the blue line but the line does not appear in the screen capture, so this to me indicates that its the LED itself which is faulty. I have never heard of or seen this before. I decided to take some picture with my phone, here you will see the line, it looks black in the photos but its actually blue.Amazon or seller please help as I need this laptop replaced or refunded.","Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 – 15"" Touch-Screen – AMD Ryzen 7 Surface Edition - 16GB Memory - 512GB Solid State Drive – Matte Black","1,599.00",microsoft

1767,Steph,2022,5,Worth every penny!,"After spending alot of time researching many different chromebooks, tablets and laptops in the $200-500 that would best suit my needs I found myself getting frustrated and overwhelmed by the process and was about 30 seconds from giving up and settling on one that was not ideal just to get the process over with. That is when this beauty miraculously appeared! Not only did it check 9 out of 10 of the boxes I needed it to, it was also 1/2 the price compared to others I researched in this category.  I love the design and versatility of having a laptop and tablet in one option.  I also like that unlike some of the other 2 in 1 chromebooks it is not flimsy and they clearly took into consideration the lifestyle needs of a 2 in 1 chromebook keeping it lightweight yet very sturdy. The battery life is wonderful, it charges quickly and a full charged has lasted me over a full day at work as I used it continuously for a total of 10.45hrs before it got down to the red at 15%. And that was without turning on the battery saver option! The display is clean, crisp & vivid. Whether it's used for streaming a movie or creating a new document, you will be satisfied with the visuals for sure. Set up was a breeze as was learning the ins and outs of all this chromebook offers. The only ""complaint"" I have in regards to this specific model is the lack of protective cases designed to fit it. I understand this is not a issue about the product itself but I did want to make people aware of it as there is only 1 brand of hard cover cases that fit it and do not have to be removed for use(mCover hard shell case for 12.2in Samsung v2 chromebook).I highly recommend also using a padded waterproof shock absorbent carry case as well for travel, as the hard case is mainly to protect from scratches and dings and WILL NOT protect it in the event it is dropped, banged or similar.  The other recommendation is a 9H screen protector, especially if you plan to use the touch screen and stylist pen options. If I could give it 10stars I would.

1772,Person,2020,4,"Awesome battery life, heavier than expected, pen is fine","I like this computer.I received it yesterday and spent the entire evening getting used to it. The laptop comes with a stylus, and a power cable. I think it's made of plastic but it feels pretty solid, and it's way heavier than I expected. I fear I may drop it because of it's weight. Out of the box it has no power, you must plug it in to the wall with your provided cable.Some issues are that there is one dead pixel that has been present ever since I turned on the device. I don't really care for it as it's so tiny, but I know that some may not be okay with it for it appears to be an irremovable speck of dirt. Another issue is that the stylus has a bit of delay. Another is that the scrolling is a bit wonky in Android apps, I can not use two fingers on the mouse pad to scroll in the Discord app for example, but I can use the pen/my finger to operate it from the screen as I would on my phone. This makes sense since it is an Android app after all, but it'd be nice to not have to switch back and forth from laptop to pen abilities. The app drawer is only properly functionable when using the pen or your finger.I fell asleep with it the laptop on, and woke several hours later. My battery did not empty in my absence of activity, and none of my progress was lost. Though it did not lock my screen, but I am pretty sure I can fix that in the settings. I am just amazed that it did not die and nothing was lost even though I left it for several hours. The laptop is also extremely quiet I now realize, I have not heard a single mechanical noise coming from it and I am typing this from a silent room.Also, Chrome OS isn't that bad, I had planned to attempt to download Ubuntu on it, I am still going to get it to have more useful software available, but I will also use Chrome OS since it's not as bad as I thought it would be.Overall the computer is pretty epic","Samsung Chromebook Plus V2, 2-in-1, 4GB RAM, 32GB eMMC, 13MP Camera, Chrome OS, 12.2"", 16:10 Aspect Ratio, Light Titan (XE520QAB-K01US)",299,samsung
1773,David Edwards,2019,5,"It's more like ""2/3 laptop, 1/3 tablet"" rather than a 2-in-1.","I've been in the market for a cheap laptop for work for a while.  I have a hefty gaming PC at home but I wanted something completely separate and portable for non-gaming needs like using the internet and word processing.  Additionally I've been trying to read more and sometimes this leads to me using the Kindle app on my phone.  I was drawn to the Chromebook Plus (V2) because of the attempts to make it more like a tablet and utilize Android apps.Overall the product works exactly as described.  The screen is good, though the default settings make the things like the app shelf, window borders, and pointer size a little too large in comparison to the parts of the screen in use.  This is variable once you poke around the settings, though, and I have no complaints.  The keyboard is fantastic and responsive.  The touchscreen is pretty good, though it's not quite on par with the perfection that is an iPad touch screen.  Sometimes I miss when I try to click on things with my finger or perhaps it doesn't register at all.  That happens so infrequently that it's still entirely usable.  The pen is also nice, though I've only used it so far to doodle in the Google Keep notes app as it was not a main selling point for me.  The battery life is about on par with what is advertised; I used it lightly from 7:30-2:30 yesterday, for example, and it only got to about 50%.  The foldability for tent and tablet mode is a little bit awkward considering the size and the fact that the keyboard is always attached, but it works.  It just makes me prefer it as a laptop more than a tablet most of the time.The performance is acceptable considering the hardware.  With my other machine having a much more powerful processor and more RAM, I actually do notice a bit of delay in navigation online and when using multiple apps.  With that said, it's not bad at all, and the comparison is actually rather unfair.My main complaint is really only the quality of the touchpad for using the cursor.  It works well, but it's a little bit choppy and doesn't respond to light and subtle movements when trying to be precise.  Again, this might be unfair because the only recent laptops I've used have been MacBooks and those touchpads are incredibly smooth, but it's still worth pointing out.Overall I'm highly satisfied with my purchase.  The problems I've described really aren't even problems but rather little quirks that I've already gotten used to.  It works for everything you'd want a Chromebook to work for and it does it well.","Samsung Chromebook Plus V2, 2-in-1, 4GB RAM, 32GB eMMC, 13MP Camera, Chrome OS, 12.2"", 16:10 Aspect Ratio, Light Titan (XE520QAB-K01US)",299,samsung

1778,Ian B,2018,3,Decent convertible with tradeoffs,"This is a decent hybrid and good for basic browser/tablet tasks. If you try to do much more with it, you might be disappointed. I'm ok with the $350 Black Friday price, but would be disappointed if I spent $500 on this, so giving it 3 stars instead of 4. Paying $600 for the m3 processor would be too much for this class of device, especially with only 4gb ram. It does fine for browsing, but Android apps can be kind of glitchy.  Touch responsiveness can be spotty in tablet mode. This might be ChromeOS' fault, but it's an advertised feature and should be expected to work. Using a 2k external monitor over usb-c works, but is choppy. I'm guessing this is a combination of the low ram and integrated graphics (cpu usage wasn't high). I wouldn't do it regularly. I like that is has 2 usb-c ports, but putting them both on the same side is annoying. The screen half is much heavier than other laptops I've used and makes it hard to balance on your lap. The camera on the body is pointless unless you plan to take photos in tablet mode (don't be that person). The keyboard is fine, but the touchpad is a little cramped. This just comes with the territory on this size device.Basically it does a lot of things adequately and not much more. If you're ok with that, you might like it. For the price, you could get a much better tablet or laptop, but this gives you a little of both.Pros:- USB-C- Screen- Stylus- Size- Build qualityCons:- Speed/responsiveness- Weight (top-heavy screen)- Thickness- Price","Samsung Chromebook Plus V2, 2-in-1, 4GB RAM, 32GB eMMC, 13MP Camera, Chrome OS, 12.2"", 16:10 Aspect Ratio, Light Titan (XE520QAB-K01US)",299,samsung

I bought the Chromebook to use when traveling extensively in the US and Canada, so I need wi-fi on the device at all times. If you buy the Chromebook from Verizon, it comes with the chip installed. So I ended up paying quite a bit more than I was hoping for given the fact that I initially got a good deal on Amazon. It's not recommended that you use your cellular phone as a wi-fi hot spot for the Chromebook. And I don't have a smart phone anyway, so that was not an option for me.

1785,Dsol303,2021,1,Not worth the hype. Glitchy and heavy,"I was really excited to try a Chromebook and searched around through many of them before choosing this one. I wanted it for my travels as something smaller that could fit in my purse or bag. Unfortunately during my trip there were many times when I would try to turn it on and it just would not turn on. Or it would be frozen up. And it was brand new. The battery life lasts a long time but what's the point when I can't get it to even turn on or open a program. And although the size was right, or I thought it was, it is actually very heavy for its size. The weight of it in my purse actually made my shoulders hurt where my purse strap was. It's quite hefty. It doesn't seem like it for the first few minutes but as you continue on with it you can really feel its weight. At this size I feel like it's kind of pointless. It's not small enough to easily fit in a purse or small bag, and definitely not light enough. But it's also too small to be a decent laptop for home. Unfortunately by the time I got back from my trip, only having used it a couple times, the return window had closed and so I'm not able to return it. So now I'm stuck with this. If the seller could contact me so I can return this it would be great.","Samsung Chromebook Plus V2, 2-in-1, 4GB RAM, 32GB eMMC, 13MP Camera, Chrome OS, 12.2"", 16:10 Aspect Ratio, Light Titan (XE520QAB-K01US)",299,samsung

Obviously the settings had been restored to their original format but there are no scratches, dents, dings, or any tell tale signs of use to be seen.

Not just getting norked out of your two hundred smackers and your valuable time. Right? Not just serving to provide a connection to someone who lacks a valid visa, Right? Now's the time to dish the real dirt on the first purchase: it burned my legs, there was some bad circuitry or programming. This device is labeled as made in VietNam but I wouldn't be sure it's even that good. The price is cheap and the build is like from Mattel but this is no toy. Buyer Beware!!!The replacement seemed new enough & didn't burn my legs or fingers but I had to return it. Along with the bargain chromebook came some dedicated representatives of the seller/manufacturer...? Who set up camp across the creek from my cabin & have been diggling with the connections for weeks. Its been a total hassle. Still I wanted to avoid the bother of returning a $200 dollar purchase & tried & tried to make it work but just like the first purchased (killswitched) there has been an administrative kaibosh on internet access at the last day to return the thing. I was one hundred percent connected yet denied internet access (see screenshot) & had to use my older chromebook to set up the return.Updates: (third review)The replacement netbook from Samsung. Could Amazon be the unwitting host of a seller of stolen or even counterfeit goods? More and more programming irregularities keep  showing up. Like the pic I'm posting now: Prompted to use Guest Mode and/or Sign In when I already AM in Guest Mode...Still I really wanted to love the netbook but closer inspection showed more and more signs of excessive factory-programmed presets and physical scuff marks, even dings in the cover that evidenced this was a used chromebook. I would still give it four stars for the moments it did work, at one point my one-bar cell connection ran an hour-long documentary on Prime Video with virtually no interruptions, BUT once I attempted to use the logged-in owner account and install ZOOM and Bitdefender the thing just DIED!!! It won't charge, it won't turn on, NOTHING!!!Thank God I'm within the 30-day return period and bought the Assurion plan, but how disappointing to have to return it, it looks like if this sort of problem continues I might be profiled as a difficult customer.The main reason I selected this 6GB RAM Samsung Chromebook: the USB charging function, and for this I'd give it ten stars if possible.Drawbacks: The hi-speed charger that came with the unit just about overheated & I had to purchase the 45w adapter and a couple C-to-USB adapters separately, but my dream of keeping my off-grid connection charged from my rinkydink solar setup has now come true!Bonus Tips from a Non-techie: I'm not a techie here so I'm just wondering if the compatability between my Samsung phone and chromebook has boosted the connectivity through the use of tethering plus bluetooth. Whether it's the faster processor or whatnot, what took hours to load a 3-minute video before now loads instantly and this has saved me the time and expense of buying a signal booster.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K8G7663/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08QMSZR2C/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1","Samsung Chromebook 4 Chrome OS 11.6"" HD Intel Celeron Processor N4000 6GB RAM 64GB eMMC Gigabit Wi-Fi - XE310XBA-K03US",279,samsung

1823,K.

I also wanted one with an 11"" screen that had more memory and ram than the cheapest models.  This was pretty much the only Chromebook that fit those criteria.  I saw that most everyone liked it except for the screen, and I figured I had low enough demands for screen performance that it was worth a try.  I got a great deal on the 6/64 version, and I love it.  It's fast, lightweight, good keyboard, and the screen is fine for my philistine level of pixel appreciation.

1827,Cee Chance,2022,1,Chromebooks are the worst!,"I bought this laptop for my daughter (9 yrs old) to be her first laptop computer. I was looking for something that was somewhat easy to use and this chromebook popped up on a number of ""best first time laptops for kids"" lists. We've used it maybe a total of 3 times and it was a complete waste of money.First, the chromebook does not have the capabilities my daughter was looking for. This is our fault for not doing a little bit more research before buying (but this was more due to a miscommunication between parent and daughter). Unfortunately, this was a Christmas gift and my husband accidentally burned the box it came in on Christmas morning! So returning it wasn't an option. So we tried to make the best of it!The second issue is that the login and parent control features are too much. Every time my daughter tried to turn on the computer, we had to go through a lengthy process of entering a password, parent access code, password again, and sometimes we were then asked to enter all the parent email account information! It was totally ridiculous! And we even tried to adjust the settings to allow easier login but it seemed very arbitrary when we were or were not required to go through extra security levels to login.I'm not really sure why anyone would want to purchase a chromebook. They are junk. Limited capabilities (might as well buy a tablet) and everything is google dependent (not surprising but comes with too many limitations). I regret trying to buy a more affordable laptop for my kid.","Samsung Chromebook 4 Chrome OS 11.6"" HD Intel Celeron Processor N4000 6GB RAM 64GB eMMC Gigabit Wi-Fi - XE310XBA-K03US",279,samsung

1830,Cheryl Ann,2022,1,This Chromebook was 2.5 times more than the one I bought at Walmart and is even worse,"My first recommendation, is never buy a Chromebook. They are just terrible devices. First of all, the screen quality is horrible. You can't watch videos or movies, because it is terrible. You cannot brighten the screen, think of looking at a dingy gray screen that has no contrast. Between the two I bought and my friend's Chromebook, all from different manufacturers, it is clear that all Chromebooks have this problem. They don't have delete keys on the keyboard, and when I hook up an external keyboard, the enter, backspace, and several other keys do not work without pressing down the Shift key. The way your hand rests on the square hand control of the keyboard makes the curser jump around on you and do all sorts of things you don't want. So you cannot really use the device keyboard, you have to install and exterior one to do any real work. The devices are also very slow, which defeats the purpose. 6 GB Ram should be a lot faster. I had two ASUS notebooks a decade ago that were better in every regard. It is hard to navigate, hard to find what you need, really cannot use it for the word docs and other things. I really cannot think of one good thing about this Chromebook. This is NOT a touch screen device either, so know that upfront.","Samsung Chromebook 4 Chrome OS 11.6"" HD Intel Celeron Processor N4000 6GB RAM 64GB eMMC Gigabit Wi-Fi - XE310XBA-K03US",279,samsung

1879,Johnny_Amazon®,2021,4,"Great for Students, But Also Great for Adults, Especially for Travel","Since I'm not a student (Chromebooks are usually geared towards students), this review is mainly from a regular adult's point of view. Here is my reasoning for the title of my review - Chromebooks are perfect for travel because:1) Mainly because they are cheap, so in the event that you lose it or break it, you won't regret it so much.2) It is very light, especially for being a 14-inch laptop. At just over three pounds, it's beneficial for your carry-on luggage so you can save more leftover weight for your other essentials.3) The main difference between Chromebooks and regular laptops is that you can't install programs in the traditional sense. You have to use apps or extensions from Chrome. However, in this sense, the bright side is twofold: It allows for your computer to be more safe since you don't install programs onto it, and also it allows your laptop to perform faster since it's more streamlined in its purpose, which is a web-based/cloud-based laptop.4) A big 14-inch screen at this price is awesome. The bezels could have been thinner, especially at the top edge, but overall the screen is a plus considering the price. The battery life is also tremendous - I used it for a total of over six hours of surfing the web, watching movies, checking my emails, and it still had over 30% left. This is much better than my main laptop, which is an OLED 13"" HP Spectre x360.With this particular Chromebook from Samsung, I feel it is especially more faster than other Chromebooks I've used in the past. However, full disclosure, the last time I used a Chromebook was four years ago, so technology surely has since improved. There has been no lag for me so far when I'm using Chrome with a bunch of tabs open, including a few just for Gmail. I have also watched movies on Netflix.com, and it can handle all that running at once.With that out of the way, here are a few niggles that I was disappointed by. First and foremost is the screen, which is decent and expected of cheap laptops at this price range. Nonetheless, it's disappointing since it's Samsung, and I had expected better, since I have and have used so many Samsung products in the past it has made me jaded. It is not very bright, not made for outdoor use, with very limited viewing angles. The screen being at 14 inches was definitely a plus. especially since the whole la[top weighs just over three pounds, but I just wish it was better quality. And finally, the specs on this is a measly 4gb of RAM and only 32gb of flash memory drive. It would have been nice if they had an upgrade option of a better screen and specs for like $100 more.Taking everything into consideration, I still enthusiastically recommend this laptop. It's something you can buy just for a trip, and then back at home have as a secondary laptop that you rarely would use, and it would still not be a wasted buy. That's because with the overall package of everything put together, it's a great value: Big screen, great battery life, super lightweight, snappy performance, all at a great price of under $300.","Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Go Laptop Computer Lightweight Slim Durable Design 12-Hour Battery Wi-Fi 6 Share Files with Phone, Black,Silver,32GB",289,samsung
1880,Daniel M. Stoff,2022,1,Sim card Failure,"Got my Chromebook via AT&T 9 months ago.Everything worked great on it until an update from Google Chrome OS borked the Sim card.My attempts to get it resolved via AT&T failed, as they don't know how to fix it, and from my sleuthing online, Samsung cannot fix this either.Further, according to Samsung, it is a known failure on these Chromebooks and should be avoided. However, AT&T continues to sell them, knowing there are problems with the Chromebook.For what I've contracted to pay, I am not getting my monies worth, nor can I use the Chromebook on anything other than WiFi, which was not my intention when I got it.For those who may look at this review, All info regarding the failure and known failure is available online from various sites via Google.By beware, but, if you are only going to use it with WiFi, then you might be OK.","Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Go Laptop Computer Lightweight Slim Durable Design 12-Hour Battery Wi-Fi 6 Share Files with Phone, Black,Silver,32GB",289,samsung
1881,EndUser,2021,4,"Decent Chromebook, mediocre display, pretty quick for what it is, long battery life","If you're in the market for a low cost Chromebook, and you're willing to live with a screen that's not the best, especially by today's standards, this might be a good option. If you must have a nice display, look elsewhere. The screen in this one is not IPS, and the viewing angles are limited, the resolution is only 1366x768.That said, everything else is good. It's quick, runs smooth, power through everything I threw at it. It streams 4K/60 content from YouTube without dropping frames. (you'll want an external display to appreciate it though!) Benchmarks are better than I expected given it's specs. Results were better than 70% of all users that ran the same benchmark, and 80% better then those using ChromeOS. I used it all day, then into the next and still had over 50% battery left, which it estimated to be nearly 8 more hours of runtime. I think the spec'd 12hr battery life is very realistic. Samsung did a good job tuning this one to get all it's potential, efficiently. Even stressing it like this it doesn't get hot, just barely warm. There's no fans or anything for cooling, so it remains totally silent.The keys feel good, though spacing is a little weird for me. I'll get used to it over time, I guess the same can be said for any new keyboard. The touch pad works well and is responsive. I like that it has a hardware button for clicking, or a tap will also work. It supports the usual gestures and all feels natural.Sound quality is surprisingly good. It's clear and loud with good lows, mids, and highs. The two speakers are down firing mounted in the bottom, and will get a bit muffled when using on a soft surface.The camera is just OK, not great by any means. It will do for Skype and the like, but that's about it.","Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Go Laptop Computer Lightweight Slim Durable Design 12-Hour Battery Wi-Fi 6 Share Files with Phone, Black,Silver,32GB",289,samsung
1882,TM,2021,5,Samsung Quality With Google Hype,"I generally don’t like Chromebooks. They are under-powered and for what they are overpriced. Mainly since so many students had to work from home, and demand for these spiked almost overnight.They started with the noble idea to be an affordable alternative to regular spec notebooks, got more expensive over the years, to the point of a price-bubble that pushed even older models into $500 territory. And still most think of them as an affordable option to ‘real’ computers.The reason why these are so omnipresent is because Google talked school districts into the idea that they are safe to use and easy to administrate. And while there are some really nice rugged models that are built to resist even the above average careless student abuse, many are just cheaply made low-spec laptops. Often using a privately used computer with a different operating system (Lubuntu on an older notebook works great) would do, but some school apps ask for some deep gripping admin rights on the computer. Something I personally don’t want to allow on a device for personal use.But here we are, the new school year begins and many of us parents would rather buy a Chromebook than use a dated one issued by the school. It's either sign up for a ridiculous expensive device insurance or sign to pay in case of damage.  Our school district wants $350 to replace an over ten year old Lenovo in case of a total loss!So putting down the money for this Samsung actually makes sense. Especially since it’s reasonably priced. There isn’t too much to say about the specs. It’s there where it should be, and it works. Samsung is a good brand with a wide variety of products. From all the Samsung products we own and owned, they have been very reliable. I still have a 2014 Galaxy S10 that still keeps going after I handed it down to my daughter.The display is crisp and sharp, the battery life is good for a few hours off the plug, and the quality and feel is great and above average in this price segment. The fact that it looks like metal, but isn’t makes it IMO feel a bit cheaper when touching it. That’s a brain trick and wouldn’t be an issue at all with a solid colored case.The design is inline with the wedge-trend. I wish it would be more functional like older Dells, with the rubber edge and water resistant keyboard, but there are other good options to protect the device from hits and drops. This also means the keyboard is flat with very short travel, meaning the tactile feedback is flat rather than a press like on a traditional full size keyboard.I like that it still comes with a traditional USB-A (the big square) port aside the modern USB-C (small roundish) ports. That means it’s still able to handle older cables, thumb drives, etc. while USB-C gets rid of clunky proprietary power adapters. Also headphone jack!For myself as a parent I can only say: It sucks that options are so limited when it comes down to choosing devices, especially since I would prefer not to have Google peeking into my kids' school career, but for what it is, this is a good choice for a Chromebook; Especially for teens and older who prefer to have their own devices and some style along with it.  So that’s five stars for the product, but with the call to all parents to always ask if there are options to using Chrome OS and if not, why?I hope this helps to make a decision.","Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Go Laptop Computer Lightweight Slim Durable Design 12-Hour Battery Wi-Fi 6 Share Files with Phone, Black,Silver,32GB",289,samsung
1883,Bruce and Kathy O'Gorman,2021,5,Love it!,"You know what, I love it!  As a windows laptop user, I was hesitant to make the jump to a Chromebook.  I was fearful the user experience would be tough to adapt to, and I'd end up chucking it in the drawer of other devices I lost interest in using.  I stand corrected!  I love this little laptop, here is what I've noticedPros:1. Battery life is GREAT, I get almost an entire day of surfing and light office work.  Far more than any other  windows based laptop I've used.2. Charging is fast as well.  I can get this thing topped off and ready to keep going while sipping some coffee in the coffee shop doing work.  Before I head out, it's fully charged and ready to go.3. Screen size is great, just big enough to make it easy to see and use, but small enough to keep it compact and easy to transport.  It's also THIN, in a good way.4. very lightweight.6. The keyboard feels great with excellent feedback and spacing.  The center mouse is small enough my wrists don't brush it by accident when typing.7.  Chrome apps work great and there is a lot of integration and cross-function between them.8. Price, it's a great little web server and light-duty word processing and email computer.Cons:1. It may not be Google's fault, but it does not play well with competing apps like Firefox browsers.  Don't expect to find apps with heavy processing needs, no Photoshops etc.  Everything in the Chrome Store is a ""lite version"" but still gets it done.2.  Gestures will take some getting used to.  Instead of a right-click, you two-finger press.3. App layout is a bit cumbersome, file management is as well.4.  Camera quality is still meh.  In the days of Zoom, it's sad the camera on laptops still looks like it's from an old early 2000s flip-phone.  Surely they have better camera tech from their phones they can stick in these things.Overall, a Chromebook makes a great on-the-go tool for anything you'd expect to be able to do on your phone, but with a real keyboard and large screen, and exceptional battery life.  I find this my go-to laptop when I just need to ""get some stuff done""","Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Go Laptop Computer Lightweight Slim Durable Design 12-Hour Battery Wi-Fi 6 Share Files with Phone, Black,Silver,32GB",289,samsung
1884,Knowlengr,2021,3,"Get it for MIL STD testing, Battery Life and Wi-Fi 6","You can get a lot for 300.00 US today.  For amusement, look at mini-PC's, which need external keyboard, mouse and display, but come with desktop-like capabilities and are expandable for more memory.  Sure, they're not laptops, but the core machine is portable, in fact more so than a laptop, so long as your destination has the requisite keyboard, mouse and display.I disgress.For 300.00 US in this instance, you get a long battery life and good Wi-Fi 6, which could be essential for on-the-road journalism, student notes or remote lab projects.If you're an Android user, you get many settings and preferences moved automatically when you set it.  Contrast that with Windows laptops, where more steps are needed to install the apps you need. (Partly this is because Microsoft abandoned their mobile platform.)Samsung made some compromises here, but sometimes you want bare bones.  The machine might be used only occasionally, for children, or may need to be dedicated to a particular purpose, or is needed for public use and will get beat up. Finesse, higher cost, weight and power give you more features, but they are not always needed.I'd like to comment on the ""military grade"" aspect that is claimed, but I didn't see a way to test MILSTD 810G findings.  Let's just say that this is a definite plus for many environments.PRO- Like most current Chromebooks, can use many different USB-C chargers, so long as they have enough wattage for this Galaxy book- Fast setup for Android phone users (as with all Chromebooks)- Good price point- Wi-Fi 6 will be noticeably faster for some users- Battery life is good (12 hrs may be a stretch though, depending on what tasks you throw at it)- 3 USB ports enables external mouse, keyboard, camera/mic (some laptops have fewer ports on their low end offeringts)- MILSTD 810G testingCON- Memory is limited- Screen isn't great at this below-HD resolution but it's fine for most tasks- It's very light, but at 14"", I wish it were closer to 11 or 12 for still better portability. Samsung makes smaller ones but not with these other features- You will miss having a touch screen as you come off your Samsung Galaxy phone- It's ChromeOS which won't have some apps for some users.","Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Go Laptop Computer Lightweight Slim Durable Design 12-Hour Battery Wi-Fi 6 Share Files with Phone, Black,Silver,32GB",289,samsung
1885,N. Krumpe,2021,4,"Disappointing display, but reasonable for the price","The low-resolution display and washed out colors are the first things I noticed about this Chromebook. All in all, the display is just kind of disappointing. I know: It's a low-cost Chromebook, and so I should adjust my expectations appropriately. But still, it's hard not for me to get disratcted by the display.Also, I got the model with 32GB of storage. However, 13 of those 32 are used for the system, bringing the available storage down to 19GB. And then, I installed Linux, and the installer recommended that I set aside 10GB for Linux storage. So, now I'm down to 9GB of Chromebook storage. Of course, given that this is a Chromebook, one would not expect as much storage as one would finde on a Windows or Mac machine.Are you using this primarily for editing Google docs and watching YouTube videos? If so, you don't need much storage space (because documents are generally stored in the cloud), and the screen resolution is acceptable. But if you want a Chromebook with decent specs, including a sharp image and plenty of storage, this most definitely is NOT the Chromebook you should be considering alternatives.","Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Go Laptop Computer Lightweight Slim Durable Design 12-Hour Battery Wi-Fi 6 Share Files with Phone, Black,Silver,32GB",289,samsung

I used this mostly for word processing type work with cloud based storage and was impressed! It’s zippy and convenient with the built in Wifi 6.The one feature that is lacking is the display. The resolution is just fine for simple programs, but not super great for any video work. If you are planning on editing videos or photos I don’t think this display will do you any favors. The outer shell is plastic even though it looks metallic in photos, and honestly makes it feel more portable than an expensive MacBook.

Aesthetically, it looks good with a familiar wedge shape in silver plastic with a black interior. It feels sturdy and rigid. The keyboard is nicely laid out and has good key action for typing. The trackpad is a decent size and tracks smoothly. The Chromebook charges via USB-C - wall charger and USB-C cable is included. There are two USB-C connectors, USB-A, headphone jack and microSD card slot. Battery life is quite good - I was able to go for an extended editing session for a few hours and still had plenty of battery left. It comes with 32 GB of storage which is sufficient for editing documents, spreadsheets, surfing the web or other lightweight tasks since most content is stored in the cloud. Performance is fine - it feels responsive and never left me waiting. Playback of 1080p streaming video is smooth. The one area of needed improvement is the display. Viewing angles are restricted and colors are not as saturated as they could be - but adjusted at the right angle it’s OK in use. On the other hand, the sound is good - nice midrange and high end, with a bit of bass.

The end of life for the  samsung chromebook 3 is this year in June. I've been looking for an affordable chromebook similar to what I have now and has the farthest end of life date so far for price.The Samsung chromebook go is just that. I also was able to make payments as well. It's a way wider screen and even though I see many reviews on how bad the screen is, the chromebook 3 from the same maker is the same quality as well, but this chromebook go looks good to me. It's sleek trying to pose as a MacBook. It's light and has a USB C charging cable that's perfect for my Samsung s21 phone as well. I also play games on it with my Amazon Luna account and it's faster than my phone, old chromebook, Kindle, and fire stick when playing games.I've had PC laptops that were at the 500 price range and they could install programs, but starting it up would take 10 minutes and it was slow loading anything.

1893,Josh,2022,3,Basic device for basic tasks,"I'm split on this device. On one hand it doesn't have a great screen, it's memory and storage limited, the processor isn't very powerful, and it only has a single standard USB port. On the other hand it is compact, has decent battery life, an alright build quality for a cheap device, has an SD card slot, and does an passable job when it comes to writing, spreadsheets, surfing the web, watching videos, and even light gaming.Chrome OS, on the other hand, seems to struggle with most things. It lacks some of the basic functionality you expect of a modern OS and can be anti-intuitive to use.  It has stability issues with apps, especially ones that compete with Google's own (such as Firefox).Thankfully you can install a basic Linux build for things like Libre Office, but many programs installed that way also seem to have stability issues (like VLC Media Player).The built in media player works but has a terrible interface and limited control, and only the terrible mobile versions of other media players seem to work right. The device has speakers, but they aren't very loud and seem crackly -- thankfully a headphone jack is included.It has no touchscreen and the trackpad is possibly the worst I've ever used, to the point of being frustrating and/or not working the way I want it to -- partly because of the OS, itself, and partly because it doesn't have any buttons or anything available to assist its functionality. A mouse is necessary for comfortable use.The keyboard is alright, comfortable to type on.Honestly, though, if I had the choice to go back and purchase something else I probably would. I'm not sure Google's operating system is for me -- you can't even use the desktop to place shortcuts or folders! I would just get a regular laptop and install Linux Mint on it. Doing so would result in an experience that is far more intuitive, stable, and with the benefit of having access to the functionality of a full fledged OS (and all the programs available for it).At the same time, this will do for most the things I bought it for, just less than expected in some respects.Buy if you want something super basic to write on, look stuff up on, and to keep records.

1905,GMFL,2021,3,Great Little Chromebook but Be Aware of Limitations,"I'll start with the Cons:Cons: If you have a community internet system at an apartment or condo that requires a password to access the system, you will not be able to get online without jumping through a lot of hoops.  You will need to use another device (smart phone or Windows device) to get the information that explains how to do so, and it is complicated.  Buying a Chromebook is  for the purpose of simplicity and you won't be able to configure your Chromebook until you get past that hurdle.  The other con is that you cannot download the latest version of the Alexa app because it is not compatible with this unit.  If your purpose is to control/configure your smart home or other Alexa connected devices, you can't do it with this particular Chromebook.  If you want to get a Windows based laptop in the same price range, it will be in ""S"" mode, which is great; however, you will need to turn off ""S"" mode to get anything from an app store that is NOT Microsoft and can only use the Edge browser, again, by turning off S mode.  There is a simple way to remove ""S"" mode (which is for security) but once you take it off, you can never put it back on. so be aware.Pros: This is a fine looking, easy to use Chromebook that works as a Chromebook should - fast and easy to understand as long as you don't have the above listed situation.  It does not have a touch screen and the screen resolution is okay for the price point.  If you need this for a home schooled student or for just a quick way to browse the internet and make online purchases, this item is worth the money.

However, after a few weeks of using it I have discovered some quirks about the chromebook that I find to be rather irritating as I am a creature of habit. The first one being, there is NO delete button. I don't think this would be a deal breaker at first, but it is slightly annoying. The second one being, whenever I want to write an email, I can't press ""tab"" to indent anymore.  In fact, it seems like I can't do it in any box that I can put text in, such as the box for this review. The third thing, being that you can NOT right click without pressing the ""alt"" tab. Last but not least, there is no way to add apps to the background of this device. The shortcuts are the only way to have apps available. While I understand this isn't necessarily a laptop and that features guaranteed to be different, all four of these issues combined has caused enough irritation for me to write this review. Don't get me wrong, this laptop is great for school. The web camera is wonderful, I don't have any connection issues, but these weird perks are very annoying. Had I known that the chromebooks were designed like that, it would have eased my frustrations getting use to this, or I would have considered getting something else.","SAMSUNG Galaxy Chromebook 4 11.6-inch 64GB eMMC, 4GB RAM, Gigabit Wi-Fi, Chrome OS, HD Intel Celeron Processor N4000",233,samsung
1910,Amazon Customer,2020,4,Product good - service not so much,"This is my first Chromebook. I did alot of inquiring and research prior to purchasing. When it arrived, therse was an issue with getting signed on. After trying myself for a couple of days, I decided to call support. I am pretty sure the gentleman I spoke with has never seen a Chromebook. He had to stop and look up every possible issue and even argued with me at times. One for instance, he told me to find the 2 buttons on the scroll and click the right one. THERE ARE NOT TWO buttons. It is one smooth pad like most laptops have. After an hour of speaking with him, I was getting quite irritated. He finally decided I had to mail it in for service. They sent me a shipping label with an incorrect name and mailing address. I then had to contact them again. The ""supervisor"" stated she would send a corrected label. This NEVER came. Eventually my son came for visit from 2000 miles away and had it fixed in less than 15 minutes. SAMSUNG: PLEASE get some people in your tech support that have a clue.Once signed on, this is a great little machine. I read so many negatives about the poor quality of the screen and I DO NOT see a problem. It is clear and bright.

1942,Tyler Ward,2021,5,Slim Sleek Beautiful Power Hungry Beast,"A good place to start would be that I got this chromebook at a discount ($749, down from $999). And my needs are mainly to run Citrix (through browser or Chrome app, either works) for work and to casually browse, read magazines/books or listen to Spotify.  Not a ""Power User"" by any means, though not sure any Chrome OS user is.That being said, this is THE BEST CHROMEBOOK I'VE EVER USED, and it is more than perfect to suit my needs.Build: The thing is beautiful, a really premium feel to the materials, and the red is really classy and not too gaudy as I was a bit worried and almost went with the more drab grey option - I'm glad I didn't. The chrome ring around the outside is also a premium touch that looks great. It's the thinnest and lightest 2-in-1 laptop I've ever seen, and I know that I like to use 2-in-1s in tablet mode and this is the first time it actually feels comfortable and feasible to do that for more than a brief period of time. The 2.2lbs was a big draw for me when comparing this laptop to the Galaxy Chromebook 2, Asus C436, or the Acer Spin 713 - upon using it I am glad I took it into consideration. Other great things about the build are the relatively loud stereo speakers and the built-in stylus. Minor drawbacks would be the weak hinge that doesn't always hold the screen in place when moving the laptop if open (though for the most part it does the job) and the lack of ports (you just get 2 USB-C ports, which also function as charging ports, so if you're charging you only have 1...adapters easily solve this). Also the cameras are weak but I don't use those - if you're buying for camera quality only for some reason (Zoom?) then this isn't the one for you.Screen: The SCREEN is AMAZING. The OLED is top notch and better than any Chromebook I've ever seen, at full brightness the colors are insane. That being said, the high resolution and the brightness eat at the battery life a lot, so in most cases I've got brightness scaled way down and I don't really miss anything, it works fine. Touch works perfectly, the stylus allows for really detailed notes/drawings in Canva or other apps. One drawback might be the bezel placement, there are 3 super-thin outer bezels and one larger bottom bezel... in tablet mode that one larger bezel functions well as a ""handle"" of sorts, but the other sides can't be touched without accidentally hitting the screen and scrolling or clicking a link, etc. A very minor nuisance at most. Another minor issue is that the resolution is SO GOOD that when I run Citrix, the session almost appears blurry, but still workable - on high resolution windows machines Citrix has addressed this with DPI scaling, but they've yet to master this on the Chrome OS app or the Chrome web app. Not Samsung's issue, but still part of my experience with the machine so I thought it worth mentioning.Performance: This thing is a BEAST. There's arguably no need for an Intel i5 in a Chromebook, but here we are, and the thing is FAST. Scrolling is smooth and even with tons of tabs open I've never experienced lag when playing videos or games. With lots going on under the hood, and no fan, I've heard mention from others that the computer can get really hot under heavy loads - I've barely experienced this while using a decent amount of processing power, and would elaborate that when I did feel heat it was very minor and not unbearable by any means. I'm thinking unless you are gaming a lot or developing in linux or doing something really really processor heavy, you'll be fine. A small performance gripe in general is that Android apps don't always play well with Chrome OS and have re-sizing issues or some lag, but this is not a Samsung problem, more of a Google problem.Battery Life: Some people have called this the achilles heel of the laptop, but I don't have much issue. Again, I'm not a real gamer/developer/super user - I am Joe Basic using it for administrative work and browsing/music/reading. On an average day at like 70% brightness I can unplug at 8am and make it to about 3 or 4pm before having to plug back in while working in Citrix doing basic tasks on MS Access, Excel, etc - nothing intense but that's pretty much constant screentime for about 6-7 hours before it starts getting low and I've got to plug in. Obviously this is not great in comparison to 10+ hours at full brightness seen on other Chromebooks - but you are getting more than the average Chromebook here and this is a bit of a concession made on Samsung's part to provide the rest of the goods. Overall if you don't need to be away from a charger for more than 6 hours every day, you shouldn't have an issue.Should you buy it: If you have read this far and think your needs/usage are similar to mine and you want the sleek-est, coolest, thinnest chromebook out there, DEFINITELY BUY THIS (especially if on discount, which it frequently is between Amazon, Best Buy, and Samdsung's own site).","SAMSUNG 13.3"" Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, HD Intel Core I-5 Processor, Ultra Slim, US Warranty, Fiesta Red",1033,samsung
1943,RemixDaMix,2022,4,Beautiful image poor battery.,"Bought this Chromebook because it was decently priced (under $600), didn't have a Celeron, was thin and wanted to try my hand at something that wasn't Windows based.Took a bit of time figuring out how to navigate and am kind of still learning but this laptop is very appealing for what I was wanting to use it for. It's the only Chromebook I know with a 4k resolution screen, not that I was wanting it for that, but the image quality looks stunning. The i-5 processor is fast enough to handle most any daily functions and the thin stylings of the laptop itself is very appealing. It comes with a stylus that's installed directly into the machine and works flawlessly. Audio isn't anything to brag about but does get plenty loud for most entertainment options. I normally use it to watch a sports game while playing board games with friends or watching Youtube videos to learn said board games. Convertible mode is exactly what you'd expect but was surprised the laptop doesn't get extremely hot when the screen is folded to block the air vents. Is small and light enough that it doesn't seem so burdensome but large enough that it doesn't feel like I'm typing on something meant for a child.My biggest issue though is the 4k screen. I can watch all forms of resolution on this laptop but have no options to force the resolution to something lower to help save on battery life and boy is the 4k screen a energy hog. My entire view point before buying this was that I knew the battery life wasn't that great but figured I'd just lower the resolution and get whatever I could out of the battery but was disappointed to find out that's impossible. Don't get me wrong the 4k screen is beyond beautiful but now I need to plan accordingly if I'll be out and about with this Chromebook, something I didn't really expect when purchasing the product.All in all I'm happy with this product and as long as the battery life isn't a complete deal breaker then I highly recommend.","SAMSUNG 13.3"" Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, HD Intel Core I-5 Processor, Ultra Slim, US Warranty, Fiesta Red",1033,samsung
1944,Kindle Customer,2021,3,"The best resolution screen of any computer, but otherwise there are many issues.","If I needed a computer merely for streaming content and wanted the best quality and highest resolution, then this is the clear leader and without exception the best offered in the market.  If you need it to do other things it is best to look at something else.Despite the short battery life (around 4 hours of continuous use video streaming of Amazon prime HD offerings), I was willing to accept that, but constant and continuous other issues resulted in making me nuts.  So what are the issues?1. It gets hot and I don't mean warm, I mean hot enough to redden the skin if you are holding it on your lap.  Everytime it got that hot which happens after using it for over a hour or so, I would elevate it on a rack I use for cooling cookies when they come out of the oven.  This allowed air to constantly be under the laptop.  Did it help?  No.  If you are intending to use this for several hours straight, you need to invest in a base which has a fan blowing cool air onto the bottom.  This means the portabiity just went out the window.2. Touchscreen fails to respond.  It is maddening to be in the middle of a project only to have your touch screen stop responding to touch, provided epen, touch pad or cursor with a mouse.  It was necessary to close everything down and restart the computer to fix it.3.  Keyboard touches opens random programs.  This one was really puzzling.  I would be typing and all of a sudden an program would open.  I assumed I must have inadvertently touched something on the keyboard while typing, but have no clue as to what it was.  Since I didn't know what caused it, I was unable to avoid doing it.4. Weird keyboards show up on touch screen and you cant get them to close.  I know there are times when you are using this in tablet mode that you want the keyboard to be on the screen.  However why one would appear when you are typing was yet another mystery.  How to get rid of it was equally puzzling.  To add insult to injury, the keyboard which would show up differed from one time to another.  Occasionally it was the Qwerty type, but frequently it was not.  (One of them had row upon row of yellow circle face icons for heavens sake!)  I would get rid of one only to have another show up.5. Settings change without my input.  You go to settings and have the computer's cursor, screen layout, wallpaper etc all set up to your own personal preferences.  Then without any rhyme or reason they are changed.  Yes it is easy to go back and set them again, but I shouldn't have to do this and it is a pain in the butt to keep reconfiguring they physical look of the display.6. Bluetooth devices don't always stay paired.  Once you have scanned and selected a blue tooth device, I am used to it always being on the list of available devices which you can then click to quickly reconnect.  Here on a few occasions I had to go back to the repairing process to get them to connect.  Again another time waster.There were othe6 I knew about before I purchased such as there only being a couple C type outlets.  I had this issue with another Samsung product so had already purchased the doogle (dongle?) so that I could plug in my memory cards, usb and micro USB cords.Other positives are the look. This had to be the best looking laptop I have ever seen.  Only the blue Samsung Galaxy laptop for windows looks as good. The built in epin when working was fabulous.  You could set it up to magnify the screen, take a screenshot, etc so it allowed versatility not often seen in similar chromebooks.  It is fast.  Everything moved so quickly, and the processing was better than any other chromebook I have used to date.I know the new Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 has worked to solve some of these issues.  Unfortunately that has been done at the expense of factors which made the thing so great to start out with.  In short if these are ever just a few hundred dollars I will get one for video streaming as I do a lot of it.  But for over 600.?

1946,Blugo_47,2022,4,Patience is KEY! Also speakers are kind of meh.....,"Had to go through 3 devices to finally get one that was properly built, as Samsung's quality control is really hit or miss, especially for this device for some reason, so you're basically playing the lottery. Luckily, Amazon's customer service is one of the best in the industry so I was able to get one that functioned properly and was assembled correctly. As far as how it performs, you won't be disappointed, I view this as more of a leisure device opposed to productivity, so far that use case it really is a treat. The screen is gorgeous, blacks are actually black, contrast is through the roof, and colors are so vibrant and full of life that you'll struggle going back to regular screens. The build quality(when you get a good unit) is great, very premium and sturdy, while still being very lightweight. It feels really nice in the hands, and it has the benefit of being just as nice to use as it is to look at. Seriously this is one of the most beautiful computers out there, not just for a chromebook, the metallic cherry red just pops and the silver chrome edges are such a nice touch, it really is a shame that Samsung doesn't offer this color scheme in any other device, I'd love to see it on a windows laptop for example, and like won't ever. All in all, this is a rather expensive chromebook, you're definitely paying a premium for this device, but if you're looking for a great screen, beautiful design, in a premium lightweight chassis, that functions as a tablet replacement of sorts, then this is the chromebook for you.","SAMSUNG 13.3"" Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, HD Intel Core I-5 Processor, Ultra Slim, US Warranty, Fiesta Red",1033,samsung

1948,CloudE Solutions,2022,3,Amazing laptop with very poor battery and heating issues.,"I regret purchasing this laptop on the promise that Samsung was working with Google regarding the power issue.  Samsung seems caught off guard with the battery life being only 4 hours with very consrvitive power usage.I have been looking around for an improved battery to replace the one that came inside my Samsun Galaxy Chromebook but doesn't seem to be anything new out there.  Unfortunately I have a laptop that can only be used around 4 hours on battery.This said I have been watching videos on Youtube where owners claim they get 6-8 hours of battery with brightness to 80+ percent, do i have a  bad battery or they happen to have a better release?Everything else about this Chromebook seems fine, however, my 8gb isn't that as I look to see the ram it uses 7.65Gb, this is Chromebook thing because traditionally you would have much more available for programs you have yet to opena nd run?  Less than 1 Gb available for whatever lolFinding programs in the app store that is full screen or landscape is difficult and have found some that do do not run well at all... the Galaxy Chromebook is concidered a very powerful machine, but seems to struggle at almost anything I load into it except games.  I did load a simple game but failed to keep running and crashes constantly.Perhaps I am asking too much from this Chromebook, I do not do much, mostly edit my website, write small blogs, spreadsheets, email and videos on YT and movies I've purchased.  That pretty much it!I don't recommend this model.Before all of this, I tried to order the original Pixelbook but Amazon accidentally sent me a high end Pixelbook Go (Not PInk), and being the honest person I am returned it and then ended up ordering the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook instead.","SAMSUNG 13.3"" Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, HD Intel Core I-5 Processor, Ultra Slim, US Warranty, Fiesta Red",1033,samsung
1949,Glenn Brensinger,2021,4,Great device!,"This thing is so cool! Usually I try to go with the latest and greatest if I can justify the cost, but the reviews of this year’s Chromebook 2 vs last year’s Chromebook helped me make the decision to go with last year’s model. Better screen, fingerprint reader, and the fact that instead of $999 it cost less than $600 (plus some credit I already had with Amazon, so I paid less than $300 for it.) It’s starting to compete with my iPad Pro as my daily driver, since most of what I do is web based anyway.The only issue I have is with the touch screen. When I flip the screen to put it in tablet mode, the touch screen stops working until I restart it. The problem is I can’t tell if it’s a hardware problem / defective unit, or if there is an issue with the latest release of ChromeOS. Unfortunately I have asked the question in three places and have not received a response. I am hoping it’s just a glitch with the Chrome OS, because I really like this thing. I even have Crossover running Windows apps and have had no issues with lagging. It’s not getting warm at all (there is no cooling fan.) Did I mention you can run Linux apps on a Chromebook now too? I wasn’t sure about the Fiesta Red, at first I thought it would be too loud, but I’m glad I did it. Shiny and cool looking.Update to my review - the touch screen problem was fixed by Powerwashing it.","SAMSUNG 13.3"" Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, HD Intel Core I-5 Processor, Ultra Slim, US Warranty, Fiesta Red",1033,samsung
1950,WUA (Christian Walloth),2021,4,A stunning notebook,"I'd definitely buy this notebook again. And not only because it's the most fancy chromebook on the market. But also because ...It's super thin, super lightweight. Yet it feels sturdy and well built. It's hard to spot any piece of plastic on this notebook.The orange-red color is just beautiful. It's not anything near a sharp or aggressive orange. It's a super warm, slightly metallic color. Truly particular. It sits beautifully on wooden desks as well as on any more office-like desk surface. The color tone changes slightly with the light.It has an exchangeable SSD. Not an (slower) eMMC, and neither is it a non-replaceable chip. Whoever had to trash an entire notebook just because the SSD or eMMC failed, knows that having this unit replaceable matters. Also financially.The keyboard feels great. What a masterpiece of engineering. I mean, the whole lower part of the notebook is barely 6mm thick.Not to talk about the display. It probably outperforms most others on the market (and particularly at this price point).What they talk about in reviews, negatively:- short battery life. Indeed. 4-6hrs. That's few. But if they'd asked me to increase battery life and weight and size or leave it at it is, I'd opted for as it is. I just don't need more than 4-6 hrs of battery life; there's always a plug somewhere.- shaking display: true – when used on the lap while sitting on the sofa. When the notebook sits on a stable surface, like a desk, the hinges hold the display in place and it won't shake.What they don't talk about and what I personally find is a shortcoming:- the quality of sound from the internal speakers is low and I cannot enjoy it for all the video conferences we are having nowadays.Some people ask, why someone would need such a powerful chromebook. Because google understood the cloud, because there's no need for servicing, updating, IT people for your (small) business company. Because it's productivity focused. And because, yes, I literally have about 100 tabs open all the time, on different virtual screens, and sometimes even two accounts logged in, and it is still fast.","SAMSUNG 13.3"" Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, HD Intel Core I-5 Processor, Ultra Slim, US Warranty, Fiesta Red",1033,samsung

I also have a Dell XPS 13 i7 32GB.Pros: The Samsung Galaxy chromebook has the best keyboard, best tablet mode experience (on par w/ pixelbook); best pen, IMO (lag free in most cases); great screen. Chrome OS has become a very powerful OS, with Linux, android and phone controls.Battery: Better than expected. I get 6+hrs normally, and everything is blazingly fast, until I do a zoom call... then it gets burning hot and when using a whiteboard app, it starts to lag. However, google meet and other video calls work great, without heating up. I'm a scientist, mostly using it to write/read papers, run some python (locally and ssh), listen to music etc.Other Cons: gets hot on zoom calls; 8GB not enough for chromebooks anymore. Technical: Chrome Os does a good job managing memory and I haven't had issues, but htop in dev mode linux shows 6gb is filled up from startup (mostly due to Android) and I routinely see 7/11 gb of swap memory is filled.","SAMSUNG 13.3"" Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, HD Intel Core I-5 Processor, Ultra Slim, US Warranty, Fiesta Red",1033,samsung

The beautiful screen, the nice, keyboard, and glass trackpad make it an easy buy. The bottom bezel actually makes the screen look bigger if it was still thirteen inches. If you have the money and a 13 inch screen is enough for you, buy it. If you are used to a 15 inch screen I promise the transition is easy. I went from a 15.5 inch to a 13.3 inch chromebook and it was much easier than expected.Should you buy it(if you have the money): YESOverall score: 9.4/10 (10 is the perfect laptop which will not happen for several years)","SAMSUNG 13.3"" Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, HD Intel Core I-5 Processor, Ultra Slim, US Warranty, Fiesta Red",1033,samsung
1954,Mohammad Ashori,2021,3,Disappointing but beautiful,"The laptop is pretty to look at and it's thin. The screen is a really nice quality but doesn't outshine a MacBook but maybe a little better than the pixelbool. When you use it as a tablet it doesn't close fully so it's floppy and you can't really hold it because the bezels are so small you're always touching the screen. A common issue many have reported is the touchpad which jumps all over but that's a software issue with other apps which are incompatible. I deleted a bunch and it worked but dunno which was the culprit.If you are buying this because you hope to use other Samsung devices with this seamlessly, well, my galaxy buds don't always pair with this and there is no interface which I was surprised by. In fact you can't use the apps for galaxy devices with this Chromebook.It doesn't recognize my Samsung phone even which my Google pixelbook does a slightly better job at. The fingerprint scanner works maybe 50 percent of the time because it doesn't pick up my fingerprints well. Battery life isn't great but it hasn't been too bad for me. It's fast and rarely have I seen it glitch. I would have returned it for sure if I was still in the US but I bought it and left the country. I bought it to replace my pixelbook wthoch I've beat up a lot but even in it's poor state I use the pixelbook 90 percent of the time.I wanted to add to this review - it's really hard to use this laptop because when you turn it into a tablet it doesn't close all the way so you're holding something a little floppy. And the edges of the screen are so small that you're constantly activating something with your finger pads. Ironically, as sensitive as these edges are when you click on something on the screen it doesn't really register the finger well and you have to press a little hard.I'm comparing this to my Chromebook Pixel and it lacks a lot.Update March 2022.The screen quality isn't that high to explain why the battery runs out so fast. The screen not closing all the way against the case in tablet mode remains a big problem in terms of usability.I can't manage to keep the pads of my hand to activate the screen when maneuvering this laptop. A zero bezel is terrible even on a phone much less a touchscreen laptop.","SAMSUNG 13.3"" Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, HD Intel Core I-5 Processor, Ultra Slim, US Warranty, Fiesta Red",1033,samsung

The overall build quality of the Chromebook and the screen quality is absolutely brilliant. I was a bit nervous about Chrome OS, but its incredibly intuitive and feels a lot like Mac OS. Linux apps were a bit of a hassle to download, but they ran perfectly.The battery life is just unacceptable. After multiple tries, I was not able to get more than 4 hours of battery on less than 50% brightness. This Chromebook cannot be used as a mobile machine, unless you plan on being next to an outlet all the time. I bought this Chromebook for taking notes in class, but this wouldn't even last a half a day of classes. Only buy this if you don't plan on using it while mobile. It also can get hot to the touch, but it never went above 70 C.I ended up returning the Chromebook and got the Samsung Galaxybook Pro 360 instead, and I'm much happier with this purchase. It doesn't beat the screen on Samsung's Chromebook, but the battery life last all day and there's only a noticeable difference in the screen quality when up close.","SAMSUNG 13.3"" Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, HD Intel Core I-5 Processor, Ultra Slim, US Warranty, Fiesta Red",1033,samsung

The chrome OS makes the 8Gb of RAM and i5 core processor seem like overkill for what I use it for which is primarily viewing streaming video and some gaming. I could do with a little more battery life, a better way to vent the heat and more solid feet on the bottom and louder internal speakers. But again where this machine excels is the screen, it's bright, crisp and doesn't have excessively large bezels the addition of the S-pen makes this machine extremely versatile.","SAMSUNG 13.3"" Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, HD Intel Core I-5 Processor, Ultra Slim, US Warranty, Fiesta Red",1033,samsung
1957,Amazon Customer,2021,5,Love it despite flaws.,"* The left arrow key doesn't reliably connect unless I hit it much harder than I have to hit the other keys.* It's a roll of the dice whether the laptop shuts off or merely sleeps when I close the lid, which means when I re-open it I'm often faced with a full restart, and Chrome has to re-load all my tabs etc. This seems to reset brightness preferences: the screen starts up intolerably dim, for some reason.* Even worse, occasionally when I re-open the laptop it's in this weird state where it seems to think it's on, but the screen is completely black and I have to force a restart. This is both annoying and concerning.* The keyboard is technically backlit, but the light is so dim that it barely helps even when it's dark.* The trackpad is easily pushed down to click near its bottom, but gets increasingly difficult as you go up, which just feels really weird and inconsistent. More than 1/2 of the way up, it's too hard to press for me to practically want to.Despite all the flaws, I love this machine. It's super light. I like the feel of the construction. I like the color. I really like having the browser back/forward/refresh on the keyboard. The stylus, working with Android art programs I already knew and loved, has been a delight. It's really nice to be able to go right from typing an article to drawing illustrations for it on the same device. Being able to run android apps natively on a 2-in-1 is really cool (even though realistically I'd often be better off using the desktop versions of apps on a mac or windows machine -- for example, Slack and Discord do not provide a great experience running their android app in chromos, compared with the experience of their desktop applications on mac. And in other cases, like Webtoons, I'm realistically better off just visiting the webpage.

The quality in places is so high it feels 3D.The battery life leaves something to be desired. For me it is just over 3 hours. This can vary widely depending on what you are watching. When working on code in a terminal, the amoled showing black allows the battery to last a lot longer. The issue comes from trying to run a 4k screen, doing so requires a lot more computation which makes it all the more of a shame that 4k content is particularly scarce.The stylus works incredibly well, writing on this is a dream.I bought this for the amoled screen and chrome os and the issues with battery and 4k content are frustraiting but for me at least do not detract from how lovely the machine is to use.","SAMSUNG 13.3"" Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, HD Intel Core I-5 Processor, Ultra Slim, US Warranty, Fiesta Red",1033,samsung

Currently, Amazon is selling this for $799.99 ($200 less than I purchased the unit a week ago.) I work with Windoze and Mac professionally but at home, I enjoy using several Samsung tablets, the Chromebook Pro and other quality products from the company.I was really on the fence as I have a Samsung Pro from 2 years back and it does all that I need, Yet the lure of a better screen and CPU chip finally enticed me. I also welcome the Bluetooth 5 for earbuds and the lightness of the overall unit.As others have mentioned, the battery life when using the quality screen settings are a little below four hours, weak compared to the Asus Flip, with almost better specs- but the Flip doesn't have the quality screen this unit does. (I'm not carrying a charger with me when a battery pack will do the job.)The added functionality of Android apps, which are not always available with other brands, make this Galaxy a winner.

The keyboard travel and ""thud"" is satisfying and the trackpad is Apple level.Like every other review, the battery is abysmal compared to any ultrabook in 2020 (3-4 hours max with comfortable brightness). However, this is the best home laptop you can get right now. The design is hard to appreciate until it's in your hands, but I have never seen a thinner device with an i5 chip. It gets warm without a fan but nothing uncomfortable. The pen performs better than the gen 1 Apple Pencil I'm coming off of. I can't say this is great for art, but you get access to Concepts in the Play store and Adobe Draw. I do wish Samsung Notes was an option given the Galaxy name, but here we are. Big, big fan of using my mobile only fantasy football app (Sleeper) on a bigger screen. Most Android apps I've installed are responsive which helps to avoid going fullscreen/forced to use the touchscreen in portrait.Connecting a Dualshock4 controller was effortless, didn't need to configure for Among Us either. Some games like Shadowfall will need some effort to work. No CoD Mobile support was a bummer, hopefully in an update.Complaints: The screen looks great, however no 4k support on most streaming options AND due to the OLED this screen is very dim by default.

1968,Aitor,2021,5,Great Chromebook and Worth it,"I love this Chromebook. Very very well made. Excellent quality and sound. Great connections. Love the pen and the precision of the touchscreen. I do not like that I can't have the full desktop version of Firefox, but Chrome does a good job. Not all google play apps run smoothly some crash and it is almost impossible to run them. Google needs to work with the developers to make Chromebook specific apps, otherwise this is going to be trouble. I love that it has more than one thunderbolt connection. I have a ethernet to thunderbolt adapter and the internet goes twice as fast vs wifi and I have a premium mesh system, so this is great, because I am not a fan of wifi. The battery lasts some 4 - 5 hours, that is the only drawback. But the rest is great. I just use for personal basic apps. No fancy games here. But have not had any problems with running multiple apps.","SAMSUNG 13.3"" Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, HD Intel Core I-5 Processor, Ultra Slim, US Warranty, Fiesta Red",1033,samsung
1969,Mark,2022,3,Beautiful AMOLED Chromebook but Trackpad Freezing Up,"Having owned this Chromebook for over a year and using it primarily as a touch-screen tablet with a keyboard, I'm overall fairly satisfied.  The beautiful red solid aluminum body and stunning AMOLED touch-screen are the stars of this show.  Unfortunately, there's an unfortunate detraction in the form of the trackpad sometimes freezing up and I believe it's due to the machine running too hot.  Shutting the machine down and letting it cool down fixes the issue.  A more practical workaround is using a cooling pad or pairing a mouse to keep working when the trackpad isn't.  For my use case, I can live with the issue as I really enjoy viewing photographs or videos on such an amazing display but your mileage will vary.","SAMSUNG 13.3"" Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, HD Intel Core I-5 Processor, Ultra Slim, US Warranty, Fiesta Red",1033,samsung
1970,lholly,2021,3,Battery life not good,"I ordered chromebook for very light use, such as drawing out ideas for art projects and sometimes doing searches for materials and orders without having to be at my desk constantly. It is nice looking, I love the red, I liked that it is aluminum and not plastic. The touch screen isn't up to standards for me. When I am switching between apps swiping up seems to take a few attempts at least. Battery life is horrible! I get about 2 hours out of a full charge, sometimes 2 1/2 hours but never more. Other reviews mentioned the heat factor and that is correct. I decided to take the chance because the heat issue seemed to have mixed opinions but after using this for a little over a month,  the heat transferred from bottom is an issue. It gets VERY hot. No, it hasn't left burn marks on my skin but it gets hot enough to be very uncomfortable. Because of battery life and the heat issue I don't use it much unless I can set it on a small side table or sofa table which is about the same as having to sit at my desk and use my desktop PC. I would not buy this again.","SAMSUNG 13.3"" Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, HD Intel Core I-5 Processor, Ultra Slim, US Warranty, Fiesta Red",1033,samsung

I heard about the screen brightness, clarity, etc and that was not immediately the case for me.  It took a lot of research for me to figure out how to achieve all the magic tricks this little Chromebook has to offer.  It is a fantastic device at the end of the day.  Everything is made compact and you have to learn how it all works, if not familiar with the OS and the device itself.  From an aesthetic sense, it is gorgeous, small, thin, and the red is a must!

1973,Gotham Creatures,2022,2,Far less than what you pay for,"I was so frustrated trying to use this thing when I first got it that I ended up just not using it and using my work laptop instead. Over the past few months I would occasionally pull it out and after a few times I discovered the mouse touchpad would just completely stop responding. Touching the screen and then moving the mouse again seems like the only reliable method to get it fixed but it seems to have gotten worse and worse.I suspect this is  an issue with the touchpad itself, possibly just needs to be reconnected. The really annoying thing is that there isn't any advanced touchpad or stylus settings that makes it naively able to disable one or the other. Regardless, this was one of the most expensive chromebooks out there and in hindsight I wish I'd gotten the Lenovo that my wife ended up getting last month.Outside the 90 day return window so now I need to go through the hoops of talking with Samsung support to see if they'll cover it under warranty..","SAMSUNG 13.3"" Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, HD Intel Core I-5 Processor, Ultra Slim, US Warranty, Fiesta Red",1033,samsung

Starting at 96% I steamed a 44 minute episode from Netflix, read 3 articles with ads but no video with two tabs open and was left with 43% charge after 90 minutes. Then I closed all but one tab and left the laptop open and 'asleep' for 3 hours after which only 6% battery life remained. So 90% of battery life was drained in 4.5 hours with minimal to no usage.

1995,kelly giottonini,2015,5,"Excceptional, Practical, and Efficient Product. Impressive in all aspects-- thorough review",". Over the past year or two I came to realize that not only Chromebooks do almost everything a laptop or a PC or a tablet would do for me but they do it cheaper, usually faster and better, almost always worry-free and very much in style. I wrote 'almost' because, yes, not everything does everything even though the Chromebooks seem to be doing a lot and they are getting better - even run Microsoft Office these days (see note at the bottom).WHY A CHROMEBOOK AT ALL?There's so much to say here but let me make a quick summary. And never forget that we are talking about an 'around 300 dollars' device here because, yes, anything that costs 3-4-5 times as much should do SOMETHING better or very few of us would pay more for such devices.˕ My Chromebook is by far my most used computer excluding work hours and by 'computer' I mean PCs, laptops and tablets.˕ Malware, spyware, adware-free. Since nothing is really 'installed' on a Chromebook and not much is physically stored on it, it would be very hard for one to be infected. I am in fact now using my Chromebook to open suspicious emails or click on dubious URLs that I don't dare touch from a laptop.˕ Extremely safe OS. I don't know if this is common knowledge but Google is constantly challenging hackers to crack their OS. As far as I know, Chrome OS wasn't cracked yet.˕ Easy to share among any number of users without any concerns of compromising privacy. If you have a Google account, you simply sign in and you are going to be within your own, personal environment.˕ Constantly updated and upgraded. Google updates Chrome OS every few weeks and I found my Chromebooks actually getting better all the time rather than slowly fall into obsolescence.˕ Nearly maintenance free. Whenever I don't use a tablet or even a laptop for a while, they tend to get very busy once I turn them back on, downloading and installing various patches, updates and upgrades. Not the case for Chromebooks. Whatever upgrades may take place don't hit my Chromebook. Whenever I call up an app, I get it in its latest version.˕ The attached keyboard helps a lot. Yes, you can pair a keyboard and even a mouse to a tablet but the Chromebook's keyboard is always there, it negates the need of a stand or even some protecting case.˕ Chrome OS is streamlined and efficiently focused where it matters, on the everyday uses most of us need a 'computer' most of the time.˕ Chrome OS being such a streamlined one, browsing and running apps on a Chromebook is in fact faster than off a PC/laptop/tablet of equivalent specs.˕ Relatively low prince, 11.6"" display and light weight seem to be just about right for something that typically you'd be using to browse the Web while watching TV or take to and from school.WHY NOT A CHROMEBOOK?Yes, Chromebooks can't do everything. Google's productivity suites notwithstanding, Chromebooks are best at media consumption rather than production. Nobody should buy a Chromebook and expect to be able to edit video or do some hard-core gaming. There are other machines and devices for such tasks. My experience is that a Chromebook can't do 'everything'. Tablets are more portable, PCs and laptops are more powerful and versatile but, to me, my Chromebook is the most fun to use and it's likely to stay this way. I am not going to call it my 'second' or 'third' or 'first' computer but, objectively, it's the one I most use outside business hours if what we measure is 'hours'.MY SON's SAMSUNG's CHROMEBOOK 2 vs. MY HP's CHROMEBOOK 11From the start, it was a very familiar feeling. Samsung's is easily recognizable as a Chromebook (see video).This is how they compare:˕ USB-based charging. Yeah... it's proprietary on the Samsung vs. semi-proprietary on the HP. HP's USB-based charging allows the use of most off-the-shelf chargers so there's a lot less to worry. However, off-the-shelf chargers aren't as efficient as the HP-supplied one so, while I give HP's a slight advantage, both HP and Samsung's are better off when charged with the manufacturer-supplied charger.˕ Better quality display. When compared to Samsung's, HP's colors are sharper and brighter and you can view the screen from almost any angle left/right or up/down. This can be seen in the attached video but it's the difference is even sharper to notice with the naked eye.˕ Keyboard. As a touch typist I am comfortable with both but. On a blind test, I wasn't able to distinguish between the two. As the video shows, the size and the layout are very similar and so is the feel.˕ Style - see video. Again, a matter of preference. HP's glossy white is easier to wipe and clean but some may find Samsung's black more elegant. Both HPs and Samsungs come in other colors. They are both Okay as far as I can tell.˕ Ports. There are no USB 3.0 or HDMI ports on the HP's but you do find them on Samsung's. Speaking for myself, I never felt a need to output HDMI off my Chromebook, ever. I am occasionally using USB to plug in a mouse dongle or perhaps a speaker set. Regardless, USB 3.0 is nice to have.˕ Other hardware. Samsung's comes with double the RAM (4GB) and a much faster processor. This is a clear advantage, especially when running demanding apps such as spreadsheets.Overall, I am pleased with both. I am going to keep my relatively old (but oh so pretty) HP because its primary use is 'entertainment' as in Web browsing and playing media but my kid prefers Samsung because, as a college student, he can put the faster processor and the extra memory to good use.RATINGChromebook 2, while generally excellent, loses one star for the somewhat dull display and for breaking through the 300 dollar price barrier.I am not going to compare Samsung's Chromebook with the Pixel or some top of the line laptop. So, let me make a 'duh' statement: this Chromebook is not as good as devices that sell for 3 times or 4 times as much so anyone who doesn't mind paying more should pay more and get one of those. Even though... look at some reasons above for why one my prefer a Chromebook to a laptop or a tablet, regardless of price.Samsung's is at least as good and in some ways better than my now one year old, often used and much trusted HP Chromebook 11, even though I prefer HPs better display. As far as performance, Samsung beats HP when loading pages even though they both appear to be up to the task and they both played Netflix movies flawlessly over Wi-Fi and cast them to the big TV through Chromecast (no need of an HDMI cable for that) - I mention it because I just tried that. Samsung's Chromebook was able to easily and simultaneously play a movie on Netflix, a video on Youtube and a song on Pandora while I was checking my email and running a spreadsheet in the cloud without breaking a sweat. Not bad for such an inexpensive device. By the way, I had to cut that part from the attached video because it was too annoyingly noisy but I will try to redo it and attach it later.Chromebooks are not for everyone and they are not a universal computing device and Samsung's Chromebook 2 is a Chromebook through and through but, if used for what they are meant to be used, they are as good and as revolutionary as tablets._____________________________________________________NOTES:- Prior to ordering this Chromebook, I attended 'orientation' at our kid's college. The session with the IT director helped me decide to order it. I really wasn't sure what was good for him. He already has a rather large Windows 8 laptop but he doesn't want to take it to school because it's too large and heavy among other reasons. I asked the IT person if he was going to be Okay if he used a Chromebook and he said 'yes'. Then I asked the specific 'Microsoft apps' question: ""are there any 'Microsoft apps' that he may need and won't be able to run on his Chromebook?"" The IT person stated that all students are granted free Web access to Microsoft Office and that Chromebooks are fully supported.- Like most Chromebooks, this one too comes with a free 100GB in Google's cloud for two years. I didn't take advantage of that offer and I'm not going to go for this one, simply because I have no use of 'cloud' storage that goes beyond Gmail at this time.- While Chromebooks are immune to viruses and other forms of malware, you are as tracked and 'monetized' while on a Chromebook as you are when browsing from your laptop or tablet or phone. However, there are ways to disrupt and confuse the trackers and my two favorite extensions these days are Disconnect Search (or Disconnect.me) that makes it impossible for Google to log your search activities and DoNotTrackMe which does what the name implies. Worth trying.","Samsung Chromebook 2 11.6 Inch Laptop (Samsung Exynos, 4 GB, 16 GB SSD, Black)",49,samsung
1996,Jennifer Gladen,2022,3,Weird Material,"Because Chromebooks are so new and not widely used, invariably a review of this item has to be a review about the Chromebook OS as well as the machine itself.  I'll start with the OS.I have been intrigued by Chromebooks for a while but have been hesitant to try one because of their limitations.  Recently I needed to replace my laptop, but did not feel like plunking down a lot of cash for a new one.  I have a desktop PC with Windows 7 in good condition for running any special software that I may occasionally need, so I figured that if I ran into things the Chromebook could not handle I could always go back to my desktop for that.  As it turns out, I find myself going back to my desktop very rarely.  There are two programs -- an accounting program and an image processing program -- that I need to run on the desktop, and both of these I would prefer to use on the desktop anyway for the larger monitor.  For everything else the Chromebook not only does it, but does it faster and with less hassle.  If I need to send an email, upload some photos, check the news, or make a quick edit to a document, I can complete the task on my Chromebook in the time it would take my PC just to startup and become functional.  It starts up so quickly that I don't even think about it -- it is basically like opening a book.  The OS, from the user's point of view, is completely an afterthought.  You just switch on the machine and start working.  And you don't have to mess with anti-virus or anything like that.  It is such a worry- and hassle-free device that I can't believe they aren't more popular.  For anyone who dislikes doing PC maintenance or finds Windows confusing, this is definitely the system to go for.  When I first read reviews of Chrome, some said that if you wanted to experience Chrome, just maximize the Chrome browser in your PC and that was basically what it was like.  Not true (at least in the current version).  There are a number of apps built into the system (handy stuff like a calculator) and more that you can add on (nearly all for free) from the app store.  There is also a file manager for managing external storage devices as well as files stored in the machine's own solid state drive.  It is all very intuitive and easy to use.  I glanced through the help menus one time just to learn some shortcuts and such, but it was hardly necessary.  Once you get connected to the internet you will be off and running.  The system is also ideal for users who are using cloud-based apps like Google docs, Evernote, etc.  If you are not already using cloud-based apps, using a Chromebook will likely get you hooked on them.  You always have access to your files wherever you are, and you don't have to worry about losing because your computer crashed or something.So clearly I am sold on the OS.  How about the machine?  I was also pleasantly surprised with the quality of the machine, especially for the price.  It is very thin and lightweight, perfect for carrying around.  It is something you can slip into a briefcase or bookbag and hardly know it is in there.  My previous laptops all look massive in comparison.  I have seen some negative comments about the stitched styling of the top -- personally I think the texture looks and feels nice, and the stitching is reasonably subtle and not cheap looking.  It is not brushed aluminum or whatever, but you are not paying for brushed aluminum (nor should you in my opinion).  This is a machine that looks good and simple, and absolutely gets the job done.  The keyboard is pretty solid, although I am used to deeper keys (more like an external keyboard), and I love the simpler layout that the Chrome OS makes possible.  Huge track pad and very responsive.  I am not enough of a techie to comment on the technical specs really, but I would say that 4 gb ram seems like more than enough to be running a lightweight OS like this.  As for speed, as I mentioned above, everything I have done on this is lightning fast, including video streaming (HD) etc.  The monitor is about average -- I have no complaints about it except that I agree with some other reviewers that the viewing angle is not great, but for personal use it works well and I have watched lots of videos on it and done lots of reading at generally think it is a solid monitor for the price.  Speakers are average / typical for a laptop.  I have not clocked the battery runtime but it is off the charts compared to any laptop I have ever owned.  I don't even think about the battery, just charge it in if I happen to be near the power cable (sometimes only every couple of days depending on usage).  If you are used to a Windows PC I am sure it will be better than the runtime you have now.In conclusion, this is the laptop I always wished was possible.  It is inexpensive, requires no maintenance or software, and it does nearly everything you want very quickly.  Even if you are buying it just to use on the go, you will likely find that it quickly becomes your primary machine, even if you do need to go back to your Windows machine from time to time for a special application.","Samsung Chromebook 2 11.6 Inch Laptop (Samsung Exynos, 4 GB, 16 GB SSD, Black)",49,samsung
1997,Mr. K,2015,4,Great option for a tablet/laptop with an amazing price,"I’ve been using the Samsung Chromebook 2 for a few days and am ready to give some impressions.  I have been following the development of Chrome OS for a while now.  A year ago I pre-ordered the ASUS Chromebox, realizing it would be a good, cheap way to get to try out the OS, plus would fulfill the need for a second desktop computer (I already had a spare 24 inch monitor sitting around).  The OS was quite usable a year ago, and has seem some growth since that time, with bug fixes and added features such as the ability to download movies from Google Play to watch offline, and support for Microsoft Office documents has been improved.  There is a good selection of apps that will run offline and all your Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides are stored locally as well as on Google Drive.  When online the browser can be set to respond to “OK Google,” just like on Android.  No matter what Chrome OS device you pick, study the Help file in detail so that you understand the OS’s quirks (like how to right click!).I like to buy locally if possible, so I checked out a couple of stores.  Just based on style the Samsung was the clear leader.  Locally the stores had the silver Intel CPU model, and I got to check it out fairly thoroughly and thought it would do what I wanted.  I went home to compare specs and read reviews, and that’s when I learned about the black model with 4GB of RAM and the Exynos processor here on Amazon.  My ASUS performs OK with 2 GB so I figured that a 4GB model would be a good choice, although I wasn’t sure how the ARM processor would affect performance.  Several professional reviews that I read complained that the Exynos was a bit laggy compared with the Intel processors, but they were really pushing it hard in their tests, which is exactly what I would expect a pro reviewer to do.  Based on reviews on Amazon by actual users, I decided the Exynos version would be OK, and I really liked the looks of the black model.I’ve tried to test every possible feature of the Chromebook 2 in the past few days.  No need to comment on the excellent keyboard and trackpad, as that has been well covered.  As far as speed, I think it is OK.  Not the fastest laptop by any means, but is adequate for light computing and document processing.  YouTube videos run just fine, and I have used Chrome Remote Desktop with good results.  Responsiveness for document processing is pretty good, with just an occasional keystroke lag.  Audio both ways seems to be fine on Google Hangouts.  One thing that isn’t addressed on the Samsung web site is the design of the headphone jack.  In fact, it is a four conductor connection that supports both microphone in and stereo audio out, so you can plug in an earbud/mic combo of the type used with mobile phones.  The Chromebook connects with our Chromecast just fine.I don’t have any issue with the screen and, in fact, I'm pretty well pleased with it..  It’s plenty contrasty for me, and you can dial it up to “torch mode” if you want.  A computer is useless if you can’t do I/O, so a good keyboard, trackpad, and screen go a long way toward keeping the user happy in my opinion.  If you keep the screen turned down the battery life goes up.  Speaking of battery life, of course it varies with what you’re doing and screen brightness, but it appears that eight hours is an honest number for average use.  UPDATE: After another week of use I'd say that seven hours of battery life is a good, real-world number.The HDMI connection works just fine, and I’ve tested it both directly to our television receiver and with an HDMI-to-VGA adapter to a projector.  By the way, the HDMI port powered the adapter just fine and didn’t require external power from a USB port.  I bought a Class 10, 32GB Sandisk microSD card from Amazon for about $15 and discovered two things I had not expected: The default download location can be pointed to the SD card, thus saving space on the SSD, and the Sandisk card comes with a full size adapter, so I could put it in the full-size slot on any of my other computers to transfer files if needed, or could actually use it in a camera if I wanted.  By the way, speaking of cameras Polarr appears to be a good, offline-capable app that emulates Lightroom and will process RAW files.One last thing, another reviewer suggested getting the AmazonBasics 11.6-Inch Laptop Sleeve to go with this Chromebook.  I did that and it is a snug but good fit.  You need to stretch it a bit when pulling the zipper over the corners, but it is a nice, padded case for the price.Overall, if I could give fractional stars, I'd rate the Samsung Chromebook 2 with Exynos processor about a 4.6.  It does what it is supposed to quite well and has an interface that is easy to live with.","Samsung Chromebook 2 11.6 Inch Laptop (Samsung Exynos, 4 GB, 16 GB SSD, Black)",49,samsung
1998,Lon J. Seidman,2014,4,Everything is excellent except the screen,"Love it! New chromebook user, soon to be college student, and love this samsung. I go to a school where 90% of the kids have macs, but I'm very happy with choosing this chromebook.  I was almost sold on getting a 2nd gen refurbished Macbook pro for around $600, but then chose this chromebook because my buddy told me about how pleased he is with his. Not only is this cheaper (about $380 after getting protection plan, which I would highly recommend because even though the laptop is well put together, it is very thin, light and has a plastic body which I could foresee breaking with a good drop) but I actually prefer this over having a ""real"" laptop. Aside from Aesthetics, which apple is the premium, I don't think it can get much better than this for your average tech using student. The small, compact, and light body is very convenient, and I have nothing to complain about in regards to the keyboard and touch pad which are all up to par. The only things I'd mention about the keyboard is that there is no Caps Lock key and I'm not sure if there is a way around it, but I also haven't really looked into it because it's not a huge concern of mine. Furthermore, the keys aren't lighted but I think this is pretty over rated because the screen provides lighting if you're in the dark.  I got the Black model and, again, nothing to complain about in terms of how it looks. The faux leather top isn't too flashy where it looks tacky, and I'm not overly crazy about it but it is different and looks nice in a subtle way. I wouldn't let this play too big of a factor if your'e thinking about getting this because if you aren't a fan of it I'm sure there are clip on cases to cover it. It's very thin and light which I like, but also doesn't feel overly plastic and cheap, but again it is far from the feel of a macbook body. The speakers are located on the bottom but deliver; I wasn't sure what to expect with the audio but the sound is clear and pretty loud coming from the speakers(louder and nicer than most laptops, mac included)  Now, what I think is most important when thinking about purchasing a laptop--the actual performance. This thing is FAST. My wifi at my house is pretty strong, but with xbox live running, a laptop, a desktop, and a handful of smartphones all using the same network, it definitely slows down and is disappointing at times. The laptop shared by my family is a couple years old, and a little dated, but is by no mean a bad machine and sometimes when browsing the internet or trying to load videos it is frustratingly slow, and my iphone has its stuttering moments, but with this samsung chromebook it has performed exceptionally on my home's wifi network. It hasn't taken more than a second or two for any webpage to load even with multiple tabs and spotify running in the background. Also I'm a big fan of google play store on the device because you now have so many apps and useful programs at your disposal. Google docs also offers all the average consumer needs in microsoft office, and it's for free. I haven't yet run into an incompatible program or website. The screen is also satisfactory. I have not used it yet outside on a bright sunny day, but it seems that the brightness (which is easily adjusted with keys on the board) gets bright enough so lighting isn't an issue. The resolution is very clear and suits all I need perfectly (clear enough for good res videos and regular use) but if you're expecting a premium, high def, top of the market picture you aren't gunna get it. The chromebook also runs silently--I haven't heard a fan kick in yet--, boots up super quick, and wakes up from sleep instantly and without any lag. The battery life is amazing. I opened it out of the box, hooked it up to the charger(long chord, generic with box thingy on chord), and it booted right up for me to easily sync my gmail account.  Overall; I HIGHLY RECOMMEND a chromebook. Whether it be this model or a different one, I truly believe these are the best options for your money on the market right now. I was scared that I wasn't going to be getting a ""full"" laptop, or miss out on features that a chromebook possibly couldn't offer, but I was wrong. For the average tech user/consumer/student I would recommend a chromebook 10 times out of 10 and this Samsung  is impressive on all levels!","Samsung Chromebook 2 11.6 Inch Laptop (Samsung Exynos, 4 GB, 16 GB SSD, Black)",49,samsung

2000,Arturo,2022,4,Had a few flaws but does the job,"This is a solid Chromebook.Pros:- Battery life is good, usually get 6-8 hours of use between charges- Size and weight, small but plenty big enough to browse the interwebs effectively. Also very light.- Simple user interfaceCons:- Biggest problem is with Chrome OS, crashes frequently. Not really sure what the problem is. I'm not doing anything other then surfing web or watching YouTube videos. Crashes at least 2-3 times during a nightly use session. Really frustrating.- Build quality, a few small drops and there are a few cracks in the frame around the screen and dents on the frame. I know these products aren't intended to be dropped but drops that happened weren't really hard and I was surprised the Chromeback has such damage. Not a huge problem, has not affected performace.- I have a lot of bookmarks and links saved in my Chrome. Sometimes it is slow to open up my bookmarks. Also sometimes browsing the other apps in the Chromebook can be slow. Also loading webpages is sometimes slow but that is more to do with the internet speed.- Some times laggy when surfing or using apps. Could use a bit more RAM to be more effective but you get what you pay for.Overall:I really love this Chromebook and will be buying the 3rd version. For the few problems I've had it has been an absolute pleasure to own. It's small size is great for travelling and still being able to take your laptop with you. It can do what you need for word process, excel type documents and PDF's. It's a really useful item if you don't want a tablet. There are a lot of more expensive competitors especially with the introduction of the tablet/laptops like the Surface Pro 4 and Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro but those are full blown operating systems and are priced starting at $1000 bucks. This Chromebook costing so little and still being able to compete is a no brainer for me. I highly recommend it to everyone whose looking for a new laptop or tablet.Come on Samsung bring out the Chromebook 3 already I'm ready to upgrade.","Samsung Chromebook 2 11.6 Inch Laptop (Samsung Exynos, 4 GB, 16 GB SSD, Black)",49,samsung

2002,Amazon Customer,2015,3,This particular model is ho-hum.,"I love and hate this particular Chromebook.  I enjoyed not having to buy an anti-virus program for this OS, as it is installed into the browser.  I also enjoyed using Google's proprietary apps which I found to be better than Microsoft's original versions, and anything I normally do on the internet worked just fine here.  I was unhappy with all the online apps offered in the Chrome Store.  Many are subpar at best.  I also understood at the time I purchased the unit that Chrome Store would be offering more apps that were already available on the Android platform but to date, there's only a handful.  Even with the Android platform coming to Chromebook, this particular model is not getting the update due to it being a non-Intel model.  This Chromebook constantly disconnects from Bluetooth and Wifi.____________________________________________________________________________(old review)I recently got rid of my Windows laptop and decided to try a Chromebook.  My PC habits have changed over the years and with all the applications now available via the cloud, I thought the Chromebook would be a nice, affordable change.  I've been working with Google apps for quite a while on my other PC and tablet and thought I'd give the cloud world a 100% green light.  I've been working with it for 2 months and I'm liking it so far.This particular Chromebook 2 by Samsung is very nice.  I do feel like I have a sturdy product in hand.  I love the fact that when I open it up, it automatically turns on and I can log into my work space in seconds.  I gave this product 4 out of 5 stars because the typing keys already look slightly worn with only 2 months of use, and I'm only on it about an hour a day and not even typing much at that.  However, I have no reason to believe the keys will short out or give up before the life of the product itself.","Samsung Chromebook 2 11.6 Inch Laptop (Samsung Exynos, 4 GB, 16 GB SSD, Black)",49,samsung

2004,BerkeleyBear,2015,5,I love chromebooks now and wish I could give one to everyone I know lol,"I wouldn't even know where to begin with how much I love this chromebook. After several charges, I now get about 5-6 hours of battery life until I need to charge it again. Though, I do recall having up to 8 hours of battery life in the beginning. Going from a heavy/huge laptop (Toshiba Satellite) to this one felt amazing. I love google products and the switch to solely using google drive was natural. Now there is microsoft versions of word, excel, powerpoint, etc. that you can use if you do not like google docs, spreadsheet and slides. I love how light it is, the size is perfect for me as a student since it is not too tiny nor too big for college desks, and the speed in turning on and off. The ONE downside I have with this since I love just about everything about it is that I have issues with printing. You should check to see if your printer is ""cloud-ready"" because if it isn't then you need to use another computer in order to do the cloud printing. Basically what this means is that I find the file on the chromebook, do the print set up and press print, then go to my old laptop and open it up and log in. As soon as you wake up the laptop that has the cloud-ready printing on it, the printer will begin to print. It is not too much of a hassle but I am thinking of just selling my old laptop and this printer (even though it is relatively new) and just buying a cloud-ready printer. I had also bought a tablet not long after (Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 7.0) getting this but ended up selling it because I really had no use for it (I bought it for school but thought this was much more handy so it ended up being just for games). Any of your considering getting a tablet, just get this and try it because it is awesome and is much more practical than a tablet. You won't have to buy extra accessories aside from maybe a case and or screen protector since it already has everything you need.","Samsung Chromebook 2 11.6 Inch Laptop (Samsung Exynos, 4 GB, 16 GB SSD, Black)",49,samsung
2005,JayKruz_90,2014,4,I could have easily gotten a refund after I found this out but ...,"I bought this computer because I had to put my macbook pro in the shop for a fan replacement and I attend a school where we use our computers everyday. I wanted something that I could use temporally and at a decent price. First off this computer doesn't work for my school because two programs that we use for class does not run on chrome. I could have easily gotten a refund after I found this out but I fell in love with this computer the minute I took it out of the box.First, I love the size of this computer it's very lightweight and the screen is perfect, even though it is an 11 inch its not too small. All you need is a wifi connection and you're good to go, you can save documents, transfer your music and videos, etc. I'm keeping this computer because it's easier to carry around then my 15 inch macbook pro. I can just sit it on my lap and tap away. My only complaint is that this computer is not compatible with software that isn't made by google, I get that this is why it is called chrome book. I understand not running the same programs as apple or micro soft but programs used by schools should be able to run on a chrome book, if they were a lot more people would have them.So if you're thinking about getting this for school but your school use programs like Repondus or Graph Pad or anything similar, then this can't be your main computer, its good for a backup or recreational use.

2006,irisch,2014,3,Looks and feel good but not so sure about performance.,"I don't write many reviews but I felt I should write one on this Chromebook 2.First, let me say I am not new to the Chromebook. I purchased one back in 2012 it was a Samsung and at the time it first came out I forked out $450.00 for it but my wife loved it and used it everyday since the day I bought it. Well, she got her new one yesterday and it took me less then 5 minutes to set it up.Now the look and feel of the new one is much better then the old Chromebook, not saying the old one was that bad. That was the plus side now for the performance. My wife like to watch one soap opera, which she watches everyday. On her old Chromebook it ran great, but on the new one it would pause, skip, and jerk. Now the new unit has 2 gig more memory and a better processor so I didn't expect this.Well, I went on the help forum for the Google Chrome and tried a few things, like turning off extensions and logging on as guest, it helped some but it still runs slower then the old one.My wife is going to give it a couple of days and decide if she wants to send it back. This is why I am only giving it three stars.I also have to be honest with you the soap she watches is on ABC and they don't do videos very well. I try videos from youtube and they work much better. I just feel the overall performance is not as good as the older Chromebook. By the way you can find the old one much cheaper. I missed out on buying one a deal of the day for $85.How this review will help with your decision making.","Samsung Chromebook 2 11.6 Inch Laptop (Samsung Exynos, 4 GB, 16 GB SSD, Black)",49,samsung
2007,Late Adopter,2014,5,"So far so, so good! Fast, simple, polished.","Just came, today. Very easy to set up (including getting Hebrew to work, which I need). Very fast to both boot up and come out of sleep. I'm used to using Macbooks and this is obviously not quite as versatile and polished, but it's actually kind of close in the physical experience -- ie, the keyboard and the touchpad are comparable (and that's high praise for a machine that's maybe a third of the price).Just starting to try the offline capacity, but Google Docs -- the main software I use -- seems to work well offline. Streams Netflix and Hulu well.Starting to notice some things it _can't_ do. The pdf reading capacity is nothing close to what you get with Mac's Preview -- no ability to annotate or edit pdfs (maybe someone will come out with a good app for that like iAnnotate on the iPad). In a more 'critical mission' department, some banking/utility company software doesn't work with the Chrome browser . . . . and with a _Chromebook_, you can't just switch to MS Explorer or Safari or something to see if it works better.Bottom line, it seems like an extraordinary machine for the price, especially if you have (like me) already moved just about everything you do into the cloud (only maybe 8gig of usable hard disk space here).  . . . With the small storage space and the limited software options it feels to me a little bit like something in between a tablet and a full-service computer. But, as with tablets, you seem to get something in return for sacrificing some functionality -- lightening fast performance at what it does do, especially in terms of being almost instantly available from sleep.Great option if you don't need a ton of hard disk space for videos and such and you're not trying to do image editing or desktop publishing.","Samsung Chromebook 2 11.6 Inch Laptop (Samsung Exynos, 4 GB, 16 GB SSD, Black)",49,samsung
2008,Jason,2014,3,Disappointed / annoyed,"I was really excited for this chromebook after using my wife's acer base model for a few weeks, however, I have been pretty disappointed.  First issue: uploading photos from an external hard drive.  Google drive and/or this computer can't handle my 8GB upload of photos, and it keeps crashing or simply cutting the upload off around 2000 files.  Next, the file manager is poor.  I can't delete files from my external HD via the file manager, and I also am unable to see summary statistics for any folder in my google drive (total space, file count, etc.).Next: display issues.  I've hooked up my computer to the TV and it can't mirror screens.  On top of that, the HDMI connection is fragile and crashes chrome browser sometimes or loses the mouse.Next: screenshot problems.  About 50% of the time, my screenshots fail and I have to redo them.Next: media playback.  the standalone video player wouldn't read the video portion of my mkv file.  i'm sure it's a codec issue, but annoying nonetheless.I was swayed by some of the reviews for this product that insisted, yes, even though this is mostly a cloud machine, it is just as good as a real computer.  I see where they're coming from.  If these things worked, I'd be inclined to agree, but as it stands, this is a far inferior product to what I was expecting, and inferior even to the Acer $200 model my wife has, even with the extra computing power.  I wish I had purchased that one and pocketed the extra $100.Be warned.","Samsung Chromebook 2 11.6 Inch Laptop (Samsung Exynos, 4 GB, 16 GB SSD, Black)",49,samsung
2009,Kelly,2014,5,It is great for what it is advertised for - internet,"This is growing on me.  It is great for what it is advertised for - internet, email, basic surfing.  It supports my candy crush addiction.  It boots up quickly and has great battery life.  Keyboard is a great size. It doesn't get super hot and it has already survived a few drops from a 2-3 foot high table onto carpeted floor that sits next to my recliner.  That being said, it supports a limited number of video codecs so if you want to watch videos on it offline there is a good chance it won't play.  You can do a side boot to ubuntu through the crouton? ""app"" but since this is an ARM based machine, options are limited in Ubuntu.  I could not get flash working in Ubuntu and my videos wouldn't play there either.  I'm not really sold on the fake leather external casing but that isn't really a deal breaker either.  If I had done my research prior to my impulse buy I would have known about the limitations and probably wouldn't have bought it.  I would, however, recommend this for parents or siblings or those who aren't technologically savvy.  This would be great for my parents who used to turn the computer off by flipping the power switch because they would forget how to do it through a windows start ""bar:.  It would also be great for people who ""click on every link"" and download malware with every link they open.

2010,Steven Williams,2015,1,"Missing too many features to be a good laptop or internet device, get an Asus or an iPad","I just wanted a cheap laptop, so I thought I'd give ChromeOS a chance.  After using it for a year I wish I'd spent the extra 100$ for a refurbished Macbook or an Asus instead.  Every month or so I try to accomplish some seemingly common task, only to find that there is no way to do it on ChromeOS.  When you count in the amount of time spent trying to find workarounds (if they even exist) the price tag on this ""bargain"" laptop increases pretty rapidly.  I am a highly technical person, so this list is not compiled in ignorance.  Overall feels like Google just wanted you to do things The Google Way.  Linux, Windows, and Mac all have much bigger developer communities so pretty much any task you want to accomplish is possible, not so with ChromeOS.  If you really just want an internet machine get an iPad, better battery life and apps that don't suck.Tasks that suck  SSH.  You can use the developer shell, but it is a pain to use private key files, set up tunnels, or anything else that one would expect. Also with a tiny resolution your window is limited to being 100 characters wide or so, even on a massive external display.  Torrents. JSTorrent sorta works, but its frustrating and slow.  Downloaded Files.  Google doesn't like offline files, cause they can't monetize your usage of them.  Any downloaded file can randomly be deleted.  Netflix is slow, sometimes audio is distorted. Also limited to 720p output.  Granted, Chrome on ANY platform is limited to 720p, but even Internet Explorer can do 1080p.  Flash is broken.  Not that common anymore but still frustrating.Features Missing (ZERO workarounds)  Cannot zoom/pan images downloaded from the internet.  Good luck if your vacation photos are larger than the tiny screen.  When connected to external display, turning off said monitor puts it to sleep.  KeepAwake doesn't work, despite what people say.  Tried to use my chromebook to browse the internet on my TV from the couch with a wireless keyboard, but turning off the TV would turn off the chromebook.  No way to SCP files to/from remote server  Hangouts doesn't work properly, sound is distorted, video is unusable even on high-speed connection.","Samsung Chromebook 2 11.6 Inch Laptop (Samsung Exynos, 4 GB, 16 GB SSD, Black)",49,samsung

2014,Trevor Allen,2014,5,(y) <--- On Facebook that translates to thumbs up.,"Excellent Chromebook. Bought this when my samsung chromebook 2 order on Samsung.com went on back-order and got this guy from amazon. Everything is great about this machine which i'm writing this review on, however the seal for the device did come broken. I know it says dont accept if the seal is broken however i opened it and nothing was out of place. The device is a great performer, and the octa core really gives it that extra power to do a great job. Screen is pretty good in terms of quality. Great for my online summer school and chrome is a very robust browser for anything on the web. Literally boots in about 5-10 secs and logs in easily. WiFi chip is excellent and battery life is amazing. Charges extremely fast however it also lasts a long time. Really takes a good media beating without killing the battery too much. It was also great to go to the samsung booth and pull out a product they still have yet to release in stores for months. Also design kills all Chromebooks below it except for the 13 inch chromebook 2. I wish the webcam was better though. Overall great device and very powerful. great screen, battery life, design, speed, and the size. Easily slips into any backpack pocket.

I have the Samsung Chromebook XE303C12 and although it still works great, this ""Chromebook 2"" has simply overshadowed. The performance is superior, no lags whatsoever, and always ready with an immediate response.The keyboard is much more comfortable, but the best is the trackpad, and I wish my Windows laptop had a trackpad as comfortable and precise like the one with the Samsung Chromebook 2.The faux leather finish, is not at all cheap, makes the device look even more attractive and stylish. I'm still regretting not having bought version 13.3"" to take advantage of the full HD instead of 720p, but as I read on reviews, have been observed performance problems in version 13.3"" that does NOT exist in version 11.6 ""If you are like me who spends hours on the web, checking email, social networking, researching and taking online courses, this is the machine you need.If you also need to create or revise documents, spreadsheets, presentations, this machine must be in consideration.If you spend hours doing streaming of music from Spotify or Google Play or Rdio, movies from Netflix and TV shows from Hulu, or has a media server (or NAS) with PLEX .... this definitely is the device that you are looking for.","Samsung Chromebook 2 11.6 Inch Laptop (Samsung Exynos, 4 GB, 16 GB SSD, Black)",49,samsung

As a frequent business traveler, I didn't want to lug a thousand dollar MacBook Air around in my briefcase, I would constantly be thinking about its safety. I bought this for under $300, so I can just slip it in my bag and forget about it. It boots up instantly, lasts for at least 8 hours of moderate use, has a matte screen which does not reflect sunlight, and uses an excellent keyboard. I am somewhat limited by Chrome, such as using Google docs vs Microsoft word and online photo editors such as Pixlr instead of Photoshop. But if those are my only compromises, I think this is a great deal. I don't even have to bring the power brick with me when traveling, since the laptop holds its charge for up to 3 days while I'm on the road.

This is obviously amazingly fast, great battery, allows me to do everything I want once I got used to it and got all the extensions and such.  I got an external hard drive to keep all my historical photos and files.  Synched up all my files I want to have access to on google drive to have them in the cloud.One thing I didn't like quite so much was that the screen isn't super high res, so videos look good, but not great.  When at home I connect to a second screen, so it's not a problem, but on the road it's not perfect.  I wanted to the smaller size though, so I guess it was a tradeoff as I've heard the 13 inch has a really nice screen.Overall, I love the simplicity and it does what I want to do very very well at a very very good price.","Samsung Chromebook 2 11.6 Inch Laptop (Samsung Exynos, 4 GB, 16 GB SSD, Black)",49,samsung

My other devices were connected properly, but the Chromebook wouldn't.  I shut off the Chromebook and then turned it back on, and it connected just fine.  Update: About 2 years and one month after purchase, the Chromebook stopped working properly. It ran pretty well up until it just didn't. It would restart on it's own after about a minute of use. It still started up quickly, but I coudn't figure out how to get the restarting to stop. For the price, it wasn't worth trying to get someone to fix the issue.

We also have a Macbook for offline functionality like Word, Photoshop, etc., but our Chromebook 2 is used just as much if not more than the Macbook.  I also love that the Chromebook 2 allows multiple users to be logged in at the same time so we can just switch between them and not accidentally close or delete another person's work.

It stopped working, so I sent it to Acer for warrenty repair. It now works for about 2 days and I have to open the case and move wires around to get it going. So, I decided against buying another Acer. I read the reviews and thought this chromebook would be considerably better for $300. I only use the Chromebooks for browsing so speed and sound were most important to me.The sound is much better on the Samsung (speakers or headset), speed for the Samsung (4g memory) is no faster than the Acer (2G memory), and screen on the Samsung is a little darker.

My kids won't make the change since they like to play games, but I will soon be buying another one for me to upgrade from my tablet.  I decided to start minimalizing our heavy computer needs and for the past 2 years I have only used a tablet, except for a few instances that it wouldn't work.  I bought one of the original chromebox's and it still works flawlessly with my bedroom TV so I have no doubt the Chromebook will still be viable for years...

2042,Michael A. F. Dalton,2021,5,Maybe one of the best laptops ever made for Chromebook users?,"This is a review that I am going to try to keep brief, but I might fail. Here's why: The Samsung Galaxy Chromebook has had some of the most unfair reviews I have ever read about an inanimate object, and I'd like to clear the air of some of those comments.Let's start with the only thing I agree with from so many negative reviews, and that agreement is 'somewhat' at best, and that's the fact that the battery life is not all that great. Some would say it is terrible, I would say that is true if only going by specs alone. But, in real-life usage by a couch potato like myself, is a minor inconvenience. Why? Well, because I do not use my Chromebook in a manner that requires I run on battery power more than 3 or four hours at a time. If after something between 3 and 5 hours, I get low on battery I do what I have always done... I plug it in! I am not being silly, but serious. I plug it in and keep going for a while, then I unplug it and keep going some more.YES, I could not do that in the forest, at the beach, or on a long flight. But my use case does not require that any longer, like it did when I was an executive in the computer business, taking long flights.SO, if your use case or use model allows plugging in now and then, and 3-plus hours will get you what you need and you can plugin for a while at that point, THAT is what real-world usage is like for many many users of this machine.Next, and last, on the agreed-to complaints list of other reviews is that, yes, the machine does heat up sometimes, but no differently than does my $3500 Apple MacBook Pro every now and then. There isn't a lot to say about that, other than it is not constant nor always-so but does occur about as often and gets about as warm, as my Mac laptops have occasionally become.These two main points are in agreement with similar points on other reviews. But many, if not most, of the other points on clearly negative reviews, are less than objective or real-world, in my opinion.For example, I read a review that said the glass screen was so thin if was prone to break, and that the trackpad was just too small, that the hinges were terrible, that the keyboard was terrible, and on and on. All of which is categorically false, and is not a realistic appraisal of the machine, especially when compared with other very high-end laptops, such as some Apple models, some other high-end Chromebooks such as those from Samsung and Google's own offerings.Now... for the sweet sauce, the good points about this amazingly cool little machine... read on.This machine is thin... really thin. So much so, that for the 1st few days I found myself handling it like the newborn baby it was, but soon I reverted to treating it like a laptop computer. All to say this thing is built really well, AND that it is a top-tier piece of precision electronics like a high-end camera or sophisticated medical device. But while it is not unduly delicate, it does deserve a degree of understanding that it is not a 1-inch thick block of ABS plastic, so use and treat it accordingly.Next, the hinges, no complaints from me. Some reviewers claim they are lousy because the lid/screen will oscillate a bit when adjusted. True. And so does every really thin lid machine I have ever owned. Bu tin the real world, we don't do that, do we? We adjust the screen position and carefully, and it stays put.Next, the keyboard, it is every bit as good, and perhaps better than the keys on any Mac portable I've used for the past 5 plus years, in fact, I think it is a little bit better because the key-travel feels a little bit longer, which can make for better feedback and improved speed.No need to comment on the display, it's simply about as good as it can be. Literally. I don't think you can get a better screen on any laptop today. And many of the reviewers panned the machine because of a lack of 4K video material to consume. Someone should tell them it isn't the machine's issue, is it?Sound. The sound is fine, again, consider what you just purchased, it is not a Bose foldback bass design with an array of 6 drivers for sound. It is an amazingly thin laptop, and it sounds just fine. Does it get loud enough? Yes. Does it get really really really loud? No.The hinges are fine, too. My only complaint is that when fully opened into tablet-style, the lid doesn't lock into place, and my copy floated about 1/8th of an inch above the base unit when handheld at an angle. When in tablet configuration and laying flat, as on a desk or table, the lid was flush as it should be. A little annoying at most.All the great features you've read about are absolutely true of this machine. It is simply the best laptop I have ever owned. In terms of the build detail, it meets, and actually, IMPO surpasses, many if not all major laptop manufacturers' latest designs, especially in the Chromebook marketplace, where this machine may be the best, again, depending on your individual feature, functions, and use-case needs.Performance-wise the included i5 10th generation Clearlake U chipset seems to me to outperform or minimally to keep up with my 2015 Google Pixel Chromebook which used an i7 2.6Ghz processor married to 16GB of RAM. This machine I am reviewing has a chip that moves along at 1.6Ghz and throttles up to 3.9 (some spec sheets rate it above 4.x Ghz) and as such I have had zero performance issues even though it has 8 GB of RAM. So performance-wise, I am very pleased.Would I have been happy if I'd spent $1,000 (actually $999) on this machine? Well, my 2015 machined aluminum, best of breed, Google Pixel Chromebook (the second release in that brand/line) cost me over $1,200 when new, and I never looked back. This machine was discounted to $799 a year ago, and now that it is replaced with the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2, this original Galaxy Chromebook can be had for $599 new while inventory supplies are available. At that price, I would replace it in a micro-second if mine was damaged or lost.Those of us who have been Chromium OS and Chromebook pioneers have been rewarded with an ever increase of Chromebook capabilities in both the hardware and the apps and operating system. This machine, the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook (original version) is a real winner in every way, and while battery life is not top-of-class, this reviewer asserts that pretty much everything else is, and for $600, I am very happy with my purchase.I hope this review has been helpful, regardless of what you end up purchasing when shopping for your next Chromebook computer.","SAMSUNG 13.3” Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM,4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, Ultra Slim Design, Chrome OS, WiFi 6, Mercury Gray",859,samsung

2044,'grat,2022,3,Very nice chromebook with a problem,"For features, function, appearance, weight, and even price, it's hard to beat the Galaxy Chromebook.  Battery life is somewhat limited, but it makes up for it with a beautiful touch-screen, decent sound, and a (relatively) lightweight package.But Samsung has a serious quality-control issue going on.  I understand that things happen, and I don't expect every piece of electronics to be perfect-- however, when my first Galaxy Chromebook arrived, and it immediately sprang to life, the screen remained dark.  Multiple resets later, the screen still never even flickered.  No backlighting, and no apparent activity on the screen.  After contacting Amazon, who referred me to Samsung, Samsung came to the conclusion I had-- the screen wasn't connected internally.  Samsung suggested an Amazon replacement would be better than sending it to Samsung and waiting for the usual service turnaround, so I contacted Amazon, and arranged for a replacement.Two days later, the replacement shows up (both brand new, by the way-- no refurbs), and while the screen lights up in all it's glory, the battery charge indicator continues blinking.  The system will not charge.  The task bar doesn't show a battery AT ALL.  Open crosh with ctrl-alt-t, run 'battery_firmware info', and I'm told there is no battery.  *sigh*At this point, I've received two dead systems, and the project I bought it for has a time component.  Out of desperation, I did some investigation, and determined that removing the bottom cover is actually pretty easy, as was locating the connector for the battery.  A light press on the connector, followed by a noticeable click, and the system now has a functional battery.  The connector has a piece of clear yellow tape on top, suggesting Samsung knows this is a weak point.Basic quality control should include verifying the screen works, the charger works, and the battery works.  Obviously, neither Chromebook I received passed all three of these tests.This is a very nice piece of equipment, totally let down by a rushed production line.","SAMSUNG 13.3” Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM,4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, Ultra Slim Design, Chrome OS, WiFi 6, Mercury Gray",859,samsung

2046,Amazon Customer,2022,5,overall. a great device,"where would you get a laptop / chromebook with  4K UHD AMOLED touch screen, core i5. 256 ssd nvme storage and a great build quality weighing 2.29 pounds / 1.07 Kg for $568-$700 ?!.  A portable Amoled 13.3 inch monitor would probably cost around $700-1000 ! .  Yes the battery life is not great - about 4.5 -5 hours -  but I would not sit  that long on a single charge anyways and if I do I would plug it in or use a portable power bank.  What surprised me was  how good Chrome OS is, using it for the first time.  I think Chrome OS should be a mainstream operating system and windows 10/11 should be for an office environment.  On Chrome OS I use microsoft office , outlook, word and Excel downloaded from chrome web store, but most of the time I use it for reading , web browsing and youtube - and this is where the 4K Amoled is great.  Netflix should have a better arrangement with  Google / Chrome OS and should stream 4K videos and not just FHD 108P.","SAMSUNG 13.3” Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM,4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, Ultra Slim Design, Chrome OS, WiFi 6, Mercury Gray",859,samsung
2047,Joel C.,2021,5,"Amazing build, top quality in everything!","I have like 5 days with my Chromebook and I have to say I replaced a brand new Lenovo Duet from March 2021 so, it was my first trial with ChromeOS and I loved it! Besides the OS, eventough Lenovo's equipment is a terrific equipment and value for the price and performs well for its segment, I wanted something more powerful because I use 70% for work and 30% personal matter. And I'm using my Samsung instead my work's Dell Latitude with latest core i7 vPro 16 GB RAM, the issue is portability and it uses 70% if its power in security stuff loaded by my company. And I gotta say Samsung Galaxy Chromebook performs waaay better.Everything in it it's perfect and as many almost all know, battery is an ""issue"" because does to last as long as regular Chromebooks but man, consider, the amazing 13.3 in 4K AMOLED screen takes its part of the juice, also the i5 processor if you demand for power but at the end, nothing to worry about if you reduce screen brigthness and have moderate usage. I was concerned about that but know I realize it is not the issue many say.I know I just jumped from top of bottom segment to top of top and belive me, once you do, there's no turning back. Fortunately there's a lot of more affordable options with great specs and just little more dimensions.","SAMSUNG 13.3” Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM,4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, Ultra Slim Design, Chrome OS, WiFi 6, Mercury Gray",859,samsung
2048,Kindle Customer1,2021,5,"Great computer, bad battery.","TL;DR great computer with cool features but compromised battery for thinness. The first thing I have to say is that the screen quality is superb and paired with tablet mode is a defiant win in my book. The s pen is muchmore functional on a Note 20 ultra than a computer, it is a cool gimmick and makes presentations easier because of the red dot feature. The i5 is a medium stage processor, I was going to buy a dell with an i7 but decided that the i5 was good enough, the thinness is also extremely convenient having a decent computer without added weight. There are a few cons though, the battery life is comparable to the note 20 ultra running full boar. This computer also only runs chrome which can be a downside to some but not to me. The c charger on both sides is one of the best parts of this computer because now I only need the fast charger it came with to charge my phone, computer, or headphones. The lighted keyboard makes a big difference in the dark and the camera near the keyboard made to take photos in tablet mode is cool because it looks like a big note 20. It also says on streaming services that it is running 8k but the screen is only capable of 4k. Overall this is a good student computer and worth the money, but if you need the windows just buy the new galaxy book pro. 6.9inch note 20 ultra for scale, 1:1 scale on both s pens. Viewing screen size is the same as the note 20 ultra, about 1.5 the size of an s8+ of note 20 ultra thickness wise. This thing is phone thin. Samsung has yet to fail me.","SAMSUNG 13.3” Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM,4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, Ultra Slim Design, Chrome OS, WiFi 6, Mercury Gray",859,samsung
2049,Ron G.,2022,3,no aftermarket support. could not find a polycarbonate cover or keyboard cover,"I never used the computer. After trying to find a keyboard cover and hardshell cover, I came to realize per many reviews that the high resolution screen is battery intensive to a fault, as well as heat producing. Some say the battery will only last 4 hours. The large perforated area on the bottom is to dissipate the heat generated by the power hungry screen. Honestly, I just took it out of the box and put it back and returned it after realizing there were no keyboard covers or polycarbonate cases for this model. Although I never actually even turned it on, if you read the reviews and see the screen resolution, you will see why the aftermarket industry leaves it alone. I think the screen overburdens the device.","SAMSUNG 13.3” Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM,4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, Ultra Slim Design, Chrome OS, WiFi 6, Mercury Gray",859,samsung
2050,Jed Rothwell,2021,1,Not reliable. First unit and and replacement unit both crash and hang.,"This is a beautiful little Chromebook. It is light, with a high resolution screen, and a nice keyboard. Unfortunately, it is unreliable. I got one about a month ago. Several times a day it crashed. It stopped while I was working, or when I opened the top to turn it back on, it had crashed back to the sign-on screen with a message: ""Chrome didn't shut down correctly."" It also hung up, refusing to turn on until you held the power key for 20 seconds. Also, it did not work with the wi-fi extender. A ""powerwash"" reset did not help.Amazon gave me a replacement unit with no argument. It arrived yesterday. Yesterday it crashed once, and hung up once. Today it crashed again. Modern computer equipment is reliable so this is unusual. I do not think it is a coincidence that two out of two are unreliable.In my opinion, the designers put too much effort into strange features such as the stylus, and a non-working fingerprint detection key. (I finally got it to register after several attempts, but it does not sign on to anything.) They should have made it more reliable instead.I will probably keep it, because a Chromebook is more of a glorified i-Pad more than it is a computer. As long as you can browse, it is okay, even if it crashes unexpectedly. It has various applications such as word processing, but they are all the Google on-line versions, so you do not lose your work when it crashes. I will keep this one, but I would not recommend it to anyone.I recommend Chromebooks in general. For my purposes they are much better than laptop computers. I had another one for many years, from another maker. It never had problems like this. It finally died of old age, but it was reliable for a long time.FOLLOW UP: The replacement unit crashed 5 times in one day, so I returned it for a refund. Again, Amazon did not give me any trouble. They suggested I contact Samsung and tell them I had problems with two units. The woman at Samsung said, ""we have not heard of any problems like that."" I told her to come here to Amazon and read these reviews. I have a feeling that someone in their organization is not letting the bad news about this product spread through the company.","SAMSUNG 13.3” Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM,4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, Ultra Slim Design, Chrome OS, WiFi 6, Mercury Gray",859,samsung
2051,James Hawk,2021,5,4K AMOLED screen is beyond belief,"Despite the valid short battery life reports, I bought the Samsung as it was being discounted before new models were introduced, and very pleased with the speed and especially the jaw-dropping screen, and now it's dropped another hundred bucks - what a steal !  I'd read other raves about the 4K AMOLED screen (made by Samsung), but seeing was almost not believing.  Colors are so deep, so brilliant, and when you switch a YouTube video from regular high def to 4K resolution, it becomes crystal clear - best way to describe it is that it appears I'm looking at a real image through glass.  Specs for the 13.3 inch screen are 3840 X 2160 pixels, which some think is overkill but I disagree because of the pure viewing pleasure it provides.  The rest of the hardware is super fast and a quality build.  If you buy a newer version of this, just make sure it's got the 3840 x 2160 screen !","SAMSUNG 13.3” Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM,4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, Ultra Slim Design, Chrome OS, WiFi 6, Mercury Gray",859,samsung

Sellers responded to me soon enough and they sent me the device without a scratch, they should have labeled it like new and not just good as condition as people would get the wrong impression.

2055,C. Matthew Hawkins,2021,2,"Nice Design, But Unreliable Performance","The machine's design is sleek, video images are sharp and clear, the computer is lightweight, however, the big problem with this computer is that it is extremely buggy, which makes it unreliable if you are trying to get work done.Although the touch screen always seems to work well enough, you will lose many hours of productive time when the trackpad fails and, of course, it always fails at the most inconvenient times.Also, the backlight on the keyboard only works occasionally. There is no telling when it will or will not work. This makes the computer unreliable when it comes to getting work done. But it looks nice.The printed letters and numbers on the keyboard are often difficult to read due to a lack of contrast against the color of the keys. This means that you will occasionally have to squint and turn your head at odd angles to make sure your fingers are properly positioned, and this can slow you down. Moreover, although it is possible to find workarounds for the deficiencies of this machine, the flaws in its design, its hardware, and its software will kill the flow of your creativity.Overall, the item looks nice; it is visually appealing.

2058,EGates,2021,2,Poorly designed for basic usage,"After all the positive reviews of this chromebook, I am very disappointed. Yes, it is sleek and lightweight, which I do appreciate.  However, many key design features make it really uncomfortable to use.  For starters, the screen is highly reflective - so much so, that it is difficult to see what is on the screen.  Right now, I have a beautiful view through the window behind me; however, I can barely see what I am typing.  I am constantly turning the screen brightness to the max simply to cut through the reflections.  Second, the contrast on the keyboard is way too low; the letters themselves are all but invisible.  The letters are light gray on medium grey keys.  So, I am also constantly turning up the brightness on the keyboard.  Last but not least, the webcam is really terrible - my image is fuzzy at best, and, unless the room is extremely bright, I am shrouded in darkness.  For some reason, this device has a high res cam that faces outwards, and another one which faces upwards (just above the keyboard).  Why are these so good, while the webcam is so bad? Not the right book for me, for sure.","SAMSUNG 13.3” Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM,4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, Ultra Slim Design, Chrome OS, WiFi 6, Mercury Gray",859,samsung

THEN, while doing the settings and making my account, it started to glitch. Streaks of lines keeps popping in and out of the screen horizontally. One glitched line stayed on the screen for a good 10-15 seconds. I had to powerwash it before returning it.

2102,John Wolnisty,2022,5,Great for what I paid,"I needed a knockaround laptop to take when I travel.  I used to take my tablet, but more and more I need a full keyboard and a close to full laptop experience.  I don't want to take my work laptop, as I can't risk it.  I've now done a couple of trips with this Chromebook - and it fills the bill.  Is the screen brilliant sharp?  No.  Is it lightning fast? No.  Does it do the job I bought it for?  Absolutely!  And for not too many sheckels.  I rate this a great buy and am glad I picked it up.  Wifi works well.  Battery life is great.  Recharges quick.  I've used it for web surfing, meetings, on-line documents, you-tube watching and movie watching when the hotel options sucked.  If I have any complaint it would be I wish the speakers could put out a bit more volume.","Samsung Chromebook 4 Chrome OS 11.6"" HD Intel Celeron Processor N4000 4GB RAM 32GB eMMC Gigabit Wi-Fi - XE310XBA-K01US",179,samsung

2104,James Cochrun,2021,4,Power charger is the HDMI out-put as well.,"A good little machine.  If you just want to use it to surf the internet and that sort of thing, can't beat the price.  I knew the screen wasn't going to be the best before i bought it, and in fairness the images are a little flat, but again I just use it as an internet surfer platform.  HOWEVER,..., what i wish I did know before i bought it, and would have been a reason why i WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT IT is the ports available.  It DOES NOT have an HDMI port, only the mini port which is how you charge it.  So i would also use my Chrome book to watch streaming on my TV, connecting it to my larger TV, to do so i had to buy an adapter to plug in a full size HDMI into the mini, but in doing so you CANNOT charge it, so if you are watching a movie, or anything you have to run off battery power, it will always have enough to get you through a movie, but the stress of watching the batter life slowly march down to zero really plays on my anxiety.  Further there is only one USB port, so if you have a cordless mouse plugged in you can't plug in any other USB, example, if you want to download from your phone you have to unplug the cordless mouse, which drives me nuts.  But do note that it has bluetooth capabilities so you can always get a blue tooth mouse to solve that problem, I'm just not tech savy enough to pull that off.  in the end the lack of a full size HDMI AND also a charger would make me buy a different machine, but i already have it, and i make it work, stress and all when running it off battery at my work station or TV.  Just something i wish i had looked into more before i bought it.  Hope that helps.  Also there isn't a 'Delete' button, why ?","Samsung Chromebook 4 Chrome OS 11.6"" HD Intel Celeron Processor N4000 4GB RAM 32GB eMMC Gigabit Wi-Fi - XE310XBA-K01US",179,samsung
2105,Sandra H.,2022,3,Buttons problematic,"The power button is right where the delete key would be on a Windows keyboard, which means my muscle memory makes me hit it over and over while trying to write normally. Fortunately, it always asks if I'm sure before it actually tries to power down, but it does disrupt my workflow.The right-click seems to be completely non-functional on this model, so anything I need a right-click to accomplish (like pinning apps to my quick-start bar) I just can't do.When I went to write this review, one of the features I was asked to review was the touch-screen; as far as I can tell, this model does not have a touch-screen, or if it does, mine was broken new out of the box.The screen is low quality but serviceable. The sound quality is clear, but the volume won't go very high. The battery life is great.

2109,Avery Commons,2022,3,School use ***Updated***,"***Update***Second one arrived with no micro-sd slot??? The specs are the same, labeling and serials match up, but no micro slot. Ok so I exchanged it for another one since it was probably a fluke but NOPE my replacement also came sans micro slot. Finally figured it out that the the one with the slot was manufactured in 1/21 and the one without was 5/21. Apparently the 5/21 was in the midst of the chip crisis, so Samsung redesigned the chassis to omit the SD feature,  and subsequently scrubbed future models of the SD being standard. The owners manual was even changed to reflect SD being an ""option"". Dishonest and frustrating but not illegal. I'm disappointed but luckily it is not a deal breaker, just a feature I was expecting.*Original*Honestly so great for school use. I've got one in public high school and one in virtual high school- Public child broke her mid range full size laptop so we bought her this as a 'punishment' of sorts, cause compared to her other one this is a pos (spec wise) and because she needed one for school. Was not about to be on the hook for a school computer either. Once she got all set up on it, Virtual child became jealous and wanted her own, despite the fact she has a top of the line full size laptop. It's been going so well for Public child that we decided to get one for Virtual too. Honestly it's basic and if all you're doing on it is web browsing and school work, this is the end all be all of your shopping. I bought the 4gig models but we also have external drives and memory cards they can work off of if need be. Has no issues connecting to public school wifi or home wifi, no issues at all, actually.

If that matters, a less distracting grayscale over an addictive color display would be desirable.

I carry it around from living room to home office pretty often too. No issues with that.The only issue I've had is with using Citrix Workspace with dual monitors - I have a docking station and 2 work monitors hooked up to the laptop, and they work great with no issues most of the time.

2155,TheIronFreak722,2022,2,"Great portability, nice look, but not worth the price.","This laptop caught my eye when I was in the market for a new one. I needed something solid for university, and this came into my feed. Needless to say, I was intrigued, but this laptop has some major flaws.The good things about this laptop really have to do only with the sleek, slender and portable design and the fact that it is extremely portable and easy to carry around. Everything else was incredibly underwhelming for the price tag.The hinges on the laptop are flimsy, and not secure. Typing on the laptop rattles the screen and is an unpleasant feature when on a video call for example. The touchpad is one of the worst touchpads I've ever seen, you can feel it click through the bottom of the laptop and you can also accidentally click while just scrolling. It is very poorly designed and not something you'd expect from a $1000+ laptop.Software is abysmal! Constant freezing, flickering and it blue screened 3 times with me within the first WEEK! Fan noise can be tuned out but the performance of this laptop is worse than my $250 Acer laptop from 2020.I figured some of the negative reviews were all bs, so I thought I'd bite. What a poor, empty excuse for a laptop. I'm hoping I just got some faulty unit but that still doesn't make up for everything else.Avoid this laptop.

It cracked just by transporting it in my cushioned backpack.BTW, if you pay the repair, they replace the parts with the same ones, so it will happen again. Basically if you want to avoid screen to crack, you need to use it as a desktop. Forget about transporting it , tablet, touch screen or pen features.Don't ever trust Samsung customer support.

In any event I saw that this same model was a bit more and decided to make the purchase.  No regret! I LOVE this light weight ""evo"" Samsung 15 inch laptop.  I do travel and carrying the old heavy one was a strain carrying it around.  This 16 Ram lightweight laptop is fast, starts up fast, plenty of storage and overall is a great laptop for the price.

2177,Rob S,2022,5,Like night and day,"The last laptop I bought - a Lenovo - had an optical drive. So nearly a decade old. But it was a total workhorse for work and home use. And needed replacement.After *lots* of reading and research I landed on the Samsung Galaxy Book Pro, in no small no part because my Samsung Galaxy 10+ phone has done so well.Also? This was in stock! Several others I looked at were either out when I started looking, or went to backorder while I was on the hunt. And the Amazon 5-payment plan was a little kinder on my budget.Screen is incredible. Backlit keyboard. RAM is nearly triple what my old machine had (16gb v 6), so using Photoshop now is no big deal while I'm using several other apps simultaneously. It sure used to be. And it takes about a second - yep - once you flip the screen open to wake.Downside? It's *very* thin and *very* light compared to my old machine, so that's taken some getting used to. I need to hold it in place while I open the screen. And right now it actually sits ON the old one when I'm working. But it's still new yet.Looks like it's a bit more expensive now ( I paid about $1100) but I think still a deal for what you'll be getting, esp if you haven't upgraded in a while as was my case.Highly recommend.","Samsung Galaxy Book Pro Windows 11 Intel Evo Platform Laptop Computer 15.6"" AMOLED Screen 11th Gen Intel Core i7 Processor 16GB Memory 512GB SSD Long-Lasting Battery, Mystic Blue",1049,samsung

The whole left side from top to bottom row not space bar got hot and all the way over to the 6 key. It was plugged in when this happened just doing the setup. On the battery the y-under side gets warm and this was just surfing the web. It is really light, the screen is really nice. It is not a touch screen which doesn't bother me, but Windows 11 is geared more to the touch screen. The battery will not last 20 hours like they say in description. I just did 1 hour of surfing and I lost 25% of the battery just surfing.All in all it is a good laptop for now. We got it on sale so I grab it. I got the midnight blue, wanted the white, but white was listed as Chrome OS and I wanted Windows. I  believe the laptop is worth it but we will test it more and try to update the review.update: still getting heat issues when downloading or sometimes just when charging on the left side of the unit.  when downloading tonight it got so warm and the fan was so loud trying to cool it off.","Samsung Galaxy Book Pro Windows 11 Intel Evo Platform Laptop Computer 15.6"" AMOLED Screen 11th Gen Intel Core i7 Processor 16GB Memory 512GB SSD Long-Lasting Battery, Mystic Blue",1049,samsung
2179,Steph,2022,5,Worth every penny!,"After spending alot of time researching many different chromebooks, tablets and laptops in the $200-500 that would best suit my needs I found myself getting frustrated and overwhelmed by the process and was about 30 seconds from giving up and settling on one that was not ideal just to get the process over with. That is when this beauty miraculously appeared! Not only did it check 9 out of 10 of the boxes I needed it to, it was also 1/2 the price compared to others I researched in this category.  I love the design and versatility of having a laptop and tablet in one option.  I also like that unlike some of the other 2 in 1 chromebooks it is not flimsy and they clearly took into consideration the lifestyle needs of a 2 in 1 chromebook keeping it lightweight yet very sturdy. The battery life is wonderful, it charges quickly and a full charged has lasted me over a full day at work as I used it continuously for a total of 10.45hrs before it got down to the red at 15%. And that was without turning on the battery saver option! The display is clean, crisp & vivid. Whether it's used for streaming a movie or creating a new document, you will be satisfied with the visuals for sure. Set up was a breeze as was learning the ins and outs of all this chromebook offers. The only ""complaint"" I have in regards to this specific model is the lack of protective cases designed to fit it. I understand this is not a issue about the product itself but I did want to make people aware of it as there is only 1 brand of hard cover cases that fit it and do not have to be removed for use(mCover hard shell case for 12.2in Samsung v2 chromebook).I highly recommend also using a padded waterproof shock absorbent carry case as well for travel, as the hard case is mainly to protect from scratches and dings and WILL NOT protect it in the event it is dropped, banged or similar.  The other recommendation is a 9H screen protector, especially if you plan to use the touch screen and stylist pen options. If I could give it 10stars I would.

I don't really care for it as it's so tiny, but I know that some may not be okay with it for it appears to be an irremovable speck of dirt. Another issue is that the stylus has a bit of delay. Another is that the scrolling is a bit wonky in Android apps, I can not use two fingers on the mouse pad to scroll in the Discord app for example, but I can use the pen/my finger to operate it from the screen as I would on my phone. This makes sense since it is an Android app after all, but it'd be nice to not have to switch back and forth from laptop to pen abilities. The app drawer is only properly functionable when using the pen or your finger.I fell asleep with it the laptop on, and woke several hours later. My battery did not empty in my absence of activity, and none of my progress was lost. Though it did not lock my screen, but I am pretty sure I can fix that in the settings. I am just amazed that it did not die and nothing was lost even though I left it for several hours. The laptop is also extremely quiet I now realize, I have not heard a single mechanical noise coming from it and I am typing this from a silent room.Also, Chrome OS isn't that bad, I had planned to attempt to download Ubuntu on it, I am still going to get it to have more useful software available, but I will also use Chrome OS since it's not as bad as I thought it would be.Overall the computer is pretty epic","Samsung Chromebook Plus V2, 2-in-1, 4GB RAM, 32GB eMMC, 13MP Camera, Chrome OS, 12.2"", 16:10 Aspect Ratio, Light Titan (XE520QAB-K01US)",299,samsung
2185,David Edwards,2019,5,"It's more like ""2/3 laptop, 1/3 tablet"" rather than a 2-in-1.","I've been in the market for a cheap laptop for work for a while.  I have a hefty gaming PC at home but I wanted something completely separate and portable for non-gaming needs like using the internet and word processing.  Additionally I've been trying to read more and sometimes this leads to me using the Kindle app on my phone.  I was drawn to the Chromebook Plus (V2) because of the attempts to make it more like a tablet and utilize Android apps.Overall the product works exactly as described.  The screen is good, though the default settings make the things like the app shelf, window borders, and pointer size a little too large in comparison to the parts of the screen in use.  This is variable once you poke around the settings, though, and I have no complaints.  The keyboard is fantastic and responsive.  The touchscreen is pretty good, though it's not quite on par with the perfection that is an iPad touch screen.  Sometimes I miss when I try to click on things with my finger or perhaps it doesn't register at all.  That happens so infrequently that it's still entirely usable.  The pen is also nice, though I've only used it so far to doodle in the Google Keep notes app as it was not a main selling point for me.  The battery life is about on par with what is advertised; I used it lightly from 7:30-2:30 yesterday, for example, and it only got to about 50%.  The foldability for tent and tablet mode is a little bit awkward considering the size and the fact that the keyboard is always attached, but it works.  It just makes me prefer it as a laptop more than a tablet most of the time.The performance is acceptable considering the hardware.  With my other machine having a much more powerful processor and more RAM, I actually do notice a bit of delay in navigation online and when using multiple apps.  With that said, it's not bad at all, and the comparison is actually rather unfair.My main complaint is really only the quality of the touchpad for using the cursor.  It works well, but it's a little bit choppy and doesn't respond to light and subtle movements when trying to be precise.  Again, this might be unfair because the only recent laptops I've used have been MacBooks and those touchpads are incredibly smooth, but it's still worth pointing out.Overall I'm highly satisfied with my purchase.  The problems I've described really aren't even problems but rather little quirks that I've already gotten used to.  It works for everything you'd want a Chromebook to work for and it does it well.","Samsung Chromebook Plus V2, 2-in-1, 4GB RAM, 32GB eMMC, 13MP Camera, Chrome OS, 12.2"", 16:10 Aspect Ratio, Light Titan (XE520QAB-K01US)",299,samsung

It looks and acts like new. I needed to replace my old acer chromebook that was starting to freeze up. So far I'm very happy with this Samsung chromebook. It's still under warrenty, the keyboard is very responsive and clicky. I use it mainly for work, editing videos, photos then uploading them to my website. Granted I've only had it for a few days but it's been very fast without any lag. I typically have about 8-10 tabs open at a time, this hasn't caused any slow downs. It got about 3 updates when I got it up and running. It's now on chrome 93.0.4577.95. Having the s-pen is also a bonus since I do some journaling. So far I'm happy with my purchase. It is a bit heavy so keep that in mind. Battery life is about average nothing great. I do wish that each side had a usb C port instead of them both on the left side.

Didn’t bother checking out any of the other features because it’s not what I wanted. But if you want a small laptop for drawing and playing games on then this is perfect.

2190,Ian B,2018,3,Decent convertible with tradeoffs,"This is a decent hybrid and good for basic browser/tablet tasks. If you try to do much more with it, you might be disappointed. I'm ok with the $350 Black Friday price, but would be disappointed if I spent $500 on this, so giving it 3 stars instead of 4. Paying $600 for the m3 processor would be too much for this class of device, especially with only 4gb ram. It does fine for browsing, but Android apps can be kind of glitchy.  Touch responsiveness can be spotty in tablet mode. This might be ChromeOS' fault, but it's an advertised feature and should be expected to work. Using a 2k external monitor over usb-c works, but is choppy. I'm guessing this is a combination of the low ram and integrated graphics (cpu usage wasn't high). I wouldn't do it regularly. I like that is has 2 usb-c ports, but putting them both on the same side is annoying. The screen half is much heavier than other laptops I've used and makes it hard to balance on your lap. The camera on the body is pointless unless you plan to take photos in tablet mode (don't be that person). The keyboard is fine, but the touchpad is a little cramped. This just comes with the territory on this size device.Basically it does a lot of things adequately and not much more. If you're ok with that, you might like it. For the price, you could get a much better tablet or laptop, but this gives you a little of both.Pros:- USB-C- Screen- Stylus- Size- Build qualityCons:- Speed/responsiveness- Weight (top-heavy screen)- Thickness- Price","Samsung Chromebook Plus V2, 2-in-1, 4GB RAM, 32GB eMMC, 13MP Camera, Chrome OS, 12.2"", 16:10 Aspect Ratio, Light Titan (XE520QAB-K01US)",299,samsung

2192,Joanne Wolfe,2019,4,"Nice, but buyer beware","The Samsung Chromebook V2 is a super nice product; however, buyers beware that this particular item did NOT have a mobile device chip installed, necessitating my purchasing a $99 Jetpak from Verizon in order to get their unlimited wi-fi plan. I bought the Chromebook to use when traveling extensively in the US and Canada, so I need wi-fi on the device at all times. If you buy the Chromebook from Verizon, it comes with the chip installed. So I ended up paying quite a bit more than I was hoping for given the fact that I initially got a good deal on Amazon. It's not recommended that you use your cellular phone as a wi-fi hot spot for the Chromebook. And I don't have a smart phone anyway, so that was not an option for me. Otherwise, so far I love the Chromebook and would buy it again, for sure. Track pad and touch screen are super responsive  and the keyboard is quite nice as well. Screen has great resolution and sound quality is fair.

It does the former better than the latter, but if I'm crunched for weight and space, it does the job.  I import music scores from PDF into Squid (Android app) and I can mark them up with the stylus.  A little unwieldy as a tablet, just because it is so big.  It has no direct connection to HDMI, but I bought an inexpensive USB-C adapter and we are in business.  Same for full-size SD cards.  However, it does have one built-in USB 3.0 connection, so you don't need an adapter for USB sticks.Wi-fi performance appears to be a little weak compared to some other devices I have, but has worked okay.","Samsung Chromebook Plus V2, 2-in-1, 4GB RAM, 32GB eMMC, 13MP Camera, Chrome OS, 12.2"", 16:10 Aspect Ratio, Light Titan (XE520QAB-K01US)",299,samsung
2197,Dsol303,2021,1,Not worth the hype. Glitchy and heavy,"I was really excited to try a Chromebook and searched around through many of them before choosing this one. I wanted it for my travels as something smaller that could fit in my purse or bag. Unfortunately during my trip there were many times when I would try to turn it on and it just would not turn on. Or it would be frozen up. And it was brand new. The battery life lasts a long time but what's the point when I can't get it to even turn on or open a program. And although the size was right, or I thought it was, it is actually very heavy for its size. The weight of it in my purse actually made my shoulders hurt where my purse strap was. It's quite hefty. It doesn't seem like it for the first few minutes but as you continue on with it you can really feel its weight. At this size I feel like it's kind of pointless. It's not small enough to easily fit in a purse or small bag, and definitely not light enough. But it's also too small to be a decent laptop for home. Unfortunately by the time I got back from my trip, only having used it a couple times, the return window had closed and so I'm not able to return it. So now I'm stuck with this. If the seller could contact me so I can return this it would be great.","Samsung Chromebook Plus V2, 2-in-1, 4GB RAM, 32GB eMMC, 13MP Camera, Chrome OS, 12.2"", 16:10 Aspect Ratio, Light Titan (XE520QAB-K01US)",299,samsung

2229,Tech nerd,2020,5,Lightest laptop I have ever owned!,"Don't believe the negative reviews! This is a great laptop.The best thing about this laptop is the screen then the weight. The Qled screen is absolutely the best LCD screen on the market with superior brightness, saturation and color accuracy. The 13.3"" size screen in full HD is just beautiful and I believe they have applied an anti-reflective coating on the glass screen. So even though the screen is glossy there is very little refraction. The Ion is the only model with this AR coating. It is very similar to the 13"" macbook pro screen but not as high resolution. In other words unless you have an OLED panel you will not find a better looking screen on any other laptop!!The performance of this device is actually very good but I really think they could have used AMD Ryzen processors with much better results. The i7 this laptop uses is fast but it is not on the newer 10nm architecture which I would have preferred. I would have also preferred 12gb ram as a base for all models. All of that being said this thing is very fast for what it is. My complaints are more about future proofing. For what I use this laptop for it is very fast.Now to the build quality and other features. The build and design of this laptop is one of my favorites of 2020. It has excellent industrial design and minimal bezels. Fit and finish are very good but not perfect. The silver finish is very good at resisting fingerprints. The keyboard is excellent. The glass trackpad is also excellent and can charge your phone!Battery life is also very good. The claims by Samsung are inflated as are all battery life claims on a laptop but what I can say is for an ultra portable the 69 watt hour battery is very large and will get your through a solid day. That is with screen brightness on high, cpu performance set to high.The speakers on this laptop are great and get very loud and have a good amount of bass. You have to get updates for the drivers in samsung update and then adjust the settings in realtek audio console but once you do the sound is amazing. I look at how small this thing is and the sound coming out of it and I am impressed.To wrap it all up this is one of my favorite laptops to use. It is not a speed demon but it can handle it's own, it is super light and portable with great battery life. It does everything I need it to do and has a decent selection of ports including a thunderbolt 3 port. The fit and finish and design are all great. I really like the magnesium build. It does have some flex here and there because it is not using a thick piece of aluminum but a thinner stronger piece of Magnesium. I would just say that you should look for sales. The full retail price is too high IMO but the sale price is a good value considering the features you can only get in this laptop and the competition in the same price range.Samsung has really done an excellent job with it's offerings this year. I am very excited to see what is to come. Just add more ram next time!!",Samsung Galaxy Book Ion 15.6” Laptop| QLED Display and Intel Core i7 Processor | 8GB Memory | 512GB SSD | Long Battery Life and Windows 10 Operating System | (NP950XCJ-K01US),1291,samsung
2230,Teacher of Muggles,2021,4,"Lightweight and Functional, Poor Battery Life","I’m amazed at how lightweight this computer is. Almost too lightweight in a sense that I forget it’s in my bag when I’m carrying it. The screen and sound are good. Nothing crazy high quality but good enough to watch a movie when your kids are stealing the three other TVs in the house. I mainly use it for teaching and normal home use and I love everything about it… EXCEPT… one small detail that is turning out to be a big annoyance. The shift key on the right hand side is tiny… I mean smaller than every other keyboard that I have ever used due to the thumbprint key. I wish I could get rid of it in place of a normal size shift key. Overall… I hate to say I wouldn’t buy this computer because of ONE key… but man… there have been many curse words uttered when having to backspace because I missed the shift key in the middle of typing.UPDATE - I have had this computer for a few months now and it’s great. However, my school I teach at has gone virtual and the battery doesn’t last me a full day, not unless on the absolute lowest power settings which isn’t realistic to work on for 8 hours. It’s a big downside if you need to be on your computer without charging it for an extended amount of time.",Samsung Galaxy Book Ion 15.6” Laptop| QLED Display and Intel Core i7 Processor | 8GB Memory | 512GB SSD | Long Battery Life and Windows 10 Operating System | (NP950XCJ-K01US),1291,samsung
2231,Alemore,2020,4,"Beautiful laptop, very light weight with an excellent screen","First of all, I have to say that this is the lightest laptop that I've ever owned. The specs are very good. There are some small quirks that I've had to learn to live with though. First of all, even though I like the fingerprint sensor for logging in, they cut the right shift key in half to place the fingerprint sensor there. I have had to get used to that particular modification since I kept missing the shift key.The shell of the laptop flexes, especially the bottom where the vents are. I feel as if I need to be especially careful not to squeeze the laptop to avoid bending the casing. This hasn't happened so it may be me, but I don't want to tempt fate either.The mouse pad is nice but sensitivity may be a tad high. I often engage the pad with my right palm when using the keyboard. I haven't found a way to throttle down the sensitivity.For a laptop in this class, Samsung chose to include a traditional power plug instead of the newer magnetic type. Bad move by them there. A magnetic type of power cord would be perfectly fitting for this laptop and enhance it's respectability.Ok now, aside from the above, there are so many things that I love about this laptop. The laptop is very light weight. It is beautiful to look at from the outside. The lit keyboard is nice. The screen is absolutely beautiful. The keyboard keys feel good. Aesthetically, this laptop is a winner - no doubt. For that reason, all the things that I don't like are overshadowed by how nice this laptop is. But at the price point, I feel that the quirks should not have been let go so it's only fair to take off one star for overall lack of value.",Samsung Galaxy Book Ion 15.6” Laptop| QLED Display and Intel Core i7 Processor | 8GB Memory | 512GB SSD | Long Battery Life and Windows 10 Operating System | (NP950XCJ-K01US),1291,samsung
2232,David,2021,2,Mediocre product for a premium price,"Samsung Product SupportThe laptop arrived with a faulty pixel. Amazon told me to contact Samsung support. I tried to do that but since I’m in Europe, the Samsung support site would not allow me to contact them through their web forms or chat function (there is no email). The site just kept complaining that I’m in the wrong region. So I contacted the local Samsung Service Centre but they refused to serve the product since it wasn’t bought in Europe. With Samsung you are always in the wrong region it seems.Warranty wise, If you want to travel I would therefore not recommend Samsung products. This is too bad, really, because the laptop would be a pretty good travel companion. It’s very light for its size.The batteryThe battery is one of the best features. It is very good and you can limit charging to 85% in order to preserve battery health.The ScreenI’m quite baffled by the many glowing reviews of this screen. The only really good thing about this screen is the brightness which is quite amazing, but the screen is very reflective so even with that brightness, it can be hard to use it outdoors.There is a lot of back bleeding, and the contrast is really not that good. I’ve used many lcd-screens that are better in that regard (and I’m not talking about oled screens). The lowest brightness setting is also still pretty bright so it’s not great for night use either.The KeyboardThe keyboard is ok, a bit cramped and off-center because of the numpad but ok. The keyboard backlight is very bad however. The automatic brightness detection frequently turns on the brightness even during bright conditions which makes the keys almost impossible to see since they are white. You can manually override the brightness in windows, so it’s only slightly annoying in that case. But in linux you have no control over keyboard backlight so then it becomes more of an issue.The FanIn silent mode, the fan is almost never on and there is no coil whining so it’s dead silent most of the time should you want to use that mode.The touchpadThe touchpad is downright bad. Two finger scrolls are terrible. It frequently fails to activate or it activates the drag function instead. Two finger clicks are also a hit-and-miss affair, with the cursor jumping wildly when you try to use it (also sometimes marking texts in the process). I'm not even that picky when it comes to touchpads, but compared to the last five touchpads I've used (chromebooks and regular Windows laptops) this one is the worst by far and the only one I feel the need to use a regular mouse with.Linux compatibilityLinux works reasonably well, with the only real problem being the lack of control of keyboard backlight (the brightness still works, you just can’t control it). The sound will probably not work out of the gate, but can be fixed if you google the problem.I could not get the fingerprint reader to work either, but that is a minor issue.In conclusionA very bright (but not very good) screen, excellent battery life, light and silent (if you are willing to sacrifice some performance by using silent mode), but otherwise a very mediocre product for a premium price. Samsung after sale support is not very supporting.Update: The laptop got a BIOS (...or EUFI to be correct) update and now the touchpad is working much better. I no longer have any complaints about two finger scrolling and clicking. The touchpad is now perfectly fine, this also holds true for Linux use.",Samsung Galaxy Book Ion 15.6” Laptop| QLED Display and Intel Core i7 Processor | 8GB Memory | 512GB SSD | Long Battery Life and Windows 10 Operating System | (NP950XCJ-K01US),1291,samsung
2233,Elad,2021,4,"Overall solid build and functions, light weight, very fast, with a few minor annoyances","I was astonished at both how light and how fast this unit is compared to my previous Samsung.  The battery life is much longer and charges fast.  The screen is bright and looks good; easy to view.  A minor complaint is the speakers, but I generally don't have them very loud, anyway...it isn't that a big of a deal for me though I don't use it for Zoom or similar activities.  I do a lot of simple games on it, and they function well.  Occasionally after I have opened a game and am engaged in it, it will suddenly flip back to the game selection menu but the active game is on the task bar and opens right up....haven't figured out why it does that.  My biggest complaint is that the fingerprint ID security function is hit and miss whether it works or not; generally I just use my pin to access.

2234,Sam,2020,5,This is a real innovation.,"This is my third Samsung Ultrabook laptop since 2013 July.  The reason why I only have used Samsung Ultrabook series is that the laptop is really light. For example, the first generation is about 2.7 LB (it was purchased in 2013 July). The second generation is about 1.8LB (it was purchased in 2018 November). The previous models have some issues (e.g., battery life, display quality, and so on). However, the Galaxy Book Ion (the third generation of Samsung Ultrabook series) overcame all issues. For example, you can operate the laptop without charger about 10 hours.  Also, charging speed is so fast. In addition the touch pad has wireless charger function. The sound quality is so great (Although I have Bose NC-700, Sony WH-1000XM3, and Airpod Pro, I listen a music from the laptop without any headset in my home). I purchased the 15.6 inch for upgrading RAM (13.3 inch may not support ram upgrade). Because the screen is so clear , I believe that the laptop seems to be customized for Prime video, Netflix, and Youtube. Lastly, the design is what I wanted.

2239,sara,2021,1,Light on weight. Heavy on regret.,"With my old laptop failing due to age I spent some time researching available options for replacement. I settled on the Samsung Galaxy Book Ion 15 for a number of reasons. The only shortcomings were the low memory and small drive space. Both of those are upgradeable in the 15"" model so I ordered the upgrades for both at the same time as the laptop.  After opening the case to put in the new upgrades I found that the screw to retain the second NVMe drive wasn't there. Having watched videos of others placing in a new drive in this same laptop as well as seeing pictures of the process I knew this screw was certainly supposed to be there. I contacted Samsung support only to be told my options were to either order the screw from their parts supplier (at my cost) or to send the entire unit in to be serviced.  This laptop is needed to replace a now non functioning laptop used for work. I went 2 days without one while the new laptop was shipped. I can't afford to send the laptop away for who knows how long and simply not get any work done in the meantime. I also shouldn't be expected to pay for the mistakes made at the facility where this laptop was assembled.  To add further insult to injury, I noticed a spot on the screen when there was a light colored background. At first sight I figured it was a speck of dust on the screen or the like. It wouldn't wipe away. It wasn't even on the screen. It's under the screen. It doesn't appear to be a dead pixel. Possibly a bit of dust that got under the glass during assembly? No matter it's cause, it's there. And of course now that I know that it's there, it's all I can see.  So after nearly $1500 into the laptop and it's upgrades I expected to be thrilled with my new work laptop for years to come. Instead, I am left with massive regret for my costly, poor quality purchase that I can't afford to send back. I'm stuck with this.  Samsung quality failed me and their own support department chose to discard a new customer rather than make it right.

I can honestly say if the display wasn't so awesome I would have probably sent this laptop back but a good clear, good, bright display is very important to me.

2273,"Dr. Jerry Parks, National Teacher's Hall of Fame, 2009",2021,5,“Simply the nicest laptop I’ve ever owned. Period.”,"I currently own six laptops, and have owned Latitudes, Elitebooks, XPS models, Pavilions, Surface Pros, Thinkpads, Envy’s, etc. This is the finest one I’ve ever owned, even though I never imagined buying a Samsung laptop!First off, it’s so very light. Secondly, I’ve never seen, much less owned, a screen so bright and deeply saturated. And when it turns on (about 4 seconds), and you hit F10, the colors go from gorgeous to unbelievable. Yes, the screen brightness is what I love most. And to get that Samsung QLED screen on steroids, well, it is unparalleled in color brightness. The high-end Elitebook with the 1000-nit screen was close, but it had what I call a ‘rolling shadow’ every time the screen was moved forward or backward. Not a flaw, just the way many were made. Not on the ION. Move that lid backward or forward and no ‘shadow’…ever.This bright screen does not hurt the battery much, either. The laptop won’t get 21 hours, but with fine-tuning it will last many hours. As others have noted, the sound is not great, but who really buys a laptop depending on its sound. I also love the tiny lighted (!) AC plug-in to the laptop, and the blazing-fast fingerprint reader is flawless.The 10th Gen. i7 processor just flies. Files copy really fast, and everything moves like it was 2023! Size-wise this thing is THIN. Slips into virtually any purse or protective case as smooth as butter. More than once I thought I was pulling out my iPad.  The keyboard isn’t a Latitude, but it’s a pleasure to use. Brightly lighted too.Small negatives—the fan runs constantly, and the bottom gets pretty warm, even with the roll-under screen edge meant to increase airflow. Also, it’s not as inexpensive as others like it—especially now with a chip shortage. But that’s just the point. The Galaxy ION isn’t like others. It’s QUALITY Samsung-built, and much nicer than the Galaxy Flex. No comparison. And it doesn’t hurt that the reliability of Samsung laptops has moved them up considerably.Again, this is the nicest (and brightest!) laptop I’ve ever owned. And the lightest. I can’t find much about it to complain about. And…it’s beautiful!",Samsung Galaxy Book Ion 15.6” Laptop| QLED Display and Intel Core i7 Processor | 8GB Memory | 512GB SSD | Long Battery Life and Windows 10 Operating System | (NP950XCJ-K01US),1291,samsung
2274,Josh,2020,5,Great for basic gaming!,"Pros:+ Extremely lightweight and quiet.+ Supports external graphics (eGPU) via Thunderbolt 3, meaning you have the ability to play modern games (but this will cost $300+ extra).+ Screen is GORGEOUS. Super bright, colorful, and everything you would expect from a Samsung display.+ Battery life is outstanding, but definitely activate battery saver mode and charge to 100% if you plan to be out all day.+ Headphone jack!+ Processor is plenty powerful to even do video editing/rendering with 1080p source material.+ Keyboard/trackpad is a joy to use and type on.Cons:- Track pad charging is finnicky and mostly a gimmick, but could come in handy if you forgot your cable somewhere.- No upgradeability options for the 13"". I would only recommend the 15"" because you can expand RAM/storage down the road.- Upgrading the 15"" is extremely challenging because of the small screws. I stripped mine and had to take it to a computer shop to replace them.- Weak sound speakers. Prepare to use headphones or listen in a quiet place.- No graphics card on the North American version. Asian version gets the MX250 GPU, which would have been nice to have that option.Beware: the Ion does not come with a dedicated graphics card. The onboard graphics (part of the CPU) is, however, fully capable of playing simple or older games (think PS2 or PS3/Xbox 360 era). I am able to play Rainbow Six Vegas 2 at max resolution (1080p) and medium settings at ~30 fps.However, if you want to play anything more recent or intense (like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare), you'll need to get an eGPU, which works well using the Thunderbolt 3 connection. It is an extra thing to carry around when traveling, but at least you have the option to carry/travel light, then play some great games when you are home.I recommend the 15"" version because it gives you the option to increase its internal storage/RAM. The 512 GB SSD goes very quickly. RAM is also very cheap these days, and you can literally double the RAM for only $30. However, if you have no desire to do much beyond watching video, writing e-mail, using Microsoft Office Suite, etc, the 13"" is plenty capable.Final thoughts: I have been a long-time Samsung fan, and I continue to be after buying the 15"" Ion. Any complaints I have are extremely minor and have a way of getting around them. I sold my 2015 desktop computer that I purchased for about the same price, and I wish I started getting into modern laptops sooner. The solid state storage is game-changing, and the laptop is plenty powerful enough to game if you buy an eGPU (I got the Sonnet Breakaway Puck RX 560, which is decent but I plan to upgrade that).Hopes for Samsung to improve the Ion 2.0: advertise it, add customizability options for North America, and include a dedicated GPU. Even if they change nothing else, I would be plenty happy.9/10 :-)",Samsung Galaxy Book Ion 15.6” Laptop| QLED Display and Intel Core i7 Processor | 8GB Memory | 512GB SSD | Long Battery Life and Windows 10 Operating System | (NP950XCJ-K01US),1291,samsung

I do not know what they used to determine the battery life but do not rely on this at all. Performance is okay, even for an i7, it is struggling against the Ryzen 5 4600U processor. Reason how I know is I actually have the ryzen machine and it is doing laps around this machine.Screen does look good. Sometimes too good. Samsung is always known to over saturate the displays on anything they make.  Speakers on the other hand are sort of...mediocre at best. At max volume, the sound sort of sounds hallow, not full and rich. Even though they state that it has been tuned by AKG, this speakers are terrible.

2323,Mercedes Rochelle,2021,5,Beautiful display,"When I opened the box I was horrified that it didn't contain a Toshiba. My old laptop lasted eight years without a glitch, though it's finally starting to fail. I wanted another Toshiba, though I didn't realize that Toshiba had been sold to Spark in 2018—hence the Dynabook. Once I got over my disappointment, I was very impressed by the quality of the monitor. It is sharp and brilliant. The keyboard is full sized, though the number buttons are a little narrower. The keys are all in the same place and you can click anywhere on the keypad to ""enter"". For some reason, the place where I put my hands is more comfortable than I am used to. Happily, it still contains a DVD player. It has 3 regular USB ports and one USB-C connector, only one jack for sound (when I plugged in my speakers it deactivated the microphone), the HDMI and Cat-5 connector. I was surprised at how small the Hard Drive was... only 256 GB. But the processing speed is more than acceptable and I don't save a lot of photos. I'm quite content with this machine.","2022 Latest Toshiba Dynabook Satellite Pro L50-G 15.6"" FHD (Intel Quad Core i7-10510U, 16GB RAM, 512GB PCIe SSD, NVIDIA MX250 2GB Graphics) Full HD Business Laptop, Webcam, Windows 10 Pro",899.99,toshiba
2324,BasicTek,2015,3,I had a Daunting wish list for a new laptop and Toshiba deilvered untill it started breaking!,"I got everything I wanted with this Toshiba and then some. On my list were the following...Intel I(3,5, or 7) processor at least 8 GB RAM, 14 - 15"" screen with at least 1920x1080 resolution, SSD (none of this hybrid nonsense and as far as I'm concerned the only reason laptops are coming with things like 54000 RPM drives, and wireless n, is to dump and overstock of now obsolete hardware). Anyway back to the list, a backlit keyboard, dual band wireless, touch screen, tablet capability (either flipping or detaching), light weight, good battery life, and the big kicker I didn't want to pay over $700 (really $500 or $600 was the sweet price). I had been on the lookout for many months maybe even over a year, and there were always a couple features missing or the price was extremely high (or more often both features missing like SSD and higher price). When this laptop finally came across my path it was on slickdeals posted for adorama at $699. It was my wife's bday and I didn't have the funds, but I keep searching for the model # to see if any other deals would come up while I found the money. Then a refurb shows up on amazon for $550 (bonus was a year free interest on my amazon card). Everything on my list was met or exceeded (best processor, more memory, wireless AC, very good reviews, just an amazing combination of hardware. Now I could remove a star for Windows 8.1 but will let that slide as 10 for free will be out soon. This laptop will boot from off in 4 seconds, that's really 4 seconds and you can start working, it's completely ready (I have tweaked it a little and removed some pre installed software), Even though refurb the one I got was indistinguishable from new and has no issues whatsoever, wifi is perfect (I saw some complain about that), the speed and performance of this laptop is extraordinary for day to day tasks. It's not being used for gaming so any video card limitations are no issue. Toshiba did a great job here and I wish more companies would package desirable hardware and not just obsolete junk they need to dump off on unknowing consumers. If they had more stars I'd give them. BRAVO Toshiba!!!!!To note: Reason from going from 5 stars to 3. About 8 months later (5 outside the refurb warranty) our touchpad mouse broke. While I wouldn't use a touchpad my wife couldn't live without it. I got a replacement on ebay for $12 and installed it easily in about 45 min. This may have been a bigger problem for folks that don't know how to repair laptops. I'm still giving it 5 stars for super performance and a minor low cost problem but others should take note this is not  the only mouse failure reported they are common. About 2 years later the keyboard has keys falling off and intermittently not working. the LCD display is leaking or something on the bottom so it is deteriorating (this may be form being bumped but there is no visual damage) Overall I reduced the rating to 3 stars because I've had too many issues with a laptop that rarely leaves the house. Still a powerful beast but seemingly a little fragile or not built as well as some other name brands","Toshiba Flagship 2-in-1 Convertible Tablet UltraBook 15.6"" Touchscreen Laptop P55W-B5318 - Intel Core i7-4510U - 12GB DDR3L Ram Memory - 256GB SSD Solid State Drive Satin Gold",449.00,toshiba
2325,mariolina,2016,3,"Defective keyboard, long wait for repairs, cosmetic damage by repair shop - Would NOT buy again","I chose this laptop for its great specs (at the time I bought it) -- a large screen, convertible format, USB 3.0 drives, a solid state drive, and so forth. At the time, there were virtually no reviews because it was brand new to the market. I had been signifcantly underemployed and even unemployed during the Great Recesssion and I've have been playing catch-up ever since, so this notebook was a significant expense for me, but I had to buy one because I had enrolled in a programming course. Unfortunately, I soon realized that the keyboard was defective, and I had to send it back to be repaired. The repair took over two months, so I wasn't able to use it for my course. I did manage to borrow a friend's underpowered laptop, but it was a huge inconvenience for both of us. When I finally got my repaired computer back, I immediately saw that the repair center had damaged the case. The damage was cosmetic, so I reluctantly let it go because I had already inconvenienced my friend enough. However, after skimping, saving, and waiting for something as long as I have for this, and even breaking my budget, and then not being able to use it for its primary purpose, the scratches just added insult to injury. The rule for buying high tech is to buy it when you need it, never in advance, because the capabilies will increase and the prices will drop dramatically. I feel cheated because I didn't get to use this for the purpose I bought it for when I needed it, and during the over two months of downtime while I waited for it to be repaired, better options became available at lower prices. I would NEVER had bought a laptop over two months before I planned to use it, but that's what happened. Not to mention that when you buy something new, especially when you are paying more than the average cost for that item, you deserve to receive something in pristine, perfect, new condition, not scratched up, as this was when I finally was able to use it.This has to rank as one of the very worst shopping experiences in my life.Final summary: After getting the defective keyboard fixed, this turned out to be a pretty nice computer, and I would have ranked it higher if it had worked as it should have out of the box, and if Toshiba's customer server and repair had been acceptable. More than anything -- features, speed, portability, and other factors, computers need to be reliable.","Toshiba Flagship 2-in-1 Convertible Tablet UltraBook 15.6"" Touchscreen Laptop P55W-B5318 - Intel Core i7-4510U - 12GB DDR3L Ram Memory - 256GB SSD Solid State Drive Satin Gold",449.00,toshiba
2326,Southern Gal,2016,5,Toshiba 2-in-i Convertible Tablet UltraBook rocks!,"This is my third Toshiba in a row, and once again I am not disappointed. However, this is my first experience with both a touch screen and a tablet, and having both in a laptop is pure heaven! I love the size, the [familiar-to-me] keyboard layout, the ease of operation, the perfect touch of the keyboard keys, the quick response of the touch pad, and the ease and convenience of the touch screen that operates on both the laptop and the tablet. And the 360 degree flip-and-fold feature provides five convenient modes: laptop, audience, presentation, tabletop and tablet. Awesome!  A couple of minor issues for me are the USB port on the left side is very close to the outlet for the power cord and it's a bit tight, and the cord plug itself sometimes comes loose and falls out on its own accord. I don't know why that is but I just put it back in. Neither of these is a big issue for me, just room for a little improvement in future models. Also, this my first laptop without an optical drive but I purchased an external drive for about $20 that works fine and meets my need. While it's true an internal drive is more convenient if you use it a lot like I do, it's really not a big deal to attach a USB drive that you can easily take with you. Buy one that is powered by USB and let the laptop run it without the need for electricity.Everything works well; the memory card reader is on the left, beside the USB port; two more USB and a HDMI port are on the right. The small power button is also on the left side. I overlooked this when I first got the laptop and asked for help from the community to find it. I wear glasses and it's pretty small and almost flush with the laptop frame so I missed it. Pardon my red face.  The screen resolution is bright and beautiful while the built in Harman/Kardon speakers provide good sound. The keyboard, complete with numeric keyboard on the right side, is laid out well for comfort and functionality. The backlight is the way to go: my last Toshiba had a backlight, and I will never again buy a laptop or computer keyboard without one. Again, I wear glasses and this is tremendously helpful to my vision as well as using the keyboard in poorly lit situations or in a bedroom, etc.  For some who have dissed Toshiba as ""junk"" I would disagree. I've had two Toshiba laptops in the past that have been real work horses and they were very heavily used. Both of them still work although memory problems [I have that too!], and generally outdated technology forced me to replace them. Other that that, I never had a problem or complaint with either of them. I had total confidence buying this Toshiba, and searched for Toshiba laptops exclusively in fact.  In summary, aside from the minor issues scarcely worth mentioning, I am extremely happy with this wonderful, lightweight Toshiba 2-in1, and I look forward to it giving me trouble free service for many years. So buy it and enjoy.","Toshiba Flagship 2-in-1 Convertible Tablet UltraBook 15.6"" Touchscreen Laptop P55W-B5318 - Intel Core i7-4510U - 12GB DDR3L Ram Memory - 256GB SSD Solid State Drive Satin Gold",449.00,toshiba
2327,Deborah L,2016,2,TOSHIBA 2 in 1 CONVERTIBLE TABLET DYING IN LESS THAN A YEAR,"I love the style of it. And it's heavy but I expected that because it's big. But I've only had it 1 year and 2 months and there are cracks in the bottom of the casing ON BOTH SIDES, right at the corners, where the sides of the bottom cover leaves the keyboard to leave a space for the USB ports on one side and miscellaneous ports on the other side. This is a CLEAR design flaw.  And now one of the control keys doesn't work. Ridiculous.I was so happy to get this as it looked like I was finally going to have a Toshiba where the hinges at the bottom of the screen didn't wear out LONG BEFORE the hard drive did. Even if that turns out to be true, I have a bigger problem. I'm getting blue screen crashes. The first one happened 2 months ago, maybe less. The computer started right back up and apologized for the error, so it didn't LOOK LIKE the blue screen crashes of old -- that signal that the hard drive is dying -- but now I'm not so sure.I think I probably should have contacted Toshiba when it first happened and got a replacement, because yesterday it happened again -- another blue screen memory error. The computer said it was going to restart after it reported something to microsoft, but it didn't. I pressed the start button and it restarted without any problems but I'm nervous I spent the best part of $1000 on fire buying this thing.If it goes in less than 2 to 3 years, I'm done with Toshiba. I put up with the cheap cases because the hard drives didn't die in the old laptops I had. I even spilled tea into one of them TWICE, it kept running. The thing that made me get rid of it was the hinge on the screen falling to pieces, just like the one before it, and the one before that.If this hard drive doesn't last, I'm done. I'm going to write to Toshiba. If they attempt to ""make me whole,"" as they say I'll write another update.","Toshiba Flagship 2-in-1 Convertible Tablet UltraBook 15.6"" Touchscreen Laptop P55W-B5318 - Intel Core i7-4510U - 12GB DDR3L Ram Memory - 256GB SSD Solid State Drive Satin Gold",449.00,toshiba
2328,Crimsoncascade,2015,5,"Great value, huge high def tablet, silent speedy laptop","I was extremely surprised by the value of this laptop.  I bought refurbished here on Amazon from Intent -- the item looks brand new and was insanely cheap.  First off, the laptop is completely silent.  No fan, no harddrive. Complete silence.  Second, I've been getting battery life around 10 hours, which has changed my life.  Third, while  the wifi reception is a bit poor [it doesn't reach into rooms that my other laptops will still get a signal in], I was pleasantly surprised by much better transfer rates than my other (recent model) laptops, so that is a tradeoff I'll take.  Third, ssd drive means immediate startup and other kinds of speed.  When I was transferring files using a 16gig USB stick from my last Toshiba (only a year old), my old Toshiba would take something like 10 minutes to copy the files onto the stick, while this Toshiba would transfer from the stick in a minute or two.  So I find everything VERY FAST.  Fourth, for whatever reason, this laptop worked out of the box seemlessly with my NAS.  Finally, I have various 7 and 8 inch Kindle Fire's, but when you fold this screen back, you have a whopping 15.6"" High Def Tablet.  I wasn't really expecting to enjoy it that much, since I use it mostly as a laptop.  I'll tell you that when I folded it back in a room of people on their phones and Ipads and Kindles, and I started looking through my photos and using an app or two, every eye in the room was on me, asking what I was using.  The only negative I have found is that because it's a fully high def screen, the default size of text etc. is pretty small, and my eyes aren't what they used to be.

2329,J. Starns,2016,1,"Worked great for three months, now it's a hunk of junk.","I purchased this laptop for work.  It worked super fast for the first few months.  Lightning fast.  Then about the 6 month mark, it started giving me warnings about the cooling system. I googled all the workarounds, tried a ton of things to help this error message go away. Shortly after that the fan would start up and be super loud.  Like a weed wacker outside buzzing.  I took it to a work meeting and people actually stared at me my laptop was so loud.  This is my first laptop, so I thought they just ""do"" that.  It would work great if I was on a remote server, but the literal second I went on line, just one page mind you, Facebook.  I wasn't gaming or anything, and the fan would sound like the machine was going to explode.  Now conveniently just after the 1 year warranty mark, the cooling warning system pops up and the fan won't even turn on.  Sometimes I can knock gently and it will slowly whirl on.  Some times prayer works, sometimes it just won't come on at all.  Matter of fact I am writing this review on my home computer and not my laptop, because it won't stay on long enough for me to leave a review.  It stays on for two minutes at a time. Very sad about this purchase.  I do not have $900 more dollars to buy a lap top every year.  It seems this particular laptop is basically disposable, as they did not build it to last past it's warranty.  Be warned, you will be disappointed in this lap top.  It will fail you when you need it most.  If I can save just one person from the heartache of buying this computer, I have done my job.  Now I'm back stuck at my desk just so I can get my regular work done.  Thanks for nothing Toshiba.  I will never buy your products again.","Toshiba Flagship 2-in-1 Convertible Tablet UltraBook 15.6"" Touchscreen Laptop P55W-B5318 - Intel Core i7-4510U - 12GB DDR3L Ram Memory - 256GB SSD Solid State Drive Satin Gold",449.00,toshiba
2330,DaveG,2015,5,Seems to Be the Beast People Say It Is,"Starting Out Well.  Others said it was powerful and it is not disappointing.  For comparison, I bought a high end desktop last year and had installed a large SSD on that and lots of RAM (and upgraded my download speed to 175 MB/s and a new 5G modem off ethernet) have been merrily enjoying that for some time.  This thing holds it's own in comparison, running with the same modem and wireless.  I run some pretty hefty stuff  - running VPN to work, graphics, 3D modelling, and some minor developing and I'm never waiting around for either machine.  I even installed Ubuntu in VirtualBox to run alongside it and am able to carve off 3 processors and 4 GB RAM to devote to that and don't notice any slowdown.  That's the positive side of this thing and it does not disappoint.I noticed that the speakers are half decent.  Though I haven't had much experience with it.The downsides have been pretty minor.  Toshiba installed a bunch of bloatware that was actually raising flags with the anti-malware software I normally install first thing.  It takes a half hour or so to clean up the machine.  I haven't quite got the hang of the screen orientation yet.  Sometimes I pick the thing up and it flips upside down virtually and takes a half minute to get its balance back.  The keyboard has different switches embedded in the normal key set to turn some things off so you can flip the screen into tablet mode and set it down on the keyboard.  So mostly these downsides are features not bugs.  I am hard pressed to complain about this and I'm difficult to please with my computers.We'll see how this fares with time.  I believed the positive reviews I read and so far not disappointed and have not encountered any problems.","Toshiba Flagship 2-in-1 Convertible Tablet UltraBook 15.6"" Touchscreen Laptop P55W-B5318 - Intel Core i7-4510U - 12GB DDR3L Ram Memory - 256GB SSD Solid State Drive Satin Gold",449.00,toshiba
2331,Dustin,2015,5,The perfect laptop,"WHAT... A... FANTASTIC... LAPTOP!This thing is super (and I mean super) fast. It turns off and on in a snap, loads everything faster than you can say, ""Whoa!"" and not to mention, IS A TWO-IN-ONE!!!The camera quality is better than any laptop I've seen so far (yet still a little grainy),battery life is great on this thing (I can pull an average of about 6 hours),the speakers... oh my gosh the speakers. They are the most fantastic speakers I have ever heard out of any portable electronic device. I'd highly recommend this laptop solely for the speaker quality,the display is amazing as it is Full HD (1920x1080),and has a perfectly lit back light.I guess my only complaint would be the bezels of the computer.When you try to open it, you have to push somewhat hard on the bezel of the display on top, meaning you will get hard-pressed fingerprint spots in that area; thought it could just be easily wiped off even with your shirt... just thought I'd point that out.But this laptop is the most fantastic lapto-... comput-..... electronic device I have ever purchased.Yes... I know... look at the price tag. No one is going to be happy blowing almost a grand on a laptop without really knowing how it performs beforehand.But I assure you this is the best electronic device I've ever owned, and greatly look forward to what it holds in the future for school and work. If you have the money for it, are looking for a fast, great laptop (a two-in-one nonetheless), and really want the most bang for your buck... look no further than this computer right here.

2332,Sullen7,2015,4,Good 2 in1,"I have been looking for a good 2 in1 laptop for awhile. Going through reviews, and checking the specs of a bunch of computers. The one that would fit what I wanted was the previous version of this Toshiba. The problem was the reviews for it said it had horrible wifi issues. I wanted a solid state drive too, so that added another problem. This version with a SSD came out, so I ordered it. I crossed my fingers that the wifi problem didn't come with this one as well. It all worked out!!! Great computer. Wifi works on the other side of the house and upstairs to boot. Touchscreen is responsive, keyboard keys are not mushy, and display is vibrant. Only downsides so far are that the trackpad doesn't respond quickly sometimes and its a little heavy to be used as a tablet. That last one might problem for some people, so go for the thinner Yoga (its smaller though). Asus Flip 15 was also on my radar. I picked this one, super happy about it.Had the computer for about two months. Its still pretty good. This update is about how the battery life is about five hours. No where near 10 hours like Toshiba boasts.","Toshiba Flagship 2-in-1 Convertible Tablet UltraBook 15.6"" Touchscreen Laptop P55W-B5318 - Intel Core i7-4510U - 12GB DDR3L Ram Memory - 256GB SSD Solid State Drive Satin Gold",449.00,toshiba
2333,Perplexed,2015,4,Perfect E-Reader for My Treadmill,"I already have a 15.6"" Windows 8 notebook so it was a bit of a stretch for me to purchase another one. The one I have has a built-in DVD drive which is pretty much useless and adds weight, and a 5200 rpm harddrive which slows everything down. I talked myself into purchasing this Toshiba Ultrabook as an e-reader for my treadmill. At 15.6"" with the font set to the largest setting, I can actually read while walking on a treadmill. When you think about it, Apple offers nothing close for the money. I would not be able to read an e-book on my IPad while walking on my treadmill and my Toshiba cost about the same as my IPad and the Toshiba has four times the memory. If you use Apple's pricing model that would be a thousand dollar IPad.My only complaints are that the space key does not always work and that the function keys activate PC features like Brightness instead of application features like Close application. I keep turning off the touchpad by accident. Really Toshiba, do you really think people need the ability to turn off the touch pad at the press of a button?","Toshiba Flagship 2-in-1 Convertible Tablet UltraBook 15.6"" Touchscreen Laptop P55W-B5318 - Intel Core i7-4510U - 12GB DDR3L Ram Memory - 256GB SSD Solid State Drive Satin Gold",449.00,toshiba
2334,Joshua,2016,5,Super long battery life,"Holy cow guys. This thing is incredible. Super long battery life. Incredibly fast. Perfection. It is very sturdy and durable. I hate windows 8 so I got 10. When I downloaded windows 10 it for some reason did not allow me to use Bluetooth anymore. I don't know how that happened (i probably deleted something i should not have while removing bloatware), but I just reinstalled it and made sure i downloaded all the updates for windows as well and it works flawlessly and perfectly now. I think bluetooth was a great idea. WOW GUYS THIS THING IS AWESOME! I am right now watching 2 large youtube videos, working with excell and IE, listening to spotify, and logged into facebook and this is not skipping a beat at all. NO wifi problems, i think it gets far better wifi reception then anything I've had before. Also I have had no keyboard problems at all either.UPDATE: Keyboard problems did arise. My number keypad on the right is acting up and the 9,6,and 3 keys do not work so far twice now. I bought this about 2 months ago, but all it has taken to fix is press the key that isn't work really hard, and restart the computer (WHICH BECAUSE IT IS SO AWESOME ONLY TAKES LIKE 6 SECONDS TO RESTART!!). Still in love. I think the keyboard thing though is a real thing but a system reading issue rather than a hardware issue.

I had completed the Windows 10 upgrade, and when I notified Toshiba of the touch pad problem they refused to fix it free of charge because of the upgrade.  They did agree to fix the space bar, but I was still in the return window, so I just returned it instead.  Fast forward about 4 weeks after receiving the new laptop (same model).  The new laptop's space bar is still ""sticky"" just not as bad as the first one's.  Now my screen has split open on the left side and the slit is getting bigger.  Because of the slit, the screen is not holding itself up well and is now falling backward while in use.  But I am outside the return window.

I bought this as an open box item from Amazon Warehouse and it blew away the Dell XPS that i had previously owned.  I use my computer all day everyday for work and transport it around on a regular basis.  The weight of the laptop is excellent compared to typical laptops of this size. It has a very thin form and fits well into my carry bag.  The touchscreen is very responsive and folding the screen back into tablet form works great and snaps into place nicely.  The keys have a nice response to them and the palm pad area is large and works well for people with bigger hands.  I was initially concerned that the addition of the number pad would leave the letter keyboard too small but that hasnt been an issue.The battery life is great and I even run the performance at its highest level available when not connected to power.

Got through that and then used Macrium Reflect (free version) to create the bootable USB drive and for weekly backups (we always think it will never happen to us and then one day it did years ago; learned my lesson!). Windows 8.1 was a nightmare even though I have used pcs for decades. So glad for the Windows 10 upgrade, which was free since this machine came with Windows 8.1. Very fast start-up and no lags,although I do not use it for gaming, just web browsing, work files, email, youtube, and video streaming.

I have barely taken the laptop out of my house, and so this damage has occurred through the normal process of opening and closing the screen.

Yet, when I received this tablet the start button was broken.  The only way to start the tablet was to use a small flat screwdriver.  What's worse is that when returning this to Dream Deal, the vendor, it was like pulling teeth and took two weeks.  Thank goodness amazon was finally able to arbitrate on my behalf and I got my money back.I'm not exactly sure who to blame for this defective tablet, but this didn't keep me from ordering another Toshiba.  Actually my new Toshiba is a better model, purchased through Costco.

2353,AJ,2015,2,great door stop. terrible for production.,I am not impressed. I have been using computers since text only. The keyboard works about 30% of the time. I did a complete system restore per Toshiba's instructions. The headphone jack is only mono output and is suppose to be stereo. When you move the damned thing if you touch the power button which is located on the side you lose your work. I spent many hours trying to fix this over last month. Now I am returning it to amazon. Just garbage IMHO. Will not be doing business with toshiba ever again. This is one of several faulty products I have purchased by that brand in five years. Really not happy. Computer is fast.

I have a Surface Pro 2, which I liked but the screen and keyboard size were too small for major computing. It was okay for traveling. The problem with larger laptops is poor batter life, and weight, not to mention slow startup times and spinning hard drives. This computer is like have the bet of all worlds. It's fast and easy to use as a desktop, great battery life (almost 8 hours), quick boot up, can be used as a tablet, and now running Microsoft Windows 10 that is amazing in it's own right.

2360,Lu,2015,5,Nice machine for the price. Speedy and good quality.,"Updated review after using the laptop for almost exactly a year: I really liked this laptop at first, but it's been terribly unreliable for the last couple months.The keyboard and trackpad randomly stop working... Windows pops up a ""do you want to enter tablet mode"" prompt because it thinks I've undocked from a docking station. The keyboard backlight stops working at the same time. Powering off and on again will fix the problem, but that's a nuisance.On two or three occasions, the laptop went completely dead - it shut off while in use (resulting in data loss), and wouldn't power on. Eventually I found hard-reset button that can be pushed with a pin.The WiFi connection drops frequently. I know it's not my access point because my phone and my wife's computer both continue to see the local network. To get the connection back, I can usually just disconnect and reconnect, but sometimes I have to disable and re-enable the WiFi device.And apparently Toshiba has given up on supporting their own products. There were a couple of threads on their forums about these issues, but they have deleted their entire support forum.I'm done with Toshiba.","Toshiba Flagship 2-in-1 Convertible Tablet UltraBook 15.6"" Touchscreen Laptop P55W-B5318 - Intel Core i7-4510U - 12GB DDR3L Ram Memory - 256GB SSD Solid State Drive Satin Gold",449.00,toshiba
2361,Eclectic Me,2015,1,"Great initially, useless after 90 days","Like many of the other reviews, the machine is a beast......when it works. Granted, I did get my warranty out of it, only for it starting to fail after. I also know computers do not last long (based on ever increasing technology), but I should have gotten more than a year out of this one. The main issue I see out of this computer as being the culprit is the design flaw. I have replaced the fan twice because the back is flimsy, and it kept bending the fan. After the third time, the extremely fragile components were basically falling apart (the ribbon and it's connectors). This review has nothing to do with the seller, just the company itself, and I doubt I will be buying another Toshiba anytime soon (if ever). I am not a professional computer technician, but I have fixed plenty in my day. One could say that I was too rough when opening the computer to replace the fan, but I did fix it fine the first two times. It really boils down to cheap parts and a bad design. I hate giving bad reviews, but in this case, I really think Toshiba needs to build better products.","Toshiba Flagship 2-in-1 Convertible Tablet UltraBook 15.6"" Touchscreen Laptop P55W-B5318 - Intel Core i7-4510U - 12GB DDR3L Ram Memory - 256GB SSD Solid State Drive Satin Gold",449.00,toshiba

Yes, lesson learned, it did quack like a duck.When I bought the laptop 8 months ago, I really liked it and thought I would be pleased with it. Unfortunately, it turned into the worst experience ever (like when you feel like smashing things). Many keys randomly stop working and I still have not found any solution to it. I tried online forums, reloading drivers and anything else imaginable. No luck. I even opened the laptop to confirm that the printed connector is properly connected--it was.Before then, I noticed that keyboard some times works when my palm does not touch the aluminum cover. Occasionally, when touching the metal cover, there is a ""feel of electricity.""

2374,Jamie,2013,5,"Just replaced my old macbook, great for daily use & handles the adobe suite like a pro","I have now owned this computer for over six months and can honestly saw what a great, portable and powerful product this device is. It's great for those who want a tablet but don't want the limited operating system. Here you get a full-functioning laptop with a decent sized touch screen (with amazing resolution) that folds down. It is bulky if you're comparing it to a tablet - but considering you're getting a very solid and full-functioning device, I really have no complaints and it's heaps lighter than my old macbook from 5 years ago. And considering it's capabilities, the price is very reasonable.My biggest fear with this device was the exposed screen, but I have no scratches or any sort of wear on the screen and it's super easy to clean. I just use my glasses cloth every couple weeks - as long as your fingers aren't greasy or anything from food or lotion, fingerprints are never really an issue. Back in summer I found the glare on the screen hard to use the computer sometimes in the bright sun, but nothing a shady spot didn't solve!I'll admit, I was skeptical of Windows 8 when it first came out, but I was fortunate enough to have a legit Microsoft employee show me all the features and how to utilize the operating the tile screen. I still am on the desktop 80% of the time, but there are some neat apps and shortcuts you can create on the desktop. It's also pretty fun to customize. But I really have grown to like Windows 8 (so long as you have a touch screen!). I'd recommend just watching some free demo videos and you'll be set. I really love splitting the screen between apps and using the sides to swipe in different functions and menus. It really becomes habitual once you get use to it and now I even go nuts when I'm not on a touch screen!Also, I haven't contracted a single viruses so far and took off Norton first thing (Norton really sucks up a lot of your computers resources, I suggest most people should just thoroughly uninstall it. Though they don't make it easy.) - and that's with being an avid download-er. I actually had a really annoying virus on my mac before that was horrendous to remove, so please don't fall for that myth that only PC's get viruses!The only real downsides I've encountered,-the hard drive has very limited space for my photography & design needs, but I just bought a 1tb passport hard drive with USB3 and I'm set. It is solid state, which really helps make the computer faster and more responsive, but the lack of internal space does bum me out sometimes.-Thought it's not a big deal for me, I know some people like to carry extra batteries and change them if they can't plug in their device. This has a relatively lower batter for today's standards (I can still get a good 4-5+ hours,even while skyping & editing photos) and doesn't allow you to remove your battery. Again, probably not a huge deal for most people, but just a warning to those who do like having back-up batteries.-The only thing my old macbook has going against this device it it's ability to pick up weaker WiFi signals. While it's often not a huge problem, if you're in a weaker WiFi zone, this computer will not want to connect sometimes. Once there is a connection though, it's great. I've mostly only encountered this while trying to access open networks while not in their respected buildings. I probably wouldn't consider this a huge deal, though I've noticed my mac picks up those signals without trouble, but the internet itself does tend to lag a lot.Overall though, I'm soon going back to school and I know I found the perfect device to do my work on and records lectures with (there's two cameras! One facing you and the other on the back of the screen). I carry my computer with me everywhere, so the portability of this device is great. I've had no problems with hardware or software malfunctioning. It's fast, very responsive and surprisingly powerful for it's tiny size! It also has a very slick design that is stunning and tough!I would definitely recommend it for someone wanting a portable, multipurpose device that's got the latest technology while still spending less than a mac! I was initially going to buy a macbook pro but just couldn't make it past the checkout with that price, ultimately I took the lunge and bought this. Never regretted it once.

2375,Amazon Customer,2013,5,Exactly what we were looking for,"Perfect form factor for my wife and I.For the record, I am a fan of Windows 8.  I upgraded my desktop to Windows 8 and had no issues using it.  After using Windows 8 with this machine, I like it even better.  Using this in tablet, laptop and tablet/laptop mode has been a pleasure.I looked and read about many of the new Windows 8 hybrids/tablets.  I really wanted to like the other options, but needed the laptop mode that this unit provides and didn't want to spend north of $1K to meet our needs.  I came across this unit at a local store and was marked (supposedly by mistake) as a similar price as the one on Amazon, but they didn't want to honor their price so I bought it here.I bought this machine primarily for my wife to replace my old HP laptop that died.  I set the machine up using only the touchscreen...didn't even slide out the keyboard.  My wife loves it and I even caught myself picking it up and using it more than her at first.Pros:- Has SSD hard drive.  FAST.  Starts up, sleeps, resumes, starts applications faster than my beast desktop (going to upgrade that to a SSD!)- Cool.  It doesn't get very hot like normal laptops with traditional hard drives (could be the integrated video card as well)- Small and light enough to be portable, yet large enough that we aren't squinting at the screen and wishing for a larger screen.- Battery life.  This machine seems to last a good 4+ hours...haven't consistently timed it, but I don't feel we have to look for the power chord all of the time.  We are able to use the machine, put it to sleep and use it for a couple of days.- Keyboard is backlit- Touchscreen is accurate.  I tried a few touchscreens and walked away from them after just a minute or two because of how frustrating they were.  This one just works.- It has a mouse touchpad that recognizes some gestures...I only played with the pinch zoom in/out so far and just learned that one while writing this review...Give me a break, this is primarily my wife's machine.Cons:- If this is you only machine of the house, the hard drive size in this unit might not be big enough (128 GB).  If you need to develop and need to install a lot of software, this drive would fill up fast.  Also, if you plan on putting your media on this machine, it will definitely fill up fast.- Video Card is probably the minimum you would want in a new machine.  I haven't noticed any particular issue with it, but spec wise it is low- The screen is always visible/exposed (It is Gorilla glass though).  If you need a hybrid that hides the screen when not in use, this is not your machine.- There is no CD/DVD drive...but do you really need one anymore?Overall, just a great machine",Toshiba Satellite U925T-S2120 12.5-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Ultrabook (Midnight Brown in Soft Touch Body),675.00,toshiba
2376,ECP,2013,5,"Functionally suits my purposes, so far...","Update 3/14/15: Reading the increasing number of 1-star reviews mentioning touchscreen and screen troubles and outages from ribbon failure or other causes (known and unknown) I feel very lucky now because mine continues to work so well. The included instructions urged slow, careful sliding on the hinge, I recall, and I will continue to change screen positions very slowly and gently, since this design apparently leaves vulnerabilities--or maybe Toshiba's quality-control is spotty as other suggest--or both. But I'm still very happy with mine and it has functioned reliably and adequately, so far. This doesn't feel heavy to me at 3.2 pounds and the relatively short up-to-4-hours battery life (which I knew about before I purchased, so I didn't subtract stars) serves me okay because I'm rarely far from an outlet, but ultraportables are getting lighter and lasting longer and when I buy another I will seek longer battery life and lighter weight.  Those thin buttons on the side are easy for me to feel and operate without having to look and I've gotten used to the smaller, stiffer touchpad too (didn't even try to adjust the settings, just kept working, growing accustomed, but I understand it could frustrate).Original review: Yes, the Touchpad is stiff and the On/Off, Volume and Screen-rotation buttons (on the left side toward the back, as I face the laptop) are tiny, as a reviewer somewhere noted, but these minor inconveniences haven't slowed me down yet. So, I'm unlikely to push any of those buttons inadvertently and the pad works well enough alongside the Touchscreen, which is suitably sensitive.Yes, the Touchscreen is highly shiny and becomes ""fingerprinted""--of course it does--like most tablets I've seen. Wiping it clear (using a lint-free cloth designed to clean eyeglasses) is easy enough.And yes, as tablets go this is rather big and heavy--but it's less awkward than I expected. I hope to take it traveling often.Also, this aside: Yesterday, when I fired this up, was my first-ever hands-on whirl with Windows 8 and I was relieved to realize I could catch on, pretty much, within an hour, though I don't consider myself terribly-techy. The hybrid nature of this little critter and/or Windows 8 must/might be partially behind the double-keyboard effect that distracts occasionally (that I read about somewhere), but I know my confused input, hit-and-missing while learning the new OS and getting used to switching between tablet and laptop modes, caused this weirdness also. Anyway, it's no big deal for me--easy to fix and move on.Right away I found the hinge mechanism sturdy-enough-feeling and pleasantly-surprisingly easy to work during mode-switching.The device is too new for me to rate at 5 stars and this 4-star rating is provisional (I didn't subtract a star just for the slightly stiff Touchpad and buttons or glare or smudge-proneness or any weirdness I've mentioned because that's all minor, in my view, considering my purposes); I'm still exploring the features and testing; and I will update this review with further details, probably.UPDATE February 23, 2015: Finally, I've added the fifth star. I'm still very happy with this and no problems have cropped up thus far.",Toshiba Satellite U925T-S2120 12.5-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Ultrabook (Midnight Brown in Soft Touch Body),675.00,toshiba
2377,Katy Dorfschmidt,2013,3,Still deciding,"I ordered this product on the eleventh of July, but didn't receive it until about the eighth of August - so I'm not quite ready for a full review...but here is what I think so far:The computer definitely takes some getting used to.  I was excited to get a machine with Windows 8.  I have a Windows phone and love the interface.  However, the interface on the computer is quite different.  I still haven't figured out several things.  Call me a dumb blonde, but I can't figure out simple things like how to close windows.  Not to mention the multiple hours it took me to figure out how to get to my desktop.  This really is a learning curve though, and I believe that as I learn, the Windows 8 interface could be fun to use.I have had some issues with programs that I typically use - for example, my epub and kindle readers that I use to read books I downloaded from sites such as Smashwords will not work on this computer.  The Kindle Cloud Reader doesn't seem to function the same, and the Kindle app won't import books from external sources as it did on my old machine which ran Windows 7.  This may just be something for me to figure out.I've also had issues getting multiple email addresses to work.  My phone has multiple email icons - one for my hotmail and one for my gmail.  I couldn't get that to work on this machine as it made me use an email address as a ""Microsoft"" email - so now my gmail won't work in an app.  Very confusing.  I ended up having to get a Gmail app through Pokki.  Again, I just need more time to fidget with things.A few other things I've noticed in the few hours I've spent dinking with the machine.  The touch pad is a little tricky to figure out.  Trying to learn how to right click is driving me nuts.  It's pretty touchy.  Also my screen is set to auto brightness, and it can never decide how bright it wants to be.  I know I could switch this feature off - but I like the concept of it.  It just seems to be strobe lighting - it can't find a happy brightness.I will definitely have more to report on after using the computer some more.  This is simply a preliminary review of my initial thoughts.",Toshiba Satellite U925T-S2120 12.5-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Ultrabook (Midnight Brown in Soft Touch Body),675.00,toshiba
2378,Gary Watson,2013,5,Does exactly what I was looking for.,"With the myriad of pcs and laptops out there to choose from, deciding which one is good is based on what a person needs. I love this ultrabook. I tried using a tablet ( iPad and the Thrive) before and quickly discovered I'm not a total tablet-person. But, I like the convenience of using a tablet for some things. What I wanted was a combination of both: PC and tablet. I was looking for something I could use on the train during my commute to work without having to lug my 17"" laptop around. I wanted a unit that would be fast, with an Intel processor, large enough screen to make it easy to work on (most of my use is work related, not playing games or flipping around on the internet) with a full keyboard ANd one that would make using the keyboard easy, especially when sitting on the train. With so many options out there for how the keyboard is handled (clamshell, rotating board, softouch cover keyboard combination, etc.) I found this design to be the best. I like that the keyboard slides underneath the screen portion when using it as a tablet rather than having one that is a detachable  or swivel screen, or more so, one where the keyboard flips backward and remains exposed. Unlike some of the reviews I read elsewhere about this unit, the case design is really not an issue. The keyboard does slide out easily making it very easy to use on the train. I have a backlit keyboard on my 17"" laptop and this unit has the same feature. Makes a huge difference when working in low lit areas. The screen is sharp so working on a smaller screen is no problem. It starts up amazingly fast, making it even better to get work done quickly during a train ride. This wasn't intended to be my primary PC or to replace my 17"" laptop, but to be an efficient and lightweight companion to a from work. And, as much as I am a Toshiba fan, I strongly recommend this unit to anyone who has similar criteria in selecting a laptop/tablet combo unit. Less expensive than the Surface, and while some have cited the weight being a consideration, I don't find it to be clumsy or heavy at all. I actually prefer the shape and weight of this to the iPad. Feels much more substantial when using it as a tablet, and I can't stress enough how great it is to be able to switch to using the keyboard in laptop mode by doing nothing more than sliding out the keyboard. You won't go wrong with this unit.",Toshiba Satellite U925T-S2120 12.5-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Ultrabook (Midnight Brown in Soft Touch Body),675.00,toshiba
2379,Amazon Customer,2013,5,Laptop is pretty neat,"As far as the laptop goes, I'm really impressed. It's built solid and I'm a fan of the laptop/tablet transformer thing. Backlit keyboard will come in handy I'm sure, and I'm well adjusted to the smaller size of the keyboard too. As far as Windows 8 goes, I wasn't a fan at first but it is growing on me. I don't do the social website stuff, but I'm always on Amazon, eBay, Netflix and stuff like that. The app screen is nice but takes getting acclimated too. But there is also the desktop mode that's easy to get to. I'm big on being able to manipulate my computer to get it how I want it, Win 8 doesn't make that simple but it is doable. I also bought this in anticipation of the Windows 8.1 update coming at the end of the year, so hopefully that will make Win 8 more enjoyable. This laptop is mainly for homework, e-mail, web surfing, and playing movies and it does all these things top notch.Update: 10 February 2014.So I'm about 8 months into the laptop and I was in love with it. I adjusted to the smaller keyboard and windows 8. I felt good about the touchscreen and everything. Then about 10 days ago, the screen would blank (like it just lost all power) when I pulled it into laptop mode. It was perfectly fine as a tablet. I could very slowly push it into laptop mode and it would stay on so I stopped shutting lid to avoid messing with it all the time. Closed it awhile ago to store it and that night the screen wouldn't come back on at all. Had to use hdmi port with my tv and a remote keyboard to work it. Talked with toshiba warranty and had to pay $25 for their shipping box (my choice but they ""Recommend"") so I have the best chance of repair. Depending how this goes will determine my loyalty to toshiba. Too bad.",Toshiba Satellite U925T-S2120 12.5-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Ultrabook (Midnight Brown in Soft Touch Body),675.00,toshiba
2380,Keichii,2014,1,First and last Toshiba Product. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.,"Absolute garbage. I am deeply disappointed by the build quality of this device. I chose this over the much better Surface Pro 2 and realize I have made a grave mistake.The keyboard is the worst keyboard i've ever used in my life. The finicky keys do not always register a keystroke because the force from normal typing is not enough for the bottom of the key to touch the contacts. This is especially the case for the space key. There is very little surface force that is transferred to the contact so trying to press the space bar by the edges will simply not work sometimes. Touch typing is very difficult.The battery life is very mediocre. Normal browsing and light media playing gets me up to nearly three hours max. Charging is lengthy and frequent. The fan is very noisy and I cannot even watch videos at a public place without getting strange looks.However, even above this is has to be one of the worst design faults i've ever seen in a laptop. Had this not been an issue, I would've easily overlooked its minor inconveniences. When the computer is converted to tablet mode, the top screen is pushed down and you pull it towards you to cover the keyboard. A small black ribbon is exposed to stress every time you do this. Over the course of a full year, this black ribbon has been slowly robbing my laptop of features. Most notably, after about three months, the touchscreen starting having problems with reactivity and sometimes didn't work at all. Five months in, the touchscreen failed to work at all. I decided to deal with it since I was in a computer-intensive class at the time and didn't have the time or money to get it repaired. Now about a few weeks ago, the integrated mic on the laptop had failed to work, albeit due to the same black ribbon. It does not work unless I angle it at a dangerous and awkward position.I have about a month left on my warranty. I have heard horror stories about particular customer service with this product and I hope I don't have to jump through too many hurdles to get this thing fixed.Three words. Do. Not. Buy. There is much better you can get with your money.",Toshiba Satellite U925T-S2120 12.5-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Ultrabook (Midnight Brown in Soft Touch Body),675.00,toshiba
2381,Gianfranco Orlando,2013,4,Great Ultrabook,"I've had this pc for one day and I love it. It is perfect for those users that need something in between for a windows laptop and a tablet.It is fast, processor and internet connection, even with many program opened and running in the background.There are only 2 things so far I don't like:- The HD is quite small. A 250 or 500 GB would have made these ultrabook perfect.- The front camera, with the LCD open has a limited angle because the LCD can not move upward toward the keyboard. This makes video call annoying when you have the unit on your laps as the other person can barely see your entire face.I would have given five stars and + easily if it wasn't for these two things.However, I recommend this PC and I will update this review in case of upcoming issues.",Toshiba Satellite U925T-S2120 12.5-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Ultrabook (Midnight Brown in Soft Touch Body),675.00,toshiba
2382,E. C. Graham,2013,5,Not gonna find a better convertible,"I went shopping for a convertible locally and came home empty handed.  From what I could see, convertibles almost always have some pretty big problems in their design.  Lenovo has the Yogabook, but it works by folding the screen all the way over so that the keyboard is exposed and upside down (they sell a case).  The guys at Best Buy says people are having a lot of problems with the hinges on the Dell.  On and on, you get the point.  This Toshiba is pretty sound in my opinion.  Some people aren't going to like that the screen stays exposed, but how is that any different from a tablet?  It has really good features for the money; it is quite noticeable in speed to have a steady state drive.  The technology also works as well as I think anything could work for Windows 8 at this point in Windows 8 development.  I like Windows 8, I don't understand the big knock on it, but maybe that's because having a convertible makes it so much easier to use.",Toshiba Satellite U925T-S2120 12.5-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Ultrabook (Midnight Brown in Soft Touch Body),675.00,toshiba
2383,Papaw of 1-2-3-4-5-6-?-,2013,4,Works great.,"Very different from a normal laptop, works great, but not having some type of protection for the screen is a slight draw back.  I used a 3.0 usb external hard drive to install most of my heavy ended programs and it works great.  This allows me to not fill up the 128 gig digital memory.  I also use an Anker 3.o USB docking station.  The entire system runs fast and smooth with two extra monitors (one being a flat screen TV).  Had no problems.  When going portable (unhooked from docking station) it is like having a very large tablet.  This is nice for watching movies, or browsing internet while watching TV.  The back-lit keyboard is really nice.  I recommend it.",Toshiba Satellite U925T-S2120 12.5-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Ultrabook (Midnight Brown in Soft Touch Body),675.00,toshiba
2384,Mindy Clarke,2015,1,"Disposable computer, dead within 1.5 years","Disposable computer. I bought this computer 2 years ago. I loved it. Occasionally, the touch screen would not work and I would have to restart. However, just around the 1 year mark, the computer developed Alzheimer's disease and began to forget parts of itself. It started by forgetting that it had speakers and a camera...but only in laptop mode, When you slid the screen closed,the devices appeared again. Then it forgot the touchscreen entirely in both tablet and laptop mode. Essentially, I had a regular laptop computer, which was okay. Toshiba was absolutely no help in trying to resolve the issues and had no explanation for why drivers worked in one mode and not the other. I eventually did a hard reset and the computer's performance tanked. The battery, after 1.5 years, lasted about 1 hour.Now I had a desktop computer. But I still had use for that. Today, however, after less than 2 years, the screen stopped working at all in laptop mode (but still works in tablet mode) and the keyboard doesn't work... since the touchscreen is gone, I have no input method, so this is now a big piece of garbage that I can't even give away because I can't get my personal information off of it. So, if you want something that may or may not meet your needs for the short term and you don't mind losing everything on it, then go ahead and get this computer.",Toshiba Satellite U925T-S2120 12.5-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Ultrabook (Midnight Brown in Soft Touch Body),675.00,toshiba
2385,Devon Weldon,2015,1,Not as good as older versions...,"Right out of the box I loved this computer. Windows 8 took a while to get used to, which is not anything specific to this computer. About a month into using it, one day in class the touchscreen just stopped working. I missed out on points because of it. After this recurring multiple times, I realized if I turn the screen off then back on, the touch screen comes back to use. Thankfully. I bought this in the beginning of Sept 2014. Now, March 2015, the screen will not even turn on. Right in the middle of filing my taxes. Spent too long reading through some paperwork and the screen went to sleep. Will not wake up again. Let the battery die, charged it, and tried again. Nothing. All I can get now is the Toshiba start up screen and then blackness. The cursor will move across the screen if you use the mousepad. Very disappointing! My last Satellite I bought about 9 years ago is still kicking! I thought I was making a good choice in this computer! :(As far as the seller, they are awful. This computer was sold to me as new. Meaning I should have a 1 year Toshiba warranty. Only I don't.

Wifi went from iffy on loading google's start page to streaming video with no trouble. I started using it constantly. Sadly, after a few months of this actual use, the display would stop working when I switched from tablet to laptop. A little jiggling seemed to fix it for a while (clearly some sort of switch inside was starting to fail). Now it doesn't work ever, no matter what position.

2388,Mikey Boy,2015,3,"good idea, poorly executed","The computer performs well in terms of speed and power. However, the weird way that the screen flips up and down is a big negative for me.

I don't like the way that the computer screen rotates landscape-portrait in the same way your cell phone does; when it goes from landscape to portrait, I have to fold the screen down to have it reset back to landscape.

Well we both got what we wanted....she got the tablet and I got the laptop to administrate. Sound is good, weight is light, lighted keys come in handy, and I can manage to keep her safe while online.

2424,TH,2014,4,Mostly Good ... So Far,"The laptop works well.  Using VMware Player I created a Fedora VM with 2 GB of RAM.  The VM response time is good.  SQL Server installed and is running good too.  Nothing flaky so far with the processor, motherboard or memory.  It has been running without any problems.  No replaceable battery but the laptop is half the width of a laptop with a removable battery.  My only objection so far is that the touchpad right click button is a barely visible continuation of the bottom of the touchpad.  And its difficult to click.  Toshiba obviously went back and tried to reduce the manufacturing costs and I dont mind most of the cuts except the touchpad buttons.  Engineering made that part too cheap and the buttons just dont work well.This comes with Windows 8 not Windows 8 Pro. The difference is that you cannot join it to a domain nor does it have the option to install Microsoft Hyper-v. Although that is a easy $100 upgrade to Pro. Office is not installed either so that is another $100.","Toshiba Satellite L55-A5284 15.6-Inch Laptop (1.8 GHz Intel Core i5-3337U Processor, 8GB DIMM, 750GB HDD, Windows 8) Mercury Silver",725.00,toshiba
2425,Klassy,2013,5,It is what we thought it would be....,"I bought this laptop for my wife who teaches in higher education.  She has to be on the computer a lot to edit papers from students to posting comments and grades through blackboard.  She has a lot of windows open at any given time and needs to work at a nice pace.  I needed something with a lot of memory and a good processor.  This computer seems to be the one that can handle anything that you dish out at it.  Many people on this site and other sites  talks about Windows 8 which has nothing to do with the computer itself.  Windows 8 is different I get it but it isn't the end of the world.  It gets easier after awhile.  This computer was rated very good in the Consumer Report magazine as a good budget laptop.  That kind of sold me. The only con is that is doesn't come loaded with Microsoft Office, which can be pricey but we get a discount working in education so it isn't a issue but it can be depending on your situation.","Toshiba Satellite L55-A5284 15.6-Inch Laptop (1.8 GHz Intel Core i5-3337U Processor, 8GB DIMM, 750GB HDD, Windows 8) Mercury Silver",725.00,toshiba
2426,Essmay,2015,1,Be aware,"I have spoken with two Toshiba representatives today in regards to my new lap top I purchased in November 2014. Satellite L55-A5284. The device started to have horizontal gray lines appearing across the screen. It started with 2, now there are 3. When I called the first customer support number 1-800-513-9578 FREE I spoke with a male representative who was very rude on the phone. He said I quote "" I am not asking you, I am telling you there is a physical damage to the device"" and proceeded to insinuate that the device was dropped or that something heavy was placed on the top of it, going as far as telling me that there is a crack in the screen.1. The screen is not cracked !2. The device was not dropped !3. There was never put anything heavy on the top of the device !4. The lap top remains inside the house on the desk for 98% of the time and few times that it was taken out, it securely traveled inside a bag.5. This problem started about 2 days ago and it seems to be getting worse.When I called the second customer service number 1-800-457-7777 FREE, I spoke with a female representative who tried to be very helpful but really could not do anything but give me a case number and tell me that some one will be getting in touch with me. I still have to receive a phone call or an e-mail.I am very disappointed with the product and even more with Toshiba's customer service. I own HP lap top that I had for 3 + years. My old HP computer didn't have any of the issues my new Toshiba device currently struggles with. Judging by my recent experiences with that brand I should have never considered switching to Toshiba!","Toshiba Satellite L55-A5284 15.6-Inch Laptop (1.8 GHz Intel Core i5-3337U Processor, 8GB DIMM, 750GB HDD, Windows 8) Mercury Silver",725.00,toshiba
2427,CeCe,2013,2,Not A Happy Camper,"I've had nothing but trouble with this product. Don't know if most of it is because of the horrible Windows 8 (now 8.1) operating system or the laptop itself, but I would NOT recommend buying this product. Although there is a full keyboard, I find the touch not particularly user friendly for older adults. I get frequent error messages that my wireless internet is not connected, which is very frustrating as I end up losing the web page I was on. Funny that this doesn't happen with my iPhone or iPad and didn't happen with my old Windows XP laptop. Windows 8 does not support Comcast email unless you go to it through Outlook or use the Comcast Xfinity website, which if I knew beforehand, I would not have purchased any computer with Windows 8. I do most everything on my iPad except some ongoing word processing projects that I need a laptop for. With the computer you get a one-month free subscription to Office 365, which took me a week to figure out how to access because the program and any documents you create are in the Cloud. I could go on and on but let it suffice that I am not happy with my purchase. My advice is to start saving your money and buy Apple products!","Toshiba Satellite L55-A5284 15.6-Inch Laptop (1.8 GHz Intel Core i5-3337U Processor, 8GB DIMM, 750GB HDD, Windows 8) Mercury Silver",725.00,toshiba
2428,CindyR,2014,1,Froze up within the first 5 minutes,"I got this laptop after seeing it at Staples for $75 more and they didn't even have it in stock. Amazon shipped it in 2 days, perfectly as usual.  Out of the box,  I set it up following the quick start guide and signed in only to see a blank gray screen.  I called Toshiba and could tell by their attitude they could care less and wanted me to pay for support.  Finally, after several on/off and reboots, it worked. Oh, and you cannot take the battery out of this computer, its locked inside.  When the screen came up I saw that Windows 8 is bizarre.  Microsoft is trying to be like Apple but it is not working for them.  Read about it before you get a laptop with it.  I have a MAC and I was used to Windows Vista.  Windows 8 is nothing like either of them.  I felt lost and although I am not an IT person, I can usually find my way around a computer.  So,  after this first night I thought more about it and called Amazon the next day for a return.  It was no problem to send it back.  I ended up getting a laptop with Windows 7.  Much better!","Toshiba Satellite L55-A5284 15.6-Inch Laptop (1.8 GHz Intel Core i5-3337U Processor, 8GB DIMM, 750GB HDD, Windows 8) Mercury Silver",725.00,toshiba

2491,LimonKay,2016,4,Upgrading from a previous Toshiba Satellite.,"After using this laptop for about two weeks now I feel confident in making a detailed summary.To start off, I'm someone who has been using another Toshiba Satellite (The p845t-s305) prior to this for 4 years and I've loved it dearly - it was the first laptop I purchased with my own money while working for it in high school. My previous one had a very nice silver finish that gave it a premium feel to it with lovely clear crisp Harman Kardon speakers.As for this laptop, I'm a full-time college student and an occasional gamer so I'm trying to supplement both when I purchased this.The laptop itself is pretty bulky, (6.2 lbs) can be a nuisance to hold onto if you're constantly walking through campus or work, also the 15.6"" screen is quite large, too large in fact to fit onto most university desks snug, if you're not careful you might actually drop it.The Harman Kardon speakers are not impressive at all, the sound is clear and crisp but not loud enough to actually give you a theater-like feel on a 4k display. My previous Toshiba Satellite speakers (also Harman Kardon) despite being a laptop $200 cheaper, they were so much louder.Although the 4k display is quite impressive, keep in mind MANY applications, programs, software haven't been integrated to work with 4k resolution as of date, so if you're like me you'll find playing some video games, and unbranded applications may be hard to look at as the text and windows may come out huge.The feel of the device is pretty cheap and the finish is nowhere near high quality, if I had to guess the price of this laptop just from appearances only without knowing a single spec of it, I'd say it's roughly something you'd find on the clearance aisle of Wal-Mart.Now with all the negatives aside, I am planning to keep this laptop as there as many positives to it as well.First and foremost, the back-lit keyboard is absolutely stunning. The battery life allows me to watch 2-3 episodes of Game of Thrones while waiting for my Japanese professor's lecture to end while she continues to rant about the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.The 12 GB ram is what really interested me in this laptop, that coupled with the intel i7 processor does make casual gaming a pleasant experience (League of Legends, Call of Duty run fine as long as you're not maxing out the settings, you'll get about 40-50 FPS). Don't expect this to run max settings without FPS drops and lags.The touchscreen is very responsive (the touchscreen on my previous laptop died after a year shortly so I'm still  a bit untrustworthy when it comes to this).Overall, for $700 you get a laptop with 12 GB ram, 1TB hard drive, intel i7 processor, a touchscreen with dual tablet mode on top of a 4k display resolution. Certainly beats your local BestBuy deal right?","Toshiba - Satellite Radius 2-in-1 15.6"" 4K Ultra HD Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 12GB Memory - 1TB Hard Drive - Carbon Gray",649.00,toshiba

2494,Bob,2016,5,"For the price, you ca't go wrong"," Hi There! This is a great Laptop and I love it. When I received this, I swapped the HDD to a OCZ SSD with the help of a professional. It is super fast and was working fine other than getting blacked out from time to time and then coming back to its senses by it self. But since, last week, I have been experiencing some sort of issue with the touch screen. All of a sudden few touch points start to appear on the screen and at times those points closer to the task bar self click n apps and start to open them. And at times, those points make the cursor point to lock on one of those touch points. Also at times it makes the screen zoom in and zoom out when we try to move the cursor arrow or touch the screen. Some times when you touch one of them points and move it around the issue goes away. The same happens when the laptop is restarted. but again those points start to appear after some time. I don't know how to make this stop. I'm hoping a software update will fix this issue. if anyone else had the same experience or know anything about this issue, please let me know how to fix it. I have also attached some images and a video clip for you to understand the issue.

2496,Savan,2016,3,display is nice but complicate to handle it,"Ok, I am going to try and explain to anyone who may be interested in buying this laptop why I feel it’s a good deal. Some of you really need to understand what a deal this is and why some people are having issues.I have had this laptop for a month now and I have not had any issues because, I knew what I was buying. You see, either a laptop or desktop will only be as fast as its slowest component. Yes, this thing has a great processor, lots of memory, great 4K graphics but, the hard drive is only a 5400 rpm. We’re talking 1990s technology, that’s why this laptop is so SLOW. Sure, it’s a lot of storage but, the factory installed hard drive, is not meant for speed. Also, seeing the hard drive is the slowest component, it can create some problems for all of the better components.Now, I went to Best Buy to check this thing out and theirs had the same specs overall except theirs had a 128gb ssd drive, it was fast but, they also wanted over $1, 000. So, I found this one on here for 7 something and figured by adding a faster ssd drive by myself, I could have a very nice 4K laptop for under $850. After I put in my new ssd drive, this thing flies, boots fast, files run fast, browsing is faster and no issues loading programs. Just remember to clone your factory drive to your new ssd before you swap them. Trust me I needed to load Office 365 before I got my new drive and it took 4hrs to get it loaded, what a pain.Plain English, you’re buying a formula one race car that has a lawn mower engine part that’s slowing it down, just upgrade the hard drive and own an awesome 4K laptop, It’s worth it. Even if you installed a 7200rpm drive in this laptop, it would still be worth it.","Toshiba - Satellite Radius 2-in-1 15.6"" 4K Ultra HD Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 12GB Memory - 1TB Hard Drive - Carbon Gray",649.00,toshiba

Very well constructed with the aluminum caseing but can be scratched so I suggest getting a adhesive case protected plus a screen scratch protecter. Very easy to setup especially if you already r using windows10 on another device. Also purchased the wireless display adapter for tv.s but an HDMI cord will work just as well maybe even BETTER because of no connection issues! So over all with the specs of this pc & the $ it's on sale for is something that is hard to come but.

Would black screen or enter recovery mode on every restart or opening the lid from sleep. And it's just soooo slow. Boot time is ridiculous. Opening Word takes 2 minutes. The only 2 things I installed on the machine were Chrome and Office. Even after removing the bloat and trying various 'speed up Windows 10' tweaks, no luck. Tried a reset twice with no luck. Now it refuses to enter Recovery mode, so I can't even delete my private data before I return it.

2533,Amazon Customer,2016,4,Great laptop overall,"This laptop is probably a little more than what the average college or high school student might need. I have to do a lot of data entry for work so the number key pad is a necessity for me. I also do a lot of split screen work so it really helps having the 15.6” display. If you run a lot of programs at once, I’d recommend this laptop considering it has a 12GB ram. Ultimately, this laptop is a good fit for someone who does a lot of multitasking, runs a lot of programs at once, and wants a computer with full functionality and a crystal clear display.I rate this product a four out of five stars. It has a sleek design, feels light weight yet strong, and has by far the best display I have yet to see on a laptop. The touch screen is a nice feature plus being able to flip the screen all the way around. I also like that the keyboard automatically lights up when you start typing or press a key. It times out after a little bit to help conserve battery life. For me, the 12GB Ram is a big plus since I have a lot of programs running at the same time. I can’t imagine I’ll ever run out of memory either considering it has a terabyte to work with. The battery on this laptop seems about the same as others I have used. It usually lasts 4 to 6 hours, just depends what you’re doing.  I’d also recommend a warranty or accidental drop plan if available. The whole bottom is sealed up so no replacing batteries yourself on this one.When I first got the laptop a couple weeks ago I had problems with the display driver restarting quite a bit and the touch pad for the mouse would become unresponsive at times. The computer has downloaded numerous updates since I bought it and all the bugs seems to have worked out since then.If it wasn’t for the problems right away I’d give it five stars. It’s very frustrating paying a lot of money for what I consider an above-average quality laptop and having performance and operating issues from the get-go. Overall, the pros definitely out-weigh the cons and I would recommend this to a friend. Just be aware you might have to do some updates before you get to use your new laptop with its 4K high resolution touch-screen display.","Toshiba - Satellite Radius 2-in-1 15.6"" 4K Ultra HD Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 12GB Memory - 1TB Hard Drive - Carbon Gray",649.00,toshiba
2534,John P. Cloninger,2016,4,and all has been great since. Just a warning about 4K displays,"I'm going to go four stars. I got a factory refurb from MicroCenter in Paterson, NJ, so I only paid $579. It was a huge risk, but it has worked out very well!It almost had to go back after a month because as I was removing all of that pre-installed software, and configuring all kinds of other stuff, I somehow corrupted Win10. But somehow I managed to get that fixed, and all has been great since.Just a warning about 4K displays...to get your settings to a tolerable compromise between icon size, font size, app size, etc. takes some time to fine tune. It can be very frustrating, especially when the OS was being fooled with a lot. I've landed at a happy medium.Battery life is awful. Know that in advance. That's probably what keeps me from saying five stars.I rarely use the tablet mode, but it's a nice to have in some situations. I think I've been in tablet mode around 2% of the time. I think of this more as a desktop replacement than a 2-in-1. I have a 10"" Verizon tablet, and so if I want a tablet experience, I go for that instead. Both fit in my gig bag just fine, so it's not a big deal.It seems like a risky purchase, but mine has been fantastic...I lost my last Toshiba after about six years of heavy use, including me replacing the HD once, the screen once, three keyboards, etc. That's not because the build quality was poor...it was that I smashed the screen, poured drinks into the KB, and just wanted a bigger HD. It's why I bought Toshiba again. I have the ability to do laptop surgery on a whim, so I'm not afraid.Recommended, but only for the right person.","Toshiba - Satellite Radius 2-in-1 15.6"" 4K Ultra HD Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 12GB Memory - 1TB Hard Drive - Carbon Gray",649.00,toshiba

2541,angelflower,2015,3,So-so.  Not worth the price,I read the reviews before ordering this item and noted that reviewers mentioned two things that I found concerning:  the mouse pad issues and the sharp edge of the computer.  Let me start by saying I am a loyal customer to Toshiba.  This is my 3rd Toshiba laptop - I loved my last two.  This one feels cheaper and not up to the standards of my last Toshiba laptops.  The issue with the mouse is SUPER IRRITATING!  It's happened three times while just typing these few sentences.  Basically you are typing along and suddenly you realize that the cursor has jumped and highlighted what you are typing and it is deleted.  If you buy this computer you will use CTRL-Z a lot!  The sharp corners are annoying but you can learn to hold your hands differently and then you won't get cut.  If you rest your wrists on the edge of the laptop you will have a sharp red indent in your skin quickly.  The big thing on top of these has really nothing to do with the hardware - it's the software - windows 10.  It proved to be a lot of work to get this computer set up and remove all the crappy software it comes with (windows 10 related).  Would I buy this computer again?  No.  Should you?  Just be aware of the mouse and edge issues. I haven't loaded a lot of other software on this computer - it seems slow often and does freeze up a lot.  If you can wait - wait on a new laptop with windows 10 until they iron more kinks out.  So overall - this is just an okay laptop.  If I had pad half the price of what I paid I might be happier.  It's just not worth the price in my opinion.,"Toshiba Satellite S55-C5274 15.6 Inch Laptop (Intel Core i7-5500U 2.4 GHz, 12GB DDR3L-SDRAM, 1TB HDD, Windows 10 Home 64-bit)",499.95l,toshiba
2542,Nicholas L.,2017,2,Underwhelming performance with overwhelming fan noise,"This is my 3rd toshiba laptop and I was a totally loyal toshiba customer until I bought this laptop. It is slower than my ~3 year old toshiba w/ an i3 that I bought at staples for $429. First thing I noticed was that this is absolutely the loudest laptop I've ever used! The fan roars like an airplane trying to take off, I tried adjusting power settings and following other solutions described by others who had the same problem, and it does help, but makes the computer slow. Next, within a few months, the audio jack stopped working and I had to buy a usb adapter. Yes, the sharp corners are not people friendly, If I lay in bed with the laptop propped up on my chest, I have to put a pillow on my chest so the laptop doesn't cut into my chest. This wasn't an issue with my previous laptops. The display is better than my old laptop, but I wouldn't say it's good by any stretch. Overall I'm pretty disappointed with this machine for the price, I thought I was getting an upgrade over my old laptop, but it just doesn't feel that way. I plan to dig into ways to optimize the performance of this laptop, but haven't gotten that far yet, and I don't think I should need to do that for something as expensive as this machine.","Toshiba Satellite S55-C5274 15.6 Inch Laptop (Intel Core i7-5500U 2.4 GHz, 12GB DDR3L-SDRAM, 1TB HDD, Windows 10 Home 64-bit)",499.95l,toshiba

2567,JT,2015,3,High value i-7 laptop with serious BIG flaws,"I bought this machine from Staples for $600 after rebates. This is my third Toshiba laptop in the last two years. The first one was the S50 i7 based, so I thought this one is at least better than the two years old S50. But I was not happy with this purchase after two week using it. Here is the summary:The GOODs:1. 12 GB of RAM: plenty for any use2. 1 TB of Hard Drive3. Bluetooth4. Back-lit keyboard (worth $20 upgrade)5. Better battery life (But come with performance downgrade)6. Windows 10 preloadedThe BADs:1. i7-5500u only has two cores: its performance is probably equivalent to the older generation i3 dual core processor. Noticeably worse than older i-7 quad core. This is one BIG disappointment for me: I did not do research on this new Intel processor family for laptop; trade off performance for battery life2. Materials and feel seem cheap; The sharp four corner edges are nightmareThe UGLYs:1. The fan is running all the time. And worst yet, it is VERY LOUD. To keep it down, it had to go to BIOS power control and turn off the Dynamic clock and the Turbo clock. After that, this laptop is quieter but rums VERY VERY slow: probably slower than my one year old dual core i3","Toshiba Satellite S55-C5274 15.6 Inch Laptop (Intel Core i7-5500U 2.4 GHz, 12GB DDR3L-SDRAM, 1TB HDD, Windows 10 Home 64-bit)",499.95l,toshiba
2568,Natasha,2017,2,meh.,"This computer does what you need it to do for the most part. I got this as a gift for Christmas in 2015 It is February of 2017, so it is a little over a year old now, and I am having a lot of issues with it. It never wants to connect to the internet. I have excellent signal strengths and I can have my Wii U running Netflix with absolutely no problems but this computer will not connect to the internet. It isn't consistent, either. I always get up and do the whole unplug/plug back in your router, which doesn't do anything! Eventually, I will give up and just use my phone and hope that it will connect again. (Thank goodness for google docs and drive!) The trackpad buttons click obnoxiously and feel incredibly flimsy. The edges of the laptop are pointy and sharp at times. The lid isn't the prettiest, but I think they are trying to imitate mac at some level; their computers always have a classic look after all. The lid gets scratched easily and I 100% hate the little letters on the lid!! They get caught in your laptop bag (if you have one). The silver letters will fall off and leave little black rubber stopper things. I was worried that something would pop that little rubber stopper off, so I covered it with a sticker. I am not a fan of stickers on laptops either, so I wasn't happy with that. On top of all of the other issues, the battery has decided to start breaking. I keep it on the charger all night so I have a nice charge for school and work, but it is always at 80% battery life even though it was on the charger all night. The battery has been draining faster, forcing me to carry the charger with me. While I was in class today I put it on the charger since it all of a sudden had 20% battery life; I got off work and went to my classes, which start at 1 pm and by 2 pm it was at 50% by 2:30 I was at 20%. So, something is obviously up with the battery. Anyways, when I connected it to the charger I got a message saying it cannot be charged. I got fed up and just shut the laptop at that point. I needed to show something to my professor, which I typed on Word not google docs due to my school's online system only being compatible with Word documents, and I had 80% again, this was at 2:45-2:50. Yes, the computer has a nice hard drive and powerful processor and all that, but I have found that it isn't worth the price. Spend the extra and get a mac or get one under  $500 that will be more reliable. This one replaced a laptop I got at Walmart for $250 and they gave me a $50 gift card for buying that laptop. It lasted 4 years! Price doesn't always equal quality material. If you need a computer for school related stuff, either as a student or a teacher, go for something else. I am not the best person with technology but I can manage okay on my own and this computer just isn't the best it could be for the price.","Toshiba Satellite S55-C5274 15.6 Inch Laptop (Intel Core i7-5500U 2.4 GHz, 12GB DDR3L-SDRAM, 1TB HDD, Windows 10 Home 64-bit)",499.95l,toshiba

2571,Amazon Customer,2016,4,Toshiba vs HP vs Samsung.,"After 4 years of using the Samsung laptop I purchased to use for college (at age 50), it literally caught fire on my lap. As such, I had to run to Staples on December 27, 2015 for some type of replacement. For $570.00 After rebates, I bought the HP 15T Notebook, It lasted exactly 3 days, on December 30th about 10PM is started flashing a bright blue screen and failed completely. Thankfully, Staples has a no nonsense 14 day return policy as I called HP support, and he informed me for a total of $94.00 he would repair the computer remotely. I explained it was 3 days old and The HP SUPPORT EMPLOYEE again told me it would be $94.00, only this time gave me an option, pay him or take it back to the store. I had taken the unit back to Staples, they gave me another of the same model, it lasted exactly 9 days and failed completely. Again, Staples had accepted the laptop back, and there was NO WAY I was taking another HP home with me. As such, I purchased the Toshiba Satellite 5274 and LOVE IT at this point. I am NOT a Gamer etc, I do NOT edit photos either. I do however, write College and Professional papers etc. This unit seems to run far faster than the HP's and is much better quality in my opinion. The Toshiba was 160.00 more than the HP, but believe me, the piece of mind that come with knowing I will not again lose another 22 page research paper makes the additional cost worth every penny.  This Toshiba is a good unit. I have been advised to steer clear of the basic entry level Toshiba's as they are having a dramatic issue with wireless convertibility. If I had access to another Samsung, the exact model that actually caught fire on my lap, I would have bought another one of those in a hot minute even with the out dated technology, that Samsung NEVER FAILED ME ONE TIME IN 4 years of college abuse.","Toshiba Satellite S55-C5274 15.6 Inch Laptop (Intel Core i7-5500U 2.4 GHz, 12GB DDR3L-SDRAM, 1TB HDD, Windows 10 Home 64-bit)",499.95l,toshiba
2572,Brian from Northern California,2015,4,Great performance for the price,"Bought this for my son who is pursuing engineering and wanted a laptop that could keep up with the programs he uses (Like AutoCad/Inventor3D) and maybe even last through college. Found this on sale at Staples for $599.00 right at the end of September. So, for the money I just couldn't pass this up. With the i7 processor, 12GB of Ram and 1TB HDD, this laptop has NO problems running any programs. At first we had internet connections issues which I think came from an update trying to install before we had the computer fully configured, but one call to Toshiba and they corrected the problem right away. Must say the Toshiba tech support was impressive! Only two negatives to report are 1.) The edges of this thing are sharp. It's part of the design which is nice but If you spend a lot of time on the machine it can become annoying. Especially compared to my other Toshiba P775 which has rounded edges. And 2.) This is not so much a negative or complaint as much as an observation; in shopping around I found the latest form of hard-drive in laptops are actually not a traditional hard drive at all but a form of FLASH memory. No experience with one so can't speak to if it's as great as they claim but for the same price or more you only get 15-20% of the 1TB capacity this has and if  Flash memory does turn out to be revolutionary then this computer could become obsolete sooner than I'd like. All-in-all I'd say I'm very happy with this computer and my son hasn't had any complaints either.","Toshiba Satellite S55-C5274 15.6 Inch Laptop (Intel Core i7-5500U 2.4 GHz, 12GB DDR3L-SDRAM, 1TB HDD, Windows 10 Home 64-bit)",499.95l,toshiba
2573,MJL,2016,3,Good value for the price but the external finishing sucks.,"I purchased this Toshiba from Staples because of the rebates available.  For the size of the hard drive and the memory it is a very good deal.  So far I'm ok with everything as far at the computing goes.  I had to fight with OneDrive to get it to stop trying to sync my files without my permission and I'm having some trouble downloading drivers for my older printers but I don't think any of those problems are because of Toshiba, they're Microsoft problems.  My only complaint so far is the edges of this laptop are very sharp and rough. While I'm resting my wrists on this thing its is digging into my skin.  I have marks on my skin and I've only been typing for about 15 minutes. The finish of this laptop seems a little cheap. I had a Sony Vaio before this upgrade and the finishing on that machine was much nicer.  I'm going to have to figure out a DIY way to smooth out the edges of this laptop or it will be unusable for long bouts of typing.","Toshiba Satellite S55-C5274 15.6 Inch Laptop (Intel Core i7-5500U 2.4 GHz, 12GB DDR3L-SDRAM, 1TB HDD, Windows 10 Home 64-bit)",499.95l,toshiba

I installed the software updates in the Toshiba Service Station and then needed to restart. The PC was unable to restart Windows 10 or diagnose the problem. After resetting to the factory settings (a long process!) I called Toshiba support. Their answer was that if their updates caused a problem, I should just ignore the Toshiba updates and hope I didn't have any of the problems the updates were supposed to correct! In addition, the 90 day warranty only covers the hardware and I would have to pay for help to correct any software problems- even ones caused by their updates!!!

2575,Dr. Victor S. Alpher,2018,5,Why a 5-Star Review?,"I will admit that I'm reviewing an older Satellite, that I purchased in 2011.  However, my experience with this laptop is relevant if you are considering a Toshiba laptop, i think.  In 2012 I took the laptop out of the country and used it rather extensively in the Ukraine (220V) very successfully.  I returned home, plugged it in and have had it out of the house only to take it to Best Buy to have some work done--expanding the Ram to 16 GB.  After 2 years or so, I was running at 8 GB and no one at BB could explain this, but it wasn't under warranty. They suggested that possibly one of the two memory slots, which were replaced so that I could have an 8 GB plus 8 GB = 16 setup, had failed. There was not way to easily check this out.What did I do? I went on eBay, bought two 8 GB DDR3 memory boards (I was assured any would fit) and prayed they would work.  They did not at first.  A little wiggling, more prayer, and I'm running at 16 GB now as desired. No, I don't run a lot of graphics, but during the day I tend to have a number of programs piling up without closing some....the AMAZING thing is that after I reluctantly accepted the Windows 10 64 bit conversion, learning it, and using a two different Canon printers (one couldn't be repaired) and various Canon scanners, I have never otherwise turned the computer off for any reason.  I am getting a message that my battery needs replacing, and it might...but on the other hand, as this did not come with a 5 GHz wireless plug in, so I am using an Ethernet connection now, this laptop is still running, in November of 2018!  I am using Malawarebytes for system protection, and a back-up hard drive.  To find a letter in my email written in 2013 is very easy. I have high confidence in Toshiba, and bought another one as a backup.  I dropped it in a way that it could not be repaired (my fault), I'm now testing a Lenovo with 16 GB as my replacement cutoff was $600--and the Lenovo came with a DVD drive, the Satellite did not.  I hope not to be reporting aging on my computer longevity for a long time.","Toshiba Satellite S55-C5274 15.6 Inch Laptop (Intel Core i7-5500U 2.4 GHz, 12GB DDR3L-SDRAM, 1TB HDD, Windows 10 Home 64-bit)",499.95l,toshiba

The website apparently did not recognize the serial number so another call to c.s. got me as far as someone will call me back, which no one did.  Waited another day, and started the whole registration process again.  They finally got the machine registered but someone will have to contact me later to start the warranty process.  No one called or emailed.I had an extra SSD laying around so I just slapped that in.  Toshiba was going to to charge me another $40 to get a recovery CD.

The laptop would blue screen and restart all the time. Outside of the 14 day Staples return policy, I was not able to return the computer. I dealt with Toshiba support and still over 4 months later do not have a working laptop. I was also charged a $159 fee for support from Toshiba to assist me for a computer under warranty. Toshiba charges the fee up front because they say it ""may"" be software related. After 6 weeks of Toshiba support working remotely on my laptop, they finally agreed to send the computer to their repair center. Got it back 3 weeks later with a replaced hard drive and again the computer blue screened and shut down on its own. Called back Toshiba support and they now charged me $59 for Mcafee software saying my Norton Utilities was the problem and I needed to use Mcafee because it was ""preferred"" security software. Once again the computer blue screened and again I was told to send it back to the repair center. Still no working computer after more than 4 months and paying Toshiba support over $200 for a computer under warranty? As for Staples, no help at all. I am a 20 year business customer of Staples and expected more from them as they should be able to leverage Toshiba for assistance and you would think they would want to prevent Toshiba from doing this to their other customers.

Otherwise this S55-C5274 has everything else I was looking for. Large 1TB hard drive, 12GB of ram, and the Intel® Core™ i7-5500U Processor with turbo boost (it runs between 2.4Ghz up to 3.0GHz as needed). This laptop boots really quick for my purposes, yes I could put in a 500GB SSD for a couple of hundred bucks and gain an even faster boot time, but for my needs this laptop is quick enough as-is.This laptop has dual band WiFi with 802.11ac, where the majority of laptops I considered were only 802.11n capable, so that's a plus.Another feature I was looking for was a backlit keyboard, this is a great feature when working in bed with dim lighting. As soon as you touch a key the entire keyboard back lights. The backlit feature times out after a period of no key press (about 12 seconds, but I think it is adjustable in settings).Also another plus, all three USB ports are USB 3.0, with one of them supporting ""sleep and charge"" where you can charge a USB device while the laptop is in sleep mode or OFF.There are only two things I can complain about:1. No HardDisk activity light. I like knowing when there is hard drive activity so you can tell if the PC is locked up or not during lengthy operations.  Why omit this feature? An LED only costs about 10 cents.2. The audio quality could be a bit better. It's loud enough and pretty clear, but could use a bit more hi-fidelity as bass response is lacking.So far I haven't had any issues with this machine. It's fast and I've had multiple tasks going with absolutely no noticeable slowdown.I'm still getting used to Windows 10, not a great fan of it yet, and of course had to remove some of the pre-loaded software garbage that most manufacturer's are putting on their products these days. First thing to nuke was McAfee Virus software among other non essential stuff.Once you clean out the bloatware and make a few tweaks to startup programs, this laptop performs very well.Would I buy it again? Yes. Would I recommend to a friend? Yes again.","Toshiba Satellite S55-C5274 15.6 Inch Laptop (Intel Core i7-5500U 2.4 GHz, 12GB DDR3L-SDRAM, 1TB HDD, Windows 10 Home 64-bit)",499.95l,toshiba
2579,Meg,2018,1,Has not held up well,"I got this model about two years ago, and it is now literally falling apart; the front of the DVD player fell off in my hand this morning. It had always felt loose ever since I got it, and today it just dropped right off the computer when I picked it up. The touch pad has never registered a right-click unless I jam it down. It occasionally decides not to charge, which would be less of a problem if the battery life wasn't so bad. As others have mentioned, the fan is constantly running and is super loud, and it tends to get very warm very quickly, to the point where it is uncomfortable to have in your lap. I'm not even a gamer; the most I'm asking this thing to run is Netflix.I had heard good things about Toshiba, but overall, I'm very disappointed. All of my prior laptops have lasted at least 4 years before needing to be replaced, but I feel like even one more year would be pushing it for this one. I'll be looking elsewhere when I need a replacement.","Toshiba Satellite S55-C5274 15.6 Inch Laptop (Intel Core i7-5500U 2.4 GHz, 12GB DDR3L-SDRAM, 1TB HDD, Windows 10 Home 64-bit)",499.95l,toshiba
2580,Privacy,2016,1,S55 is the worst laptop I have ever purchased,"The touchpad is defective.  It just stops working.  When you go to Toshiba Support to troubleshoot, it suggests you turn it off and then on again, using the F5 key.  Then you discover that the F5 key does what the F4 key label says it is supposed to do - toggle between the laptop and external monitors.  Several other really terrible design choices.  In addition to not working, touchpad is off-center on the devise.  To use the F1-F12 keys you have to hold the FN key down (in other words, rather than just hitting F2 to quickly edit a formula in Excel, you have to hold down FN-F2 - otherwise you turn down the brightness of the screen).  The edges of the laptop are sharp, so that when you are typing and you lean your wrists on the machine, the edges cut into your skin.  There are a lot of other issues, but I suspect they are Windows 10 related (which is a whole other issue).  I had a Toshiba Portege that worked well from startup 5 years ago until it got too small to use all the new bloated software, so I thought I would be OK buying another Toshiba.  BIG MISTAKE.

My first toshiba was an earlier version of the Satellite series and it lasted all through high school and most of my college career. This laptop however started falling apart the moment I purchased it. It came with a manufacturing flaw, three light spots on the screen from damaged pixels. Three months in there was a problem with the wifi chip. I called Toshiba to send in the computer however they wouldn't let me access my guarantee (Which I paid $50 for) without paying a crazy $116 customer service subscription. I ended up bringing it to a private guy and now I have to use an external wifi stick because he couldn't figure out what was wrong with the chip. I have owned it for eight months and the speakers are fading out, I can't lean the screen back past a 90 degree angle without the screen going blank. The keyboard has three sticky keys with one missing. Its a lot of expensive features in a cheap frame. Do not invest in this laptop and I am personally not buying anything else from Toshiba after trying to get through their customer service.","Toshiba Satellite S55-C5274 15.6 Inch Laptop (Intel Core i7-5500U 2.4 GHz, 12GB DDR3L-SDRAM, 1TB HDD, Windows 10 Home 64-bit)",499.95l,toshiba

I should have checked out the specs more carefully; it is really slow.  I had to disable all sorts of Windows 10 animations just to get it to the point where it was usable, but by then, I realized that my wrists were in terrible pain, as the edges of the bottom portion are all sharp and pointy.  The display is pretty terrible, though turning ClearType on helped some.  As of this moment, I am using the machine as a workstation, with an external mouse, monitor, and keyboard.  It's not ideal, but fortunately, I don't have to take it anywhere very often, and it is not my main computer; I only use it for web development.  Otherwise, my Mac is much better (though I'm frustrated with it as well).  Would I buy it again?  Absolutely not.  To be honest, I would spend the extra money and buy a MacBook.

2585,Robert Sala,2016,5,Great price for the specs!,"Let me start by saying that a lot of the negative reviews that I am reading have to do with the operating system (Windows 10) and it's updates. These same complaints I read them with other brands, not just Toshiba. Where does the problem rely? Your using Microsoft! Microsoft impacts the physical and virtual memory thus affecting the battery endurance plus the processor speed. Thus is why we also hear the fan really kicking it in order to keep the processor and video card cool. I left Windows and Apple years ago (10 years to be exact) and have been an avid user of Linux. Linux does not hog your memory, does not defragment, does not need an antivirus since there are no known viruses, trojans, rootkits, RAT's or malware than can affect the operating system. As a result, you get a behaved pc or laptop that maximzes the performance without impacting it's resources; the battery, ram, graphics card, hard drive speed, etc. I use Deepin OS and it makes this laptop run incredibly smooth. As to the person that said the screen looks ""glary"", there are thousand of pc's or laptops that come this way. If it makes you happy, buy an anti-glare screen protection like the cellphones and it performs a double feature. Thus Tishiba has a truebrite HD screen and that is a good thing! As to the person saying that the corners are sharp, really?! Give me a break! This laptop is NOoT heavy and it is beautifully finished. So there it is folks, change your operating system to your favorite Linux distribution and this laptop outperforms others for the specs and price!","Toshiba Satellite S55-C5274 15.6 Inch Laptop (Intel Core i7-5500U 2.4 GHz, 12GB DDR3L-SDRAM, 1TB HDD, Windows 10 Home 64-bit)",499.95l,toshiba

2591,Ricky,2012,5,Great bang for the buck!,"I used to be a notebook geek, through and through, and used to write write reviews.  So I'd like to think that I know a thing or two about laptops, but it's been a while, and I'll have to resign myself to the fact that I'm now a common laptop user, and by no means an expert.With that said, I'd still have to say that this is a great purchase.  I recently had to part ways with my trusty Asus EEE PC Netbook, which gave me almost two years of solid, dependable day to day use before showing some signs of being obsolete.  (Yes, seriously.  I used a netbook almost every day for 2 years and did just fine!)  I'm thinking about doing a lot more work on my laptop in my spare time, so I decided to opt for a laptop with a bit more horsepower.  More importantly, I travel a lot for work, and have a corporate laptop as well, so this would be the second laptop I'd carry with me on a plane on a week to week basis.  Thus, I needed something thin, light, and somewhat robust.  After doing what I thought was a reasonable amount of research, and agonizing over all the models I liked in my shopping cart, this Portege was the last one standing.  So far... I'm impressed.  I'll try to make my points a bit more succint:Competitor models that I agonized over:- Asus Zenbooks- MacBook Air- Lenovo U300/U400 seriesWhat I like:- Thin: It's no macbook air, but this laptop along with my 12"" HP work laptop both fit into the one laptop compartment in my laptop bag pretty comfortably.- Light: It's surprisingly light, for it's size.  It LOOKS a lot heavier than it feels.- Battery Life: It keeps fluctuating, but after a few cycles of use, it seems to over somewhere between 6-8 hours, with the lowest screen brightness and moderate internet and word processing usage.  Update - It took about 30 minutes to write this review, and now at 90% it's still saying 7 hours 50 minutes....- Optical drive: I know it's a dying media, but it's handy if you are like me and like burning dvd's/cd's for backups every so often.- Tons of ports: Haven't tried them all yet, but this was a big factor.  I wanted a MacBook air, but hate the idea of having to order extra cables and carry them around, just to use ethernet.  (Yes, I still use ethernet every so often to plug directly into some routers for testing/setup purposes)- Full HDMI and VGA: No mini HDMI, or no adapters needed to get video out, unlike Apple/Asus.- Minimal bloatware: None of the factory installed software has been too annoying or pop up like so far, except for the Norton reminder.  I'm going to uninstall it and install AVG anyway.- Big hard drive: I'm just not somebody that lives in the cloud, and can't make do with a limited size SSD drive.  Fine, SSD is fast, but I don't have huge data transfer needs... just on the go storage needs.- Fast: Everything is functioning pretty snappy right now.  Windows loads quickly, opening the lid resumes it from sleep mode quickly, logging on is fast.  The 4GB of RAM out of the box is just fine for now and will probably need an upgrade in 1-3 years (I hope!).- Keyboard size: Chiclet keys are spaced well enough, to still allow dedicated buttons for home/page up/end etc.- Quiet operation: For average surfing and documentation, the fans stay in fairly quiet mode.  Rendering multiple videos can get the fan to kick in, but it's not overly loud.What I don't like:- Build Quality: It looks nice, but feels cheap.  Super plasticy.  That said, applying pressure to the back of the screen doesn't seem to cause any distortion to the screen- Mouse pad: Clicking sound of the buttons sound plasticy, cheap and hollow.  Also, the mouse pad surface, is more rough than the palm rest.... explain?- No backlight: I know, I know.  It never said there was one, and I knew that when I bought it, but when trying to use it in bed yesterday while my wife was asleep, it was kinda hard to see the function buttons, especially when I've never used it before.- Volume: Volume is modified by pressing the FN + 3 or 4 keys, but no on screen display for volume control.What could be better but I can learn to ignore:- Keyboard: The keys are kind of slippery, and feels weird, but you get used to it.  Sounds a bit clickety clackety, but it's not bad, and you can get used to it.  No issues with mistyping.- Chrome hinges: They look kind of plasticy too, but look ok from a distance.  If you read the reviews, and THIS is your biggest concern, then you might need to rethink what you're looking for.  Also, I think complaints about weak hinges are unfounded.  My screen is holding pretty steady, and I have to give the laptop a good shake to get it to move.- Screen: 1080p videos can be rendered, and look ok, but the screen doesn't POP.  Definitely not a gamer or digital media buff's dream screen, but for day to day use, it does just fine.  I wish it wasn't glossy, but so far I haven't really had any issues with glare.Overall verdict: I really wanted a MacBook air or a zenbook, but at nearly $600 cheaper, the Portege has almost all the same features, and is thicker, but still manages to be incredibly light and somewhat portable.  It's a favourite with PCMag, provides lots of out of the box features, looks good from afar, and is perfectly functional.  My last three laptops have been Asus, and I had some cash to blow on a laptop, but when you compare the Feature to $'s ratio, this laptop clearly comes out on top.

2592,Peter Marinari,2012,2,Quick computer not suitable for those who work and play hard,"The Toshiba Portege R835-P94 is a Windows laptop that is fine for wireless productivity in your home or on the occasional business trip, but it is not made to stand up to daily wear and tear of a heavy user. It's a pity, because it's a fast, efficient machine.BACKGROUND:I previously owned an indestructible, tiny SamSung NetBook, but after three years of using it 8-12 hours a day the keyboard was finally giving out. I am a HEAVY user, and while I'm not rough on my electronics, they do need to survive constant use and the jostles that come with a daily urban commute. I needed something light, portable, and sturdy that would allow me to be productive ALL DAY and EVERYWHERE - on my couch, riding the subway, walking to meetings at work, at lunch in the city, and between sets with my band.Four months into my purchase and I have many regrets, but depending on how you use a laptop you might not have the same turnoffs as I do.THE GOOD:Right out of the box, the Portege R835-P94 seems as though it is a decent MacBook Air competitor. That's not why I purchased it - I'm not a Mac fan - but when I held it next to my wife's Mac the form factor and weight were a close match, even if this machine is much more plastic-y.This Portege comes right up to the limit of what I consider portable. Any bigger and it just wouldn't work in tight situations like airplanes. While heavier than NetBooks, this machine is still very lightweight for its size.First and foremost, I think the battery life is stellar. On a relatively bright, high-functioning battery setting I can get 6-8 hours. It's rare that I ever run out battery unexpectedly and - if I do - it charges fast.Second, it is quick. It boots quickly, hibernates intelligently, and shuts down in a flash. I used it for a week with the installed RAM for internet, word processing and spreadsheets, video, and minor image manipulation with nary a moment of slowdown. An easily removed panel allowed me to beef up the RAM in two slots - not necessary, but easy to do with ",Toshiba Portégé R835-P94 13.3-Inch Laptop (Magnesium Blue),"2,333.00",toshiba

2594,DaveM,2012,2,Avoid Toshiba computers,"!)The machine is decently ergonomic, with a full-sized keyboard and a slightly off-center track pad with two click buttons. The function keys make sense, and a guide to them overlays onscreen when you press function. I do object to the Page Up and Down buttons being relegated to a vertical row on the side rather than being nested on either side of the up arrow (which is available), but that's a personal preference.The screen is really bright and clear, though it does glare at some angles and on darker content due to its gloss finish. The CD/DVD drive is a lifesaver, and I marvel at how they managed to fit it in.I was relieved to find that the computer has hardly any junk software I associate with most major laptop brands. Aside from standard MicroSoft programs, there's not much of anything pre-loaded. If you haven't used Windows 7 before, it is transparent. It has not once gotten in the way of my daily use, and in some instances of hunting for features or settings I think it is a considerable improvement over XP.THE BAD:Despite all of my likes of this machine, they cannot overcome the fact that the build quality is cheap. Yes, that makes it light, but it's not worth the trade-off!My left hinge fell off within my first day of use. I can push it back on, but it has never fit snugly. The battery locks fell out the first time I set it down sharply on a counter at lunch, and never went back in the same. The hinges are weak, allowing the screen to swing with any small amount of momentum or a strong breeze (I'm not joking!).A few keys are already missing my keystrokes. They just don't depress and rebound fast enough to keep up with my typing - I switch to a desktop to write anything lengthy, which defeats the purpose of having a laptop! Also, the trackpad is beginning to show signs of failure.However, my major complaint is the hard drive. I have had complete hard drive failures within the first 100 days of ownership of every Toshiba product I've bought in the past year, and this laptop was no exception. My old NetBook survived being accidentally punted down a shallow set of stairs and all of the other abuse of three years of daily use. This computer? Three months and a dead HD, right in the middle of my work day - no punts! I replaced it with a Solid State ",Toshiba Portégé R835-P94 13.3-Inch Laptop (Magnesium Blue),"2,333.00",toshiba
2595,Dave D,2012,2,Computer problem - bad support,", which I recommend doing RIGHT AWAY if you decide to purchase it. It was as easy to install as RAM, and it only took about two hours to load the factory settings from backup DVDs (which you have to make yourself or order for an additional fee).This machine can be loud. Not at rest - the fan is audible, but not annoyingly so. I read other reviews stating the mouse buttons were loud. This seemed like a trivial complaint to me, but they really are! No matter how gently you click, they make an obnoxiously loud KERTHUNK. The chicklet style keys are also rather clacky, and extremely squeaky since day one (even with a dab of WD-40). The DVD drive is incredibly loud - I think prohibitively so if you plan to watch anything. Also, the computer weirdly emits a loud chirp every so often - I assumed this was the hard drive, but it continues to do so even with the SSHD installed.Another minor complaint - there is no on-screen overlay when you raise or lower the volume with function keys. I thought for sure something was broken until I Googled it! The sound is decent for a laptop - loud, but no bottom end.Finally, while glossy finishes make for attractive electronics, they also mean you are constantly wiping away dirt and smears. It's no big deal, but if you are the kind of person who needs your electronics to look elegant and spotless this might not work for you. The screen shows smudges very quickly, so keep a microfiber cloth handy in your case.BOTTOM LINE:This laptop is probably heaven sent for lighter users who simply want something that will keep them surfing and productive when they need a connection. If that's what you want, I cautiously recommend it - though, I do endorse springing for the solid-state HD.My complaints are those of someone who LIVES on a laptop. It's where I work, play, and create. If you're like me - who uses a machine morning until night, who juggles it between meetings and writes thousands of words a day - the Portege is just not ready for the task. You'll be shedding plastic pieces, wincing at the loud and squeaky keys, and praying the HD doesn't fail between cloud backups.I can tell this is not going to last three years - it has already broken in at least three ways in four months!

2596,Alex Papadimoulis,2012,5,A Wonderful Almost-Ultrabook,"If you want a compact and lightweight laptop that doesn't compromise on functionality and still looks great (and doesn't cost an arm and a leg), then this one's for you. I've been carrying around a 15.5"" Sony Vaio for the past 2.5 years--don't get me wrong, I love that chunker--but it got pretty beat up, the battery life was absolutely horrible, and I dreaded having to lug it around in my backpack all day for classes (I'm a full-time college student). So I started looking for a replacement. Buying the Toshiba Portege R835-P94 was one of the best choices I've made in purchasing technology. Here's my breakdown of the pros and cons:Pros.1. It only weighs 3 pounds! I can do curls with it on my weak arm for ten minutes and not feel a thing. (well, maybe that's exaggerating, but it's ridiculously light!)2. It's gorgeous. The exterior looks black in low light, but every once in a while I'll catch a glimpse of that ""magnesium blue,"" and it makes me happy. Not to mention the slight texturing on the cover makes it look even better.3. The thing fits into my purse. It's nice not to have to take my backpack somewhere just because I'm bringing my laptop.4. Battery life! I haven't actually sat down and timed how long it can last, but I do know I can watch a 2-hour-long movie, an episode of The Office, and work on a paper (all in high brightness and volume) and still have a solid 40% left. I can't even describe how wonderful it is to take it out for the day, use it during classes and in the student center, and not have to take the power cord with me. It's fantastic.5. The touchpad. My Vaio didn't have multitouch, and it had some funny texturing on the touchpad. But this Toshiba's touchpad is glorious. It's smooth and super convenient, and it doesn't jump at all when you try to move the mouse.6. Speed. It's very fast--I haven't had any issues whatsoever with trying to download things or access ""busy"" web pages.Cons.1. Smudges and fingerprints. Because the laptop's a darker color, dust and oils show up on the keys and cover a lot easier than they do on a lighter shade. But of course you can clean it off regularly if that bothers you. It's definitely not worth passing up this baby for.2. Microphone placement. I like to Skype with friends and family, and I was a little annoyed to find out that the microphone is located on the front right corner of the laptop base right next to the SD slot. It's easy to forget it's there and accidentally rub over it with my wrist when I'm multitasking with working on a project and Skyping, because then the noise kills whoever I'm talking to. Not a great idea to put that there.3. Speakers. They do their job, but I can tell the difference between these speakers and my Vaio's. These just sound kind of hollow, and the quality's not fantastic. But hey, they work.So, yeah. That's what I have to say about the Toshiba Portege R835-P94. All in all, I think it's a fantastic laptop for the price. I'm very happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend this laptop to anyone!",Toshiba Portégé R835-P94 13.3-Inch Laptop (Magnesium Blue),"2,333.00",toshiba
2597,Ken McWilliams,2012,5,Very good laptop & value,"Update as of May, 2015. The thing is about shot. Very disappointed with service life. Crashes frequently. DVD player no longer works. Next computer will not be a Toshiba.Update as of Dec/2012- I am not as happy as I was with this purchase, but still consider it to be a good value in this product area.Reasons for lowering my initial review:1. Fan runs almost continuously. This has gotten to be an area of huge annoyance for me. I havent really tracked this from the beginning, but one day a few months back I was working and noticed the fan never really stopped. Now, of course I notice it all the time. Had I known this was going to happen, I probably wouldnt have bought this computer.2. Battery life has dropped significantly over time. I would say it's down 40% from when I first started using it.Bottom-line- if you are really using the computer to work,like I do, you might keep on looking, and the fan noise will drive you nuts eventually.Do still love the low weight though!Update as of 04/20/2012-  still extremely pleased with this computer. The Bluetooth was really easy to install and found my cell phone the first time (I have had trouble with other computers). Bluetoothed serveral pix and found the transfer was faster than normal.I have had this computer for a week now. So far I am really happy. It is very light (I have to carry two LT's)and it fits well in my backpack. The battery life is excellent. I have used it on battery for about 5 hours and it was down to about 1/3 charge when I plugged in.I also liked the fact I could delete some of the factory installed software-completely. I get sick of all the pop-ups begging you to activate their software. I have had computers where this was impossible (for the average user) and had to live with these popups.There is not a lot else to say. I am a 'light"" computer user (no gaming, or high tech uses) The applications I do run (MS) open quickly so,  plenty of memory (4-GB) and the 640 GB hard drive will store all my picures and videos. As I said, I travel a lot and take pix and videos as mementos.I recommend this PC to anybody who travels a lot and needs a personal PC to take with them. It is an excellent value for money!One note- if you get one, also buy a padded sleeve to protect it. Being so thin means it is fairly fragile and evidently (reading other reviews Toshiba is pretty firm on their 'damage' policy- if you break the screen you might as well throw this one away as the screen replacement will cost as much as new computer. just take care of it and you shouldnt have any trouble)Good luck!",Toshiba Portégé R835-P94 13.3-Inch Laptop (Magnesium Blue),"2,333.00",toshiba
2598,Ronulus,2012,5,FIRST DAY OUT OF BOX...FREEZES OUT OF HIBERNATION,"After purchasing this laptop for my daugher for college, at first we were quite happy with it.  She used it for about two months.  However, just a few weeks before school was to start, it developed a problem wherein the computer would shut off when disconnected from charger - as if there was no battery at all, even though it showed 100% and charging.  When talking to a support person, it was concluded that I would have to return the computer to them for repair.  They told me it would be in the ""Depot"" for 7-10 business days.  I explained the need to have it back quickly because of college starting.  It fell on deaf ears, because he said it will still be the standard 7-10 days. They sent shipping materials and it was sent back the same day. Well, it will soon be a month now, and their repair status page showed that the repair was completed, and that it was being prepared for shipping.  After hearing and receiving nothing, checking back on the status page showed that the computer was back in repair again.  There is no way of contacting them about the repair, either by telephone or by email. All they do after several telephone prompts is refer me back to the repair status page.  I will never again purchase another Toshiba product.  Buyer beware... if you have a problem, don't rely on Toshiba to fix it.  My daughter has been at college now for two+ weeks, and without a computer thanks to Toshiba.  Who knows how much longer it will be.By way of update... after contacting Toshiba by way of their website feedback (the only way I could find to send them a message), they did respond and informed me that the computer did not pass the testing phase and had to be sent back to repair - and they were waiting on parts.  This is the kind of thing they need to keep their customers ""in the loop"" about, but failed to do so.  A lady there named Julie personally looked into my case, and I think sped things along.  Bottom line is that the computer was returned in good working order.  From the day I shipped it to Toshiba until the day I had it back was 1 month and 1 day.",Toshiba Portégé R835-P94 13.3-Inch Laptop (Magnesium Blue),"2,333.00",toshiba
2599,BGS,2012,5,Great Computer....Great Value,"I had been doing the desktop *and* laptop thing for about 5 years now, the idea being that a laptop was just not a suitable replacement. And then someone told me about the Ultrabooks. Wow. Highly portable, grown-up computers (as opposed to the toy netbooks) with a crazy battery life. For real?But the more I looked into Ultrabooks, the less I liked: * I want real, full-sized ports. VGA, HDMI, Ethernet. I don't have time for adapters, and I don't want to be that jerk who goes around trying to borrow someone's adapter. No one likes that guy. * I like a removable battery. Maybe I'll want to buy a spare, or a giant aftermarket protuding battery that I won't need. I want options. * I don't want to carry around or have to borrow an optical drive. The world isn't all USB Thumbdrives, don't kid yourself. It's an extra expense and you'll just end up carrying it with you when you travel. And again, you'll be the jerk without the optical drive. * I don't need fancy-pants beveling and sleek looks. I don't have time for that, either. I spent all my fancy-pants time writing this review.So then I found this computer, which is an almost-ultrabook. I bought a 128GB SSD, 8GB upgrade, a USB3.0 Dock, a spare adapter for home, and BAM, now my life is even more awesome. I even got a man-purse/satchel that I carry it around it.Few other points...I did the fresh Windows 7 Pro thing, and found it was a little bit of a hassle finding the drivers, but it almost always is (especially on newer computers that haven't made it to Windows Update yet), so no points loss for that. It's the price you pay for no bloatware.The small screen and keyboard took a little getting used to, but it's fine. I have a keyboard/dock/mouse at work, and use it at home, planes, hotels, etc. with sometimes a mouse. Works fine.",Toshiba Portégé R835-P94 13.3-Inch Laptop (Magnesium Blue),"2,333.00",toshiba
2600,Dennis Berthold,2012,5,Incredible Value and Functionality,"I haven't had this one very long, but after installing some high end programs (Adobe CS-5 suite, Corel Draw X5, Video Studio pro, and MS Office) and running them, I am very pleased with the results. No problems at all installing or running the programs. I loaded and edited eight high res photos in Photoshop with no problems. The small screen doesn't give me the view or capabilities of my 25"" monitor & desktop computer, and I would not like to do any serious graphic design work on the Toshiba, but for what it was intended for, it does very well.If you would like to see more reviews on the Toshiba R835-P94, look at the Toshiba R835-P81, it is the same computer except the P94 also has Bluetooth and is over $100 cheaper. The P94 is an Amazon exclusive, which probably accounts for the lower price. The P81 comes with 6 GB of ram while the P94 only has 4 GB. The 4 GB of ram is fine for most applications and most users, but I like to max-out my ram. I bought two 4 GB high speed ram modules (a total of 8 GBs) for $46 and the P94 is noticeably faster. Installation of the ram is very easy.A real shocker was discovering that the battery power lasts almost as long as advertised. Amazing! I have never had a laptop that even came close to this one.I'm not a ""gamer"" so I can't speak to its capabilities in that arena, but I have watched streaming movies, and DVD's with no problems. The only negative things that I have noticed so far are that it has a narrow vertical viewing angle. I'm comparing it to my old Sony Vaio which has a larger and very good screen. The other negative is the ton of bloat ware programs that Toshiba loads on the computer. I doubt that you will ever use the majority of them. Sadly, it seems that all of the manufacturers are doing this now.Overall, the Toshiba R835-P94 is very good computer for the price. Small, light weight and good power.",Toshiba Portégé R835-P94 13.3-Inch Laptop (Magnesium Blue),"2,333.00",toshiba
2601,cstomr,2012,4,Overall Good,"Good= Lightweight, long battery life, doesn't overheat, no loud fan, nice mouse pad, FN buttons for easy setting adjustments, good keyboard layout (the keyboard doesn't sound loud to me as some people have mentioned)My one complaint: When the computer comes back from sleeping, the lighting is horrible. It whites out all of the text and the colors don't show up normally. I have to switch between the balanced and eco setting a few times to get the color and lighting to come back to a normal look again. I have yet to figure out if this happens when I'm in the balanced setting or the eco setting, or even both. Either way, it's not a big deal because it's easy enough to push down the FN button and F2 several times to rebalance the lighting.Overall, I would recommend this laptop. It's a good price, and besides that weird lighting thing, the rest of the specs are just what I wanted and the laptop works great.",Toshiba Portégé R835-P94 13.3-Inch Laptop (Magnesium Blue),"2,333.00",toshiba

I travel a lot & needed a light weight computer for business that had lots of memory & was fast, so I settled on the Portege'.Pros:  It is fast, was easy to set up & get started, is light weight & keys are a good distance for my typing. Great price!Cons:  The hard drive & fan are a bit loud at times. The CD drive is so loud & vibrates when there's a cd in there that I have to hold my hand on the computer while its running to quiet the noise. The overall look is a little chinzy but I feel that's the sacrifice for the light weight. The keys & the touch pad & control buttons are a bit loud.Overall this is a great laptop, but had to give it 4 stars for it's cons.",Toshiba Portégé R835-P94 13.3-Inch Laptop (Magnesium Blue),"2,333.00",toshiba
2603,Kj,2012,4,Great Travel Laptop,"Got this R835-P94 as an full-function alternative to an ultra laptop or netbook for a trip to Jamaica and general use afterwards. Worked great in all regards, battery life is super, quick for all Office Pro and Photoshop/Premier Elements use. Bluetooth & WiFi connections no problems either, and good sized hard drive too - the 2000+ pics & videos we took didn't put a dent in it.Was concerned that the screen might be too small as I was used to a 17"" laptop and desktop screen size, but not a prob at all for me.Only downsides were the glossy screen which I knew about going in and the chiclet keyboard which I did not.Only thing I would have liked was a backlit keyboard because I did use it at night and my touch-typing hadn't come up to speed with the chiclet keys, but this had everything else at a good price.",Toshiba Portégé R835-P94 13.3-Inch Laptop (Magnesium Blue),"2,333.00",toshiba

I have replaced the 640GB HDD with a 256GB SDD, and upped the memory to 8GB. I really like the face recognition software...though I'm glad I can still remember my password.  Other pros: very light, very sleek, and I love the 9-hour battery.  YES, it really does last up to 9 hours, which is good when I have so many meetings I take it to.

It's a pretty speedy little workhorse, even loaded with pictures, music, and games.I did recently upgrade it to have full ram, but I've had this for several months as it came in the box and it worked just fine straight from the factory.

My wife adopted it immediately and gave me her 5-year-old pentium dual-core 6-pounder with 1 hour of battery life.The only issue we ever found was that sometimes when the screen brightness changes (due to power-saving settings), the display becomes fuzzy for a little while.  I'm not sure whether there is a different optimal pixel configuration at different brightness settings, and something is out of sync.  The fuzziness disappears after a minute or so.With a laptop like this, there is no reason ever to buy a netbook.

The cold boot and the warm boot (from its sleep mode) is fast.Definitely need improvement:1. Keyboard was a big downer. It definitely require improvement. It needs a lot of energy to type. Considering that this was the main input device, this was disappointing.2. The screen is not a matte surface. When you turn it on, you can see your reflection. I personally like matte display.

So it depends on what you are buying it for. If you want a powerful and dependent laptop that will last you a while, I will always recommend Toshiba.

This may cause the screen to crack if a pressure applies to screen when lid is closed. Basically if you carry your laptop in your bag, screen may crack because it may bend.Maybe mine was defective or it is designed like that, but I was expecting an ""even"" fit when I close the lid.Before you buy check the stores to see if your comfortable with overall look and and design.",Toshiba Portégé R835-P94 13.3-Inch Laptop (Magnesium Blue),"2,333.00",toshiba

2641,Nia Bwell,2015,5,For Some Reason Mine Has Touchscreen?,"I'm very happy with this laptop. I waited up all day yesterday waiting for it to come home. I enjoy playing games and wanted a powerful laptop to handle games like Ark: Survival Evolved and World of Warcraft. So, I am happy to report this laptop does a very good job of doing that.It's a very powerful laptop. The strongest I've ever had was a 4RAM, and of course that's not enough to play some of these heavier games which require a lot of room. And with 1TB of space I finally have the room to download what I need without having to store it on my external hard drive. So, there's a plus.As other reviewers have stated they keyboard can be a bit iffy. This honestly depends on a personal preference. The keyboard is a little shallow. Each key is ""separate"" in a with it's own little space. I personally believe this is a good design since it can help prevent the keys from getting dust and other gunk in them. Even so I had ordered a keyboard cover ahead of time. The keyboard does light up when you start typing on it which I thought was pretty cool. I type a lot and I have to keep reminding myself I don't have to press down so hard on the keys when I type.Even so, I don't mind that much. I use an external mouse and I did invest in a usb extender for this laptop. There are three usb ports, but two are on the right side while one is on the left. I would suggest getting a usb extender at the very least for this laptop. Especially if you like to backup a lot of files or are using this laptop for work and play. A decent one only costs like $10 if that. It's a good investment and can save a lot of frustration later.My only thing I found odd is that for some reason the one I received includes a touchscreen. I thought this was odd and thought on the packaging this was just a mistake. Nope. The Toshiba Satellite I received is indeed touchscreen. This doesn't bother me since I don't care either way. I rarely use touchscreen as it is and had wanted a laptop without it just to prevent smears on my screen. However, it was a nice little surprise regardless. So maybe they updated the laptop to be touchscreen?Regardless, I love this powerful laptop. Sound is excellent on it. It has bluetooth. A few things you may want to invest in for it though are: USB Extender, Keyboard Cover, and a decent set of Bluetooth speakers if you want your sound really loud (or headphones.) Give this laptop 5 stars. It's the first one I've ever bought on my own. I love the Toshiba brand.Update 10/12/2015: Computer still works great. The sound for this computer is not quite as loud as I would like it, but good enough for watching Youtube or something. Putting in a pair of headphones or having a decent bluetooth speaker does the trick too.","2015 Toshiba Satellite S55-B5280 High Performance Laptop, Intel Core i7-5500U(up to 3.0GHz), 15.6-inch HD Display, 12GB DDR3L, 1TB HDD, Windows 8.1",565.00,toshiba
2642,Putputt,2015,2,Not too impressed.,"Okay, so I've only had this laptop for a few days, and I am returning it because I think I was unlucky enough to get one with connectivity issues. Ever since Day 1 it has a bad habit of disconnecting me for a few seconds and then reconnecting me. None of the other laptops or gadgets in the house is doing it, so it's definitely not a modem issue.Aside from that, which again, is probably just my bad luck, I haven't been too impressed or disappointed by this laptop. There was something weird that kept happening the first few days, which was that whenever the computer went to Sleep mode, all my windows would close. Firefox, Chrome...they'd just close, as though the computer had been shut down. What's even weirder is that it stopped doing that after about 3 days or so. There were also other things...like when I changed the desktop wallpaper, it changed back to its old wallpaper automatically. I had to change it several times before it stayed. It's really strange as these are not issues I have ever had with any of my previous laptops. I have no clue what happened there, but it's one of the reasons why my first days with the laptop were so rough.I haven't bothered installing any of my games on this, so I don't know how it performs gaming-wise. I have noticed the laptop becoming warmer under my wrists when I open Google Docs, which is surprising because I didn't think Google Docs is that demanding. I am currently using the laptop in Norcal, but I live in the tropics, so it worries me that it's becoming warm in Norcal weather.On a more superficial level, the laptop looks fine when it's open, but when closed, it is really ugly. This doesn't bother me much, but it's maybe worth pointing out. :DAll in all, for the price, I'm not too impressed with it. I think there are better laptops within the price range out there.","2015 Toshiba Satellite S55-B5280 High Performance Laptop, Intel Core i7-5500U(up to 3.0GHz), 15.6-inch HD Display, 12GB DDR3L, 1TB HDD, Windows 8.1",565.00,toshiba
2643,Ricardo,2015,5,So far the best laptop I've ever used,"I think this is my first review ever on a purchase at Amazon. So far (1 week) I am very happy with this laptop. First I have to say I had my concerns over buying a ""like new"" item. Well, it was really like new, and I mean new. The laptop had even the original plastic cover on the screen.Regarding the laptop per se, I bought it for my wife who work as a graphic designer, and I just can say that the laptop exceeded our expectations. It is very fast (it is a 12 gb ram pc), very quiet and by far much less heavier that my old laptop.In some reviews I read that there some issues with the keyboard and the touch pad. In that department, we don't have any complaints yet. The keyboard itself is very responsive, and it is very quiet when you type, also I like the fact that is has the numeric pad just like a regular PC keyboard. The touchpad responds also very nice, it has some cool functions like zooming just like the touch screen of a cell phone, but then my wife it's going to be using a mouse so the touch pad wasn't even an issue.I will try to write an update after using the laptop for some time, but so far so good...... Update  as of 08/12/2015Still loving the laptop. Upgraded to windows 10 a few days ago.

2644,That One Lady,2015,4,"Fast, Relatviely Light and Thin, A Few Downsides","So I should start by saying I really like this laptop. It is quite fast, great battery life for a full size laptop, and seems to handle whatever I throw at it quite nicely. It's kind of large for the screen size - when it arrived I thought I had accidentally purchased the 17"" but it's just that there is an inch or so extra on the left and right sides of the keyboard. Not sure why they made that choice, but it's been fine after my initial surprise.The system feels pretty solid although I have noticed a bit of flex in the top (display) when I am walking around with it. The keyboard has a nice feel, and the touch pad is responsive, good overall. My one quibble with the touch pad is that clicking is quite loud.Overall, so far it has performed exceptionally well, especially for the price point.The main reason it isn't getting 5 stars is something I didn't think through until it actually arrived. The battery isn't user-replaceable. Which makes it almost a disposable laptop when the battery starts losing life or dies. That said, I am still pretty pleased with the speed and build quality.","2015 Toshiba Satellite S55-B5280 High Performance Laptop, Intel Core i7-5500U(up to 3.0GHz), 15.6-inch HD Display, 12GB DDR3L, 1TB HDD, Windows 8.1",565.00,toshiba

2681,Karen RH55,2015,1,Buyer Beware...,"My old computer finally died after 10 years of continuous use. I did my research and homework and finally decided on the Toshiba. My husband had a Toshiba for over 10 years as his main computer at home and it served him well. I liked that when I took it out of the box and turned it on, it did not boot to the Windows 8 screen... I am looking forward to Windows 10 coming out later in the month.The computer has been easy to set up and move all my files from my other computer without any problems. Looking forward to using this computer.REVISION TO MY REVIEW AS OF October 14, 2015After using the computer since July 15, 2015 the keyboard stopped working. I spoke with Toshiba about the problem since it was within the first 90 days of ownership, I contacted Toshiba about the problem. Before they would talk to me, I had to purchase the 'Premium Protection Plan' to the tune of $159.95.. The tech attempted to fix the problem on line, however that didn't work. I was transferred to a higher level of tech and they wanted me to send the computer back to them. I had to pay an additional $30 to get a box and shipping label to ship it back to Toshiba. I purchased the box and they sent it to me via FedEx... I boxed the computer up and sent it back on Monday, October 5, 2015 and got it back, supposedly repaired on Friday, October 9, 2015. I got home from work, opened the box, read the report about they were able to 'duplicate the problem' with the same results I had reported. They replaced the keyboard cable and my computer was repaired.' I took the computer out of the box, plugged it in, turned it on, logged into my account, and that's as far as I could go. After entering my user name and password, The keyboard would not let me go any further than logging in. When I attempted to check my email and write responses,it would not allow me to go any further. I called Toshiba back to let them know the computer was not repaired, their answer was for me to send it back to them again, and they would 'try' to repair it again.I know this wasn't a very expensive computer, however, I did expect it to work for more than a few days. I used my old computer daily since 2005...and I am typing this update on my review on my old computer...It's slow and old, but it still works.I opened a chat dialog with Customer Service at  Amazon about the problem, explained everything to them, they offered to give me a refund on the computer. I sent the computer back to Amazon and will now look for another computer...

2682,Amazon Customer,2015,5,Exceptional for the Price,"This is an exceptional laptop for the price. I would say this computer offers real value--you could pay $200 or more and get less performance from other laptops.I see some people write negative reviews because1. - Mouse pad did not work and2. - WiFi dropping. I initially had both these problems, then I read the manual. Both of these things are controlled by the function keys, and when I discovered that, all my problems went away in about 2 seconds.As a low-end laptop, it has the Pentium chip, which was the standard just a few years ago. The Pentium is a great workhorse and is especially good with the 8 gigs of RAM this computer comes with. I use MS Word and PowerPoint extensively on this laptop and performance is excellent as you would expect. I am still using software from a few years ago, notably Photoshop CS4 and InDesign CS4, and they run as fast as ever. I also run audio recording software, and I have no problems with recording or playback.This laptop also streams Amazon Prime and Netflix videos just fine. The screen is not full HD (1920 x 1080), but it is sharp and clear and most people will be more than satisfied with the resolution and color of the regular HD (1280 x 720) that this screen displays.Any drawbacks? I could hope for a better keyboard. It works as expected, but takes getting used to. If I were to use this laptop to replace my desktop (unlikely), I would plug-in a full sized keyboard. It takes no effort to plug-in both a standard keyboard and big monitor, so that is a possibility.I'm a computer guy and have put this laptop through its paces.

Did not experience any of the negative experiences that people had mentioned.  Started solid, no issues, updated windows 8.1...(which was installed)..used Toshiba's utility to update needed drivers.....and I was off to the races. No issues with network connection dropping out. Listened to iheart radio for 2 hours without any delays what so ever. Laptop is plenty fast enough for the processor and ram it has. Would be more than enough for most college students. Plays Minecraft smoothly, ( always a plus..LOL) for those boring hotel stays.Movies and steaming video look great on it. Windows 8.1 is a learning curve, if you've never use it.

This is a sturdy laptop with the ""normal"" amount of bloatware (which I removed through Control Center).  I also removed free trial programs which hound you with pop ups.  This unit has less than most I've helped people with.  The keyboard seems solid.  It was a great value for the price.  I'm not thrilled with Windows 8 (had to hunt for the system modifications), but you have to go with the times.  My grandson doesn't mind the system placing his photos and downloads.  Oh, and it comes with MS Office.  I also loaded two of the top freeware anti-virus programs and removed Norton, which is a trial version.

Naturally, Windows 8 sucks.I guess what I'm saying is that I wasn't expecting a high end computer for the price...

Opened it Friday night, got all the settings just the way I wanted it, and settled in to play some  games. I'm very good with computers, and did not do anything to harm the hardware or software. Unfortunately, the next morning - less than twelve hours later - I logged onto my computer and in the middle of typing, some of the keys stopped working. E, T, Y, U, I, O, 1, 2, and the right 8 key, to be exact. If you Google this problem, many other users had the same issue, often with the same exact keys. The suggested fix is to take out your battery and put it back in. However, this requires unscrewing your computer and will void your warranty. Computers should work properly straight-out-of-the-box. I returned it, and got a Lenovo 6gb ram laptop for 329. Works like a dream. Will never buy Toshiba again.Notice: this is a SUPER COMMON problem with the Toshiba Satellites. DO NOT buy this computer.

2731,Clay,2015,4,Great machine with a bad track pad that is easily fixed.,"I've only had this laptop for a couple of weeks now, but so far I am enjoying it. I haven't put it through any strenuous tasks yet, just lots of video streaming and some basic picture/gif editing, but it seems to be quick enough and operates smoothly. There was one annoyance right out of the box that almost made me send it back the next day: the touch pad was very glitchy, delayed and sometimes completely unresponsive. However, a quick google search led me to instructions on how to fix the problem myself. All I had to do was uninstall the touch pad driver, then download and reinstall the current driver from Toshiba's website. It didn't take very long at all and now the touch pad works fine. That and the bloatware, which is to be expected on pretty much all pre-built computers these days, are my only gripes so far.The display is great. I was somewhat against getting a touchscreen laptop at first but it has turned out to be pretty handy, I like it. The tablet mode is cool as well for relaxing on the couch and watching videos. I also find the backlit keyboard to be a nice feature in the dark.The sound quality is quite noticeable. These speakers are crystal clear even at high volumes, and they get LOUD.The overall build quality seems sturdy. It feels like a well-built machine despite the plastic casing. I think they could have used a matte finish instead of glossy to give it an aluminum-like feel and gotten away with it just fine, though.The SSD is small, and I bought this with the anticipation that I will likely upgrade to a larger SSD in the future. I read that it is much cheaper to buy a laptop with a small SSD and upgrade than it is to buy one with a large SSD already built in, which makes sense. I will say, though, that the SSD is considerably faster than most standard hard drives when it comes to start-up and opening programs. This computer restarts super quickly, which is nice.So if you're like me and just want a fast computer that's great for media and basic photo editing, this is definitely one to consider.",Toshiba Satellite Fusion 15 L55W-C5259 15.6-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Laptop,439.00,toshiba
2732,Rajkh,2015,5,Worth the price,"As you can see most of the reviews are from vine customers of free product and many freezeup complaints. So was skeptical at first to buy this laptop, but after a month of using it I would say it is a great buy at this price.The bootup is super fast due to SSD. Regarding the 128GB SSD,  people need to understand the difference between SSD and HDD. SSD is faster and hence costly! If you want higher memory space you could pay less for HDD and get a slower laptop. This laptop is not for storage! If you want to store your pictures you can use various cloud services out there like amazon's own photos app which comes free with prime membership or google photos both of which offers unlimited storage.Downloads are fast due to 802.11ac and there is no hangup while downloads like mentioned in other reviews. As with the touchpad freezing, I have had no such issues. Few times I thought I had the trackpad issues I had disabled the touchpad control by clicking on the F5 function key which doubles as enable/disable the touchpad. Probably you are trying to refresh the page with the function keys like you are used to in desktop keyboard and disabled the touchpad. In fact I dont use the touchpad much, if I have issues with touchpad I use the touchscreen. Keyboard is sleek macbook like and doesnt make much noise which I love. Backlight is cool but I am unable to find options to turn it off during day when it isn't needed -- found that FN+Z can be used for turning backlight on and off .Windows 10 isn't much different. Cortana voice assistant opens only in build apps and not the ones you download. Most of the search redirects to Bing.Display is beautiful and 4K videos does play, its little jittery when playing fast paced songs. I think can't expect much from the i5 processor or mobile hd graphics. I am not a gamer, so cannot comment on gaming experience.Audio wise it isn't good as beats as in my other hp laptop.Heavy for a tablet but can be propped up or folded on a table and can be used for long hours.Regarding the tablet mode change complaint that it doesnt work, It asks whether you want to exit/enter tablet mode and also whether you want to 'Always ask before changing' or 'Remember my decision'. I chose remember and it does remember.Doesn't heat up much. Only complaint I have which others have already mentioned is opening the laptop is a hassle.",Toshiba Satellite Fusion 15 L55W-C5259 15.6-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Laptop,439.00,toshiba
2733,JSE,2015,4,"Overall, very nice upgrade from laptops in 2012.","It's a really nice laptop. I was hesitant about Windows 10, being a Windows 7 user prior to the upgrade. But friends and my bf suggested that I need to just engage with it and get used to it. The screen is clear and large. The 360 function is pretty cool. I like how the fan is in the back instead of the bottom. The cord is nice and small, but can heat up a lot. I wish the sleeping function would last longer. Meaning I could leave it for 24 hours still on sleep then just hit my space ar and it would turn back on again. Instead I have to use the power button every single time. Which i don't like to do, because I fear of wearing it out. I have to turn it on and off multiple times a day since I use it for classes and work. I love the keyboard; it's smooth to type on, and so far pretty easy to clean.What I don't like about it, is that the edges of the laptop base itself (on the side of the mouse pad), has a rubbery lip, that is kind of uncomfortable to rest my forearms on, while i type. Which I type for long periods of time, doing research, papers, or taking lecture notes.The other thing I don't like about it, is the fact that it's not very easy to open it from the closed position. I have to angle it in a way where gravity will help it open, then carefully pry the two edges apart. My last laptop had a little lip that I could easily push on to open it. But that must be because of the 360 design...Overall, a wonderful upgrade from my Lenovo I've had for 4 years.",Toshiba Satellite Fusion 15 L55W-C5259 15.6-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Laptop,439.00,toshiba
2734,Paul M.,2017,3,Great computer but unreliable hardware and supply chain.,"There are some great things about this computer.  Lightweight, fast great screen.  I still wouldn't buy it again and will buy from a different manufacturer.At just less than a year old, it crashed and I had to reload it.  I didn't lose any data since I keep everything in the cloud but had to reload programs and set everything up again.At a year and a half old, the battery died.  It had been fine, then it quit working.  The laptop worked fine when plugged into a power receptacle. Ok, it happens, so I started searching the web for a replacement and couldn't find one.  I checked with my  local computer store and they could only find one at a sketchy website, so I called Toshiba.  They referred me to their parts supplier, who told me they don't sell those batteries. I called the company they suggested, a large tech parts supplier and they had one....but it would take almost a month to get it.  Ok fine, I'll wait.At a month since I ordered the battery, I got a notice today that it's been back ordered from the manufacturer and there's no estimate on when it will be available.If you buy this computer, be ready for it to become a desktop.

2735,Reviewer,2016,5,SSD is IT!!!!,"I've had this product now for more than 6 months.This was a replacement upgrade for another Windows 10 laptop (that used to run Windows 7)SSD was a MUST and the deal make or breaker -- along with quad core i5 and 6GB minimum RAM which is pretty standard on most laptops.  SSD was not...The other requirement was FLEXIBILITY in usage from classical latptop, to touchscreen laptop, to full tablet.The other underlying requirement was a top tier brand.  For me this means: HP, Toshiba, Dell, Lenovo in this product class and in that order of preference based on previous purchases both professionally and personally.Price was the other measure and deal maker.  This Toshiba with the latest SSD fit the bill.SUPER FAST product because of the SSD mainly.  Gorgeous screen and keyboard. Fun to type on actually.  Excellent battery life. Many think it's an Apple Mac....I do NOT recommend that one buys anything without SSD.  This IS your purchase measuring stick that would really be noticeable in terms of speed performance and how long your storage drive would last.  Look ma, no spinning mechanical device!Only con but is livable... wish Toshiba shipped a model with a LARGER SSD drive, but price point would have been a problem at the time of purchase. The good news is that SSD prices have fallen since then.5 stars for this product.  5 stars for Toshiba.

2736,Angeline I. Olliff,2017,5,My favorite piece of tech machinery!,"This is by far my most prized possession (excepting my recent auto buy). It's beautiful, and for a l5+in. screen, it's lightweight and easy to use both as a tablet and actually a top my lap.I've had it for a full year now and still 100% recomend it.One noteworthy annoyance: one day about 3 months ago, it failed to start. Not only that, but it also had zero responsiveness--no charging light, no whirring sounds, no keyboard light, not even a flicker of life on the screen. After researching and trying every troubleshooting strategy offered by Google & Toshiba, I got through to cust.srv. @Toshiba. They then asked me to re-do those measures in case I'm an idiot, all to no avail. Next was a $30 fee for a special box in which I would send the device to their Tennessee warehouse for inspection. This was stressful a) bc Toshiba wasn't clear about warranty coverage/exclusion, b) their site implied I'd be charged for the call!, and c) it took 2-3weeks to get it back, all the while playing phone tag w/reps. The final correspondence amounted to this:""When I pressed the power button, it turned on. We are now returning your device.""So, I'm out $30. It hasn't recurred. Fingers crossed. And the lesson: Keep the original packaging & don't heed the suggestion to purchase a fancy shipping box if this happens to you.One other problem: when switching to tablet mode, it is often slow to deactive the physical keyboard.I still love this thing.",Toshiba Satellite Fusion 15 L55W-C5259 15.6-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Laptop,439.00,toshiba
2737,Amazon Customer,2015,4,Fn keys hard to use,"I liked this PC when it arrived. It's a beautiful machine. I started using it, browsing web pages, and soon had a few open for various sites.I went to do my usual thing, and use Alt/F4 to close some down, when I couldn't see any Fn keys on the top row.The keys that would normally be F1, F2, F3, etc., weren't there, as far as I could tell.I did a quick search on the internet, and found that someone had the same issue. That person pointed out that the keys are lettered as F1, F2, etc.,, but in tiny lettering on the corner of the keycaps, in a faint, brownish color. So is the Fn shift key at the bottom of the keyboard.I took the Toshiba to the daylight at the window and, sure enough, the tiny lettering was there as described.But I use Fn keys a lot, and usually in a low light setting. And the keyboard backlighting, while fine for the main keyboard, is no help for the Fn keys.Maybe one could get used to the relative position of the keys, but why put up with that?I returned the item reluctantly.Otherwise, seems to be a fine laptop.",Toshiba Satellite Fusion 15 L55W-C5259 15.6-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Laptop,439.00,toshiba

If you have small plans for software, it's o.k., but, if have several productivity programs in mind, forget it.  Recently, the pad has developed a mind of its own.  It started it's own nasty little habit of opening files/directories with just a split second of a hover.  Try as I may, I haven't found a work around for that.  And, it could be quite a pain in the you know what.  Been building desktops since dos, but this is my first laptop.  Just ordered a Dell Inspirion with a 1t ssd.

The screen is nice and crisp, bright enough and looks great. Keyboard is backlit, I've never had that before so I really like that too. The only complaint I have is that there is an edge where you place your wrists and it digs into your arms. I've adjusted my typing style, but sometime when surfing the net I catch myself letting my arms press down on the keyboard ledge and it gets uncomfortable. Not enough to knock a star off.

2742,Tim Gier,2015,5,Lots of power & features for the price.,"This is a very good mid-level computer. The i5 chip coupled with 8GB or RAM will handle just about everything that a home user can throw at it - I suspect that if a person wants to do professional-level video editing or AutoCad type work that something beefier would be in order. But for everyday use, this thing is great. The SSD drive is quiet and the computer doesn't run hot or noisy at all. The touch screen is accurate (although it is a fingerprint magnet) and the versatility of the 360 degree hinge makes it fantastic for watching movies or video clips. I like the size because it has a full-sized keyboard with separate number pad - the whole keyboard is backlit.Sound is pretty good, although I admit that I'm not the best judge of high-fidelity.

It would have been nice to pull the battery and allow any static build up to discharge, but there is no way to do so with this model without voiding your warranty.  The back panel does not remove even after removing the screws.  Hence if you wanted to upgrade the hard drive or the battery you would be SOL.Toshiba used to stand for quality.
