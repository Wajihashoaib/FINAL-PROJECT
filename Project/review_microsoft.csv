0,0,Qbee00,"August 14, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Laptop!,"I got this laptop to replace my MacBook air and so far, it's great. It's a good size (12x9in- similar to the Mac which is 13x9in), lightweight, gorgeous color, and the screen is so crisp and clear. I've only had it for a day so hopefully it works out and doesn't need repairs since it's refurbished. It looked brand spanking new when I opened the box and has no scratches or anything anywhere, I looked very carefully. I noticed the laptop got pretty warm for a little bit but I knew that from other reviews so I'll probably just buy a laptop stand to put under. The speakers are nice and loud, the track pad is smooth and easy to use, and it sets you up with the ability to connect to your android phone. I set up my Samsung A32 and works like a charm.I'm very happy with it so far so hopefully I don't get any surprises on it not working. But I will update if that happens.","Microsoft Surface Laptop 3, 10th Gen Intel Core i5 (13.5-inch Touchscreen - 8GB Memory - 256GB SSD) - Sandstone (Renewed Premium)",$499.00,reviews.csv

I have had no major issues so far, except Netflix sometimes glitches. But that could also be my Wi-Fi’s problem. The touchscreen is amazing. Would recommend getting some kind of sticker or case to put on the bottom and top of computer to help with scratches. Over all it’s worth the money. It’s a great starter computer for college and I have encouraged friends to get this computer. I love it. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️","Microsoft Surface Laptop 3, 10th Gen Intel Core i5 (13.5-inch Touchscreen - 8GB Memory - 256GB SSD) - Sandstone (Renewed Premium)",$499.00,reviews.csv

11,11,Rob,"July 25, 2022",1.0 out of 5 stars,Obviously not tested during the refurbish,"This laptop was sold as ""certified refurbished"". It even says so on the fancy Microsoft box it comes in. While the laptop looked new, it is quite obvious that is is not refurbished. The laptop blue screened constantly. Every 30 to 60 seconds. It couldn't even make it thought the setup process. It's likely an issue with bad RAM. However, it wouldn't stay booted long enough to do any tests to verify. This should have been very apparent during the refurbish process and if any quality control was done at all before it left whatever facility repackaged it, it would have been easily caught. While presentation for a refurbished product was excellent, it's very sad it was shipped out again with likely the same flaw it was originally returned for.","Microsoft Surface Laptop 3, 10th Gen Intel Core i5 (13.5-inch Touchscreen - 8GB Memory - 256GB SSD) - Sandstone (Renewed Premium)",$499.00,reviews.csv

0,0,Silvie,"March 18, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,Worse than the SP4 for art,"I've had a Surface Pro 4 for years now and it has been used for all my personal and commissioned artwork since I got it. Before that, I had a SP3, which was also amazing -- so I'm a big Surface fan in general. Unfortunately, My Pro 4 is finally on its way out. The charging port is iffy, and it does not support Windows 11, meaning in a year or so it would be obsolete anyway. So, with the good sale on the 8s, which has 11 by default, I decided to upgrade.The 8 does have a bigger screen and an upgradable hard drive, which are the nicest features. But for art, it feels like a downgrade to a much cheaper tablet.Firstly, despite Microsoft saying it supports their specific models, none of the old Surface pens actually work fully. I tested OneNote, Paint, Medibang Paint Pro, and Photoshop, just to be sure it wasn't software-based.... but using any of those pens caused CRAZY line wobble on diagonals (see picture; straight line is when I tried using my finger). Drawing vertical or horizontal lines, no problem -- straight as your hand can go. Even using a ruler, attempting to draw any line that veers horizontally (or a circle/any shape that requires diagonal angles) produces a very strange squiggle that renders art impossible. I spent HOURS with Microsoft support, downloading drivers, reinstalling Windows, the whole works -- right up until they told me that it must be a device problem and to return it. So return it I did.... and the second one has the exact same problem. I drove all the way into town to a store that had a display model and tested my multiple pens on that one, and found even the display has that issue. Weird seeing as they even sold the old pens still!So, I tried upgrading to the Slim Pen 2, a nice extra hundred and twenty bucks that I didn't expect to have to spend since my SP4 pens were listed as compatible. But, it works! The pen is nice, too, though I am frustrated that I had to buy it at all. If the computer can't recognize the pens fully, IMO they shouldn't be listed as supported. If I had known that I needed the newest surface pen from the get go, I wouldn't be nearly as annoyed.But then, I found out that not ONLY do you need to use a very specific pen.... but you CAN'T use a screen protector. My SP4 worked with a good tempered glass screen protector on it, absolutely no problem. I went through 3 protectors over the last few years due to them cracking or getting scratched, so I definitely need a protector -- but upon installing any glass protector on the 8, I get the diagonal wobbly line issue AGAIN. For pete's sake. I tested 4 different screen protectors and had the same issue every time. I read reviews for every single brand's screen protector available on Amazon, and each one had a review saying they had touch issues after applying it.Eventually, I found a film-based matte protector that DOES work. It will maybe 1/20 times produce a wobbly line, but is far more consistent and usable. Only problem is that there was literally one option available for a film-based protector on amazon, it was awful to install and has bubbles, and the matte visibility makes it have an awful texture/distorts the picture a bit. Perhaps as the device gets older, more screen protectors will be developed for it that aren't annoying, but for now I feel forced into using it this way and I still find myself using my 4 despite its charging issues.Thus far I'm very disappointed in the 8. As a note-taking device or portable Windows tablet, it's fine,  but for art I'd pick an SP4 over it any day.","Microsoft Surface Pro 8-13"" Touchscreen - Intel® Evo Platform Core™ i7-16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Device Only - Platinum (Latest Model)","$1,911.69",reviews1.csv
1,1,Karl Connolly,"August 22, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Loving this version of MS Surface Pro,"I’ve had the surface pro three for many years and use it for DJing with a leading provider of D.J. Software. The requirements of the sulfur however really taxed that version of the surface pro three and so this upgrade to surface pro eight has been like coming out of the dark ages into the light. The system is incredibly responsive, and I’m absolutely loving the speed at which it processes the application and any of the tasks that I’ve thrown at it. My only issue is that for some reason Microsoft has chosen to replace the SD slot with the capability to replace  the internal drive and I really miss that little drive. Still love the 8 though and would recommend it. Microsoft in windows 11 have done amazing things with respect to ease of set up an configuration and connectivity to the device by a facial recognition etc.","Microsoft Surface Pro 8-13"" Touchscreen - Intel® Evo Platform Core™ i7-16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Device Only - Platinum (Latest Model)","$1,911.69",reviews1.csv

4,4,Jerry,"April 9, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Built wonderfully for Windows 11 but rather expensive. Windows Home, no micro-SD slot.","It was time to replace my old surface pro 3 which I bought new several years ago since it became very slow (only 8 GB of ram) and hot while the battery slowed to only 1 hour duration. I was torn between purchasing the Dell XPS 13 (which was about $300 cheaper) or the Surface Pro 8. I chose the Surface since I preferred the tablet functionality while retaining the option of a keyboard which is removeable (sold separately). I find it convenient to sit in my recliner with the tablet to read a book online.I bought the 32GB version of the Surface pro 8 since you cannot upgrade the memory later. Frankly, it is very fast, boots up within seconds, and I really enjoy Windows 11 on it. The touch screen is very responsive, especially with a new pen. Be sure to review and select the gesture controls to avoid erratic movements and find that place in settings to use your pen as a mouse. I use it with as a PC with a keyboard purchased separately and as a tablet when I read my books. It has two USB-C ports on the side (thunderbolt 4) which you could connect through a hub to a monitor (I have not). It connects nicely to my roku wirelessly as I cast the computer screen to the TV when needed to show pictures/videos. The surface pro 3 could not.After spending all of this money I was annoyed to discover it came with Windows Home and not Windows Pro, so I spent more money to upgrade it from the windows store. It does NOT come with a micro-SD card slot which the Surface pro 3 had!  But the hard drive is replaceable which is some benefit. Any further annoyances are due to getting use to Windows 11, which overall I like and will eventually upgrade my other PCs. Overall, I am very happy with this expensive purchase.","Microsoft Surface Pro 8-13"" Touchscreen - Intel® Evo Platform Core™ i7-16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Device Only - Platinum (Latest Model)","$1,911.69",reviews1.csv

Now, I must let you know that these 2 units were brand new, sealed in the original box, with no fingerprint, and everything was clean and sealed.Also according to a Microsoft technician, he never heard of such a poor battery performance on a unit out of the box, much less 2 units.I performed both battery reports and was right on the spot. The frustrating trips to UPS Store, and time on the phone explaining over and over it really drain the best out of you, but knowing that Amazon back you up with amazing associates that are caring enough for your disappointment and frustration is priceless.I am planning to buy again a Surface Pro 8 but this time I will buy it directly from Microsoft just in case that batch got some bad vodoo energy or something a little more technical than that.","Microsoft Surface Pro 8-13"" Touchscreen - Intel® Evo Platform Core™ i7-16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Device Only - Platinum (Latest Model)","$1,911.69",reviews1.csv

They sent it off to Microsoft telling me there would be no charge, but it would take 3 weeks. I track it online it is sent to Microsoft and sent back without repair.

0,0,Duhkgeorge,"August 2, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Surface Laptop Studio (SLS) - Review of i7, 16 Ram 500G first gen unit","Quick take/summaryI love the function and feel of this machine.  It is a unique piece of equipment, where I mostly need a laptop, but occasionally I need a tablet for writing.  The slim pen 2 has no lag, which would be a deal breaker for me.Why are there two stars knocked off?  The batter life is not what was advertised and was enough to annoy me.  Standard browsing or video usage, after a few days of use and updates, you can probably expect about 6-8 hours of life.  This is far short of advertised, but that works for me, even if I'm mildly annoyed.  The big kicker is that when you game and the (very quiet and effective) fans come on, the battery life is 30-40 minutes at a full charge.  Something to be mindful of.  If that works for you, add a star for each battery issue that you don't mind, and that may be how you'll find the machine.  It's a beautiful piece of work that I don't regret purchasing, but the battery life is not as long lasting as Microsoft implied and the way they got their test results is not one I'd deem usable unless the room was pitch black.Review set-up:Summary above, Details below.***update 8/29/2022***I've knocked off two stars.  The battery life when using games that require power are is just unusable for more than a short 30-40 minute burst if you were fully charged.  I feel that really limits the usability for anyone who selected the model with the video chip.  I'm mostly annoyed at the false advertising.  The run time is decent if you're just doing every day work, but decent is 6-8 hours, which is also not what was advertised.  I reduced my refresh rate to 60, and that didn't seem to affect the gaming duration.  It was bad either way.Oh, and I also have managed to bump loose the power cord a few times without noticing.  Not as secure as I'd like when actually used on a lap.  On a desk, a non-issue.***update 2022_08_19***Just tried out the kingmaker game with battery only and boy does power drain fast.  If you're using the power with the fan running, I suspect you'll be lucky to get two hours out of the machine.  I got less than an hour, but the battery was not completely full, so heads up.  I have my screen refresh at 120, so maybe I'd get better battery life if I reduced.  I was just surprised it was so short.  My other laptop would chew through batteries when gamming too, but I got more life out of it.The pen, which I thought had a pretty secure magnet, does manage to get knocked loose.  It would be nice if Microsoft had some kind of notification when it disconnected.  I've noticed when I get up from my chair, it's been on my lap, and something falls to the floor.  It's always the pen.  Issues will likely depend on how you use it and if you wear things that can get caught by the pen, but heads up.I'm still happy with the purchase.  The power features I would be unlikely to really use unless plugged in.  In this sense, people that need the power are unlikely to be happy with this machine if they expected that power and prolonged battery life while unplugged.***update 2022_08_15***Finally had some time to load pathfinder kingmaker to the laptop.  The game instantly caused the fan to ramp up to dispel the heat.  The right side became very warm, both where my right hand palm rests while I type, and underneath on the right side.  Warm, but not burning to type on or on the lap.  The ramped up fans move a lot of very warm air, but it's the sound of air moving, and while it's noise, it's not unpleasant or uncomfortable to talk with like many other computer fans I've had.  I give the cooling a good thumbs up, although I was surprised it came on so quickly.***update 2022_08_06***The battery life continues to improve slightly.  2.5 hours of dnd using hero labs, wifi, moderate browsing for rules clarification and minimal sketching burned up about 11% battery life.The machine has been incredibly quiet although I haven't run taxing software yet.  This is all a HUGE improvement over my previous machine where the fan would be constantly on with minimal work and would roar when gaming, when I used to game.I find transitioning between keyboard and note taking/sketching to be an extremely satisfying experience.  I had no idea how much my previous laptop bothered me will all the flaws of the keyboard and touchpad issues I experienced.  I will say the transition can be a little clunky when I'm typing and then need to make a note and then typing again.  I find that I don't like making more than a one-word notation in laptop mode and so I'm switching between both when doing a mixed document.One note handles written text differently than I thought it would.  If you're mixing typed text with written, they act as two separate things.  Hitting enter will move your typed text (if done above) but it won't move what you've written, which will need to be moved separately .  As such, you may want to write to one side, type on the other and then select and combine when done with both to print as a pdf document.***update 2023_08_04***Battery life:  I switched back to 120hz and while the battery is still draining faster, after 4 hours I still have a 55% charge.  Of note, I've been away from my keyboard quite a few times today, but the screen is set to remain on and I also was streaming music for part and there was a lot of internet searching today.  What I am saying is that after all the updates, the battery life for 120hz, while not on par with 60hz, seems greatly improved for basic tasks.  Obviously taxing software will burn through batter life much faster.******What are the key things you should know before buying?Battery Life:The battery life you likely to receive from the unit depends on usage and programs and blah blah blah.  I did a lot of research in this area for real world usage and found that when I change the screen resolution to 60hz, there is a noticeable improvement of the battery life to about 8-10 hours of solid use.  Ten looks like the absolute max.  With the screen at 120hz, I was watching the battery life fall and would guess about 3 to four hours of use.  My usage was browsing, one note, excel, email, and hero labs (a DND character application).  While I have a machine with a video card, I don't tend to game on my laptop, and I haven't played with drafting tools yet.  I have not done long term testing to see if 120hz eventually has an improved battery life after configurations/learnings/updates are all complete.  I switched my machine back to 120hz and it now appears to be draining slower, so maybe?  I would say to plan on my first case scenario, and I'll update if I notice better performance long term.While I can't say Microsoft lies about the battery life, as they provide the ridiculous specs in which they achieve it, I will say that their numbers are misleading based on real world use.Slim Pen 2 and SLS combo:If you're not purchasing this with a pen, you are purchasing the wrong machine.  I believe this machine is specifically for those that need a hybrid work environment.  Drawing concepts in presentations, showing work for math, chemistry, and physics homework, or just sketching design concept ideas.  This machine works well for these things, but all require a pen.  There are cheaper and higher performing machines out there if this is not your need.  Microsoft sells these separately, but they should be purchased together, else, why buy an SLS?There is practically no lag with the slim pen 2!  Lag was my biggest issue with surface and pen technology.  I would not say it is perfect, but when you're looking for rough handwritten notes, this device fits the bill and the slim pen 2 is fantastic.  I won't say it's perfect as zooming in on lines you draw the pen will want to meander, but for real world rough uses, I give it a thumbs up.The magnet to hold the pen is strong and the location is under the touch pad area (to the front, there's a lip on the edge of the device).  Not a perfect connection, but unlikely to be lost when NOT in a bag.  Bags with junk will bump and who knows, so FYI.  It's nice to be out of the way while typing, and available for use.Performance:I can't speak to this.  I don't benchmark, and people can go out there and review that themselves.  I haven't opened up inventor or fusion yet.  I still need to load.  I feel these reviews are all over the internet though, unlike battery and pen usage, so I expect my results will be the same.  I also don't do complex modeling, so my usage in this area would be light and not useful to someone who does it for a living.Note:  This is now a year old and not a powerful computing device.  If performance is a MAJOR concern, you might want to invest in more current machines.  This was not super powerful when it first came out.Keyboard and Pad:The keys click nicely.  May last laptop had very compressed keys (with a T key that started to fail) and this keyboard feels much better.  Key locations feel intuitive.The Keyboard lighting works well and has different brightness options.  I have mine on the lowest.The pad clicks nicely, and I don't accidently bump and click like I did with my other laptop.Windows 11:If you are not used to the operating system, it's a change from windows 10.  I greatly dislike change for the sake of change.  You can read online reviews about the layout.  It's different but I am slowly getting used to it.  I did have to figure out how to navigate and what some of the symbols meant.  You can still pin items to the taskbar, and there are some items you have to change in system and personalization or right click the taskbar and select taskbar settings.After I figured it out, it's fine, but change (grumble grumble)There are also a lot to the system, so poking at the various options to understand how you can tweak your laptop might be good.  But, if you just want it to work, after a slight learning curve it is fine.Stability and set-up:Set-up was pretty easy.  Of note, the power cord has a light on its head opposite to where it connects to the laptop.  This allows you to see if the power is on, if you have a charging issue.  My power strip had been bumped off and I had to google, once I knew there was supposed to be a light and where, it was easy to figure out I had no power and turned the power strip back on.Stability seems mostly good.  No crashes.  The screen orientation changes work but are a bit weird when transitioning.  ""Jumpy"" might be a good way to describe.  Once settled it's all good.The hinge and magnets:This thing is stiff.  A technic to adjust the screen into different positions.  When lying flat I lift the edge closest to me and lift the entire screen fully open, and then I tilt the screen down.  I reverse this when transitioning instead of moving and then trying to transition the screen over the viewing angle I want.  I found this to be much easier and less scrapping.  Otherwise, you're fighting the device, so heads up.The hinge itself seems good.  We will see how it holds up.Quality of build:While parts of the device are metal (screen portion), the base appears to be plastic.  Metal lasts better than plastic, and time will tell how this holds up.  I expect discoloring and scratches on the plastic, and I hope I never drop this.Weight:This is heavier than I thought.  While my last power laptop (incredible fully maxed device that lasted me seven years before the keyboard started dying) was slightly heavier and larger with a 13"" screen, this feels heavier despite being smaller and slightly lighter.  It weighs in at just over 4lbs.  It is smaller and so more dense.  The screen is a great proportion and I feel like there's more viewable space.  My previous laptop had a wide screen, and it wasn't a great use of real-estate for a laptop.Heating:As mentioned, I'm doing everyday tasks and the laptop barely registers as warm on the bottom.  One trend I've noticed with other ""performance"" laptops, is that the containers are too small to appropriately cool the devices and they get incredibly hot (looking specifically at you, Dell, who I will never buy from again).  Already this device is better than a number of other slim ""performance"" laptops I've looked at.What were my primary motivations in purchasing and who might this work well for:People who need to draw to communicate ideas.People who need a long battery life.People who need a portable device that doesn't lag when writing and they need to write.People who hate putting keyboards on the surface of a table or lap because... it just seems wrong.People who need some power, but are okay with a non-top of the line machine.People who are okay spending premium money for a lower spec'd item that fits the above unique needs.Overall?I knocked off a star due to specifications, but the machine works exactly as I hoped, and I am enjoying my interaction with it.  I understand why so many compare it to a mac.  Apple products have a great ""feel"" to them, and this laptop definitely replicates some of that if not all of it.Final note:If you purchase, defintely look up various issues that might be important to you.  I found reviews tended to be very superficial and even biased.  I found that looking up issues (battery life, heating, crashing, etc.) helped me weed out some of the machines I was looking at.  It wasn't that none of the machines had negative reviews, but more the quantity of negative reviews compared to others.  The SLS definitely has had negative reviews, but the amount compared to others I was looking at were significantly less, so I took a leap at the high price tag, and so far I'm happy.I will update as I run into changes and get a feel for the performance of the piece too.  I hope this helped.","Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio - 14.4"" Touchscreen - Intel® Core™ i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Platinum","$1,590.00",reviews2.csv
1,1,Nuhash Mashud,"February 22, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,Very good but has flaws and definitely not for everyone,"Now let me preface this by being clear. I am an undergraduate computer science student. My father pretty much gave this computer to me as a gift during Christmas just for something to take notes on. I use the Whiteboard app a lot in fact to be able to take notes on it. I understand that you could type out the notes on a computer or whatever but I prefer using a notebook but at the same time I need to know what I'm writing about and a notebook can only grant me so much space. So this may not be a device for everyone but it is for me at least for the version I got.After two months with this product I could safely say this is a very good product that Microsoft has made. I have used it a little for drawing here and there and it does a fine job and for note-taking it's a great device with a bit of flaws.Goods*The screen is extremely high-quality. The gloss may turn some people off but I think it's great it does get a little dusty but that's easy to clean up.*The mouse pad is great. It reminds me of the MacBook mouse pad but it's much more responsive and smooth.*The keyboard took me time to get used to, especially considering this is the first time I ever used the laptop without any num keys.*The speakers get as loud as I want them to be but audio definitely sounds crisp and extremely high quality.*The way that the device switches from laptop mode to tablet mode is pretty simple for the most part, there is one thing that however concerns me but I'll get to that later I like the little bit of tilt that it has on the upper level because it gives me a better elevation to where I want to write.*The magnets are really helpful and strong when it comes to me putting the pen close to the computer.Bads*The battery life because it runs out very fast whenever I'm using the device like I was in class for 50 minutes one time and it drained very fast. I was at full100% battery and at the end of class it drained to 36%.*No USB ports I know more devices are using the USB C Port right now but the limited amount of the USB option really does bug me personally considering that I still have more devices that uses a standard USB cable over a USB C I understand that I could probably buy an adapter for that or whatever but it would have been nice to have more options for the device rather than just 2 USB C port. I'm not saying they should go all in and include two USB ports on the left and one on the right but at least one would have been nice.*There's no way to lay the screen flat on the table in tablet mode. This is one of the biggest problems because one thing I liked about other surface devices is that they would allow me to position the device anyway I wanted. However with this one you don't get as many options all you get was the flat bit tilted tablet mode and a viewing mode as you could say. This brings me to the biggest problem with the device and this may sound minor to many people but for me it kind of scares me.*The tablet to laptop mode hinges scares me to the point where I think if I bend it enough it's going to break. I'm not sure when it will happen but I will make sure to update people when it does. Because the device looks very sensitive and again it scares me and I usually don't get scared of this type of thing but I am for this one. When I am writing or drawing I exert a lot of pressure on a table surface or notebook that is how I feel comfortable when I write or draw and on this device I get scared every time I do something like that.*It is a little overpriced for it's specs and functionality.  256gb ssd is good but for $1,500 that's too much. Considering that there are laptops with the same functionality and better specs this was a bit expensive for what it is.Overall this is a great device may not be for everyone but it is great non the less for me. It will not automatically replace a tablet for those that have one and may not be the best tool for artist. But considering that there are people that may want a device that has the same functions of a tablet but also be able to use it as a computer this is a very good device for them if they are ok with the pricing. Keep in mind the version that I bought was not ment for gaming I didn't buy it to play video games, so for those that are getting this there is gonna be alot of restrictions when it comes to gaming.","Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio - 14.4"" Touchscreen - Intel® Core™ i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Platinum","$1,590.00",reviews2.csv

I’m also a 3D artist at home (Blender, TopoGun, Maya, 3DS, Chitubox, etc.).When I have to, I use Office.My usage patterns are all over the place.First: I was skeptical of the “cloth hinge”. I flipped the hinge over and over for two days. I can safely say, I t’s not gonna wear out quickly.Having used Wacom products for years, I didn’t know what to expect from “the pen”.The Physical Pen Integration is well thought out. It pairs, charges, and stores in a well hidden (and easily accessible) location. The Pen is also well integrated with the latest version of leading artists’ software.From an artist’s standpoint, when you draw on the screen, you’ll probably need an external keyboard. I haven’t tried “the dial”. The “feel” is different from a Cintiq. It’s a bit squishy, but acceptable if you can adapt.Windows Home can be easily upgraded to Enterprise with the appropriate ISO and Product Key.I would prefer a larger amount of available RAM. 32 GB is too little for me. (Apple has 64GB laptops, just sayin’).This is probably “more laptop” than the average user would need. It’s also on the heavy side.The Screen-Flipping-Feature isn’t for everyone. Although, it does more than you’d expect. It allows you to tilt the screen forward (over the keyboard) when using an external keyboard. You can also flip the screen away from you and use the computer as a Hotel Movie Screen.Unfortunately, The Pen isn’t included.Heavier than anything “traditional”Anything but “traditional.”","Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio - 14.4"" Touchscreen - Intel® Core™ i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Platinum","$1,590.00",reviews2.csv
3,3,NYGarlic,"August 21, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I had hoped for,"As I reviewed this, it has been three days since I've received the Laptop Studio.There's been some getting used to and some adjustments that I had to make. So partially this has been with the Laptop Studio or with Windows 11 (since it came installed with Windows 11).For the device, had some problems such as it not charging when I plugged it in. I thought maybe it was my charger's issue (even thought it was working fine the previous evening) so I went and tried another charger - still didn't work. Had to search online, and seems like others experienced the same issue. Had to do a hard restart in order for it to work.Another issue was that the time was two minutes fast. Checked the settings and it said it was not synced since 2015. Was the Studio Laptop even around since 2015? Had to manually change the time but eventually was able to sync the time to auto update.Another issue is when I move a handful of folders from one directory to another. It will move but will leave copies of the folders (empty) in the original location. Freaked me out as I thought something happened to my files.Initially, the screen would flicker. Encountered it a handful of times so I did a google search on a solution. Some people said to open up Nvidia Control Panel but when I did that, NCP would just disappear. Had to google search for a solution there too.My biggest issue with the Laptop Studio is how slow it is. I'm the type of person who has a TON of tabs but still my old Surface Book 2 was able to handle it at 16GB RAM. This device has 32GB RAM and is suffering. I thought maybe it was the Chrome and Opera not optimized for Windows 11 but when I tried to open a folder on my desktop, it struggled too. There's a lag in everything I do.*****Also, Amazon royally screwed up my order. They initially sent me the wrong item; Surface Pro 7. So I wanted to exchange it but they said it's a third party so they cannot exchange. They wanted me to return it and buy it again. NOT as simple as exchanging it but fine. Even when the Surface Pro 7 was delivered back to Amazon, they don't initiate the return. So I contact Amazon to initiate the return, they then initiate the return for the SECOND PURCHASE!

I've had it several months now and I use it with a surface pen to take notes with it as if it was a regular pen-and-paper notebook. The processor and graphics card also allow me to run all of my favorite video games smoothly without any technical difficulties. It is a large computer and is a bit more heavier than I would've preferred, but overall that's something I'm willing to sacrifice to be able to have everything in one place. The only real grudge I have with it is the battery life. If you're not running anything particularly battery consuming (ie. video games) it usually can last a few hours. However, be prepared to watch your battery levels drop when you play even 5 minutes of your favorite PC game.Overall, if you're looking for a tablet-computer that can handle heavy loads and is a bit less pricey compared to it's Apple and Dell counterparts, this computer might just become your next best friend.","Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio - 14.4"" Touchscreen - Intel® Core™ i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Platinum","$1,590.00",reviews2.csv

6,6,J. Graham,"April 7, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best laptop I’ve ever purchased!,"First of all: I am a tech junky and have bought a dozen, or more, portable computers over the years. I generally end up frustrated with poor screen quality, misrepresented battery stamina, poorly backlit (or not at all) keyboard, poor trackpad, or something else I didn’t know prior to purchase.I bought two. One for my wife, one for me. I chose the 32GB with 11th Gen Intel i7 CPU with independent NVIDIA GE Force 3050 RYX graphics card. This is one absolutely impressive computer after 5-days. Windows 11 takes a little getting used to. It’s not bad, just a little different. Eventually you have to upgrade so we’ll all have to switch at some point.Battery appears to last over 13-hours with screen as bright as it gets. It has zero lag switching apps. It seems much “lighter” than prior OS.It is a little heavy to be truly portable, but you could choose the 13” display instead of the 14.4”. I’m sure the long lasting battery is responsible for the overweight laptop.I will use it “in-dock” 85% of the time running two 35” monitors, multiple data hog financial streaming apps, desktop version of MS Outlook and a ton of browser windows tabs. With the quality and quantity of RAM I suspect it’ll be just fine, but I will update after a while operating that glut of functions.Concluding my rambling review, I love the MS Surface Studio 14.4” w 32GB and 1TB SSD. If I had to say something negative it’d be that the generic dock the claims to work with it does not work in my ZIP code. Pay up for the MS branded dock. Use quality cables and plug strips to get the most out of your Surface.Go ahead and buy yours!

7,7,Steven Harder,"April 13, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Almost perfect,"I bought the Surface Laptop Studio along with the Acer ConceptD 7 Ezel in order to compare them. The color and contrast on the Acer were obviously much better, and the Slim Pen 2 gets jittery when drawing slowly/carefully. However, the Surface display gets much brighter, and writing/drawing on it feels much more natural, mostly because of the awkward aspect ratio on the Acer and a very noticeable gap between its display and digitizer. I had also anticipated that the three set positions for the screen on the Surface might compare poorly against the Acer's infinitely variable ""Ezel"", but it didn't end up bothering me at all. I tend to use the middle position, where the display sits between the keyboard and touchpad, even when I'm holding it in one arm and using it in portrait mode. For some reason it just works for me.The speakers on the Surface are very impressive. It's quite a bit louder than my MacBook Pro, though not quite as pleasant to watch movies on, since the display has less contrast and the audio isn't as full on the low-end. The Acer's speakers are a complete joke, but all of this is really a side note, since I wouldn't use either device for watching movies and I use studio monitors for audio. Really, my only complaint about the Surface is the stupid, stupid, stupid proprietary ""Surface Connect"" charging/docking port (don't waste your money on the dock, since there is no way to use it without continually charging the laptop and inevitably ruining your battery, ""kiosk mode"" notwithstanding). The fact that the Surface with $400 of accessories still costs $1200 less than the ConceptD certainly doesn't hurt.Ultimately, I returned the Acer and I have no regrets.","Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio - 14.4"" Touchscreen - Intel® Core™ i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Platinum","$1,590.00",reviews2.csv

Previously I have a surface laptop 2 for my wife, and it seems not powerful enough to handle the school work she has to design for students. Everything looks vivid on the screen, and the aluminum chassis screams for supreme quality. However, that is not what you have expected. Within the first week, the first unit came up with a vertical green line on the screen. The troubleshooting steps provided by Microsoft are miserable. Ironically, feedbacks from the user communities are surprisingly good. (How the heck a tech giant failed to accomplish an entry level introduction to test their devices?)Amazon pushed us to visit Microsoft for RMA, which costs us $19.99 for shipping even it is their quality issue. I don’t understand why the shipping costs exist in the first place.The second unit seems to be alright after one month use. However, the USB C to display output seems not stable. It could be the issue with the chipset design.Overall, it is a 11th gen intel CPU, but only with 4 cores. If you really consider it as a “studio” machine, you are…….

It functions perfectly as my daily work laptop (email, office suite, contracts, budgets, etc.), but has sufficient processing capacity and memory to support my photo/video editing. As a HUGE plus, the fact that this folds flat as a tablet has ensured that I pretty much never use my older iPad anymore as this replaces that device as well for home/couch use. In short, i've been super happy with this device and would recommend it to anyone. I'd also recommend pairing with the new Microsoft Dock 2 as it allows for connecting to all peripherals + multiple monitors. My only beef with the Surface Studio is that it has only  (2) USB 3 ports and (1) audio port (nothing else) which means you need a USB 3 hub for peripherals on the go (including card readers, etc.).

Too bad that Amazon doesn't provide a replacement :(UPDATE:I checked unit in Best Buy and it has absolutely same sensitivity issue. It doesn't have double clicking sound when I press though. I'd say that initially you going to be satisfied with this product but at some point you'll start noticing some issues such as:- Sometimes pointer would jump back to a previous position when you press touchpad. It looks like a software glitch, but over course of 6 months it wasn't addressed  (you can search on Reddit about other people reporting this issue).- You'll notice sometimes after pulling laptop out from a backpack touchpad becomes very sensitive. You won't be able to figure for a long time what's going on, but eventually you'll find out that putting laptop to sleep and flipping it upside down for 10 seconds reproduces issue. Weird, huh?- Eventually, in tablet mode you'll find out when you press on the screen near one of the edges it moves and slightly hits laptop's base which produces annoying sound. That happens because display is slightly bent in the middle on that side. You'll take a ruler to figure if that's true and you'll find that not only that side is bent/bowed but all sides of display aren't straight. It might be normal though but I'm not sure if it should be this way. I see that other laptops I own have some sort of curvature, but I never noticed it because that laptop do not have touch displays.If you decide to buy this laptop then you should lower your expectations below MacBook Pro (I own 2019).

I initially bought the Surface Pro 8 but the detachable keyboard and kickstand felt flimsy/awkward - the solidity of the SLS fills the niche between the Pro and the Surfacebook.It's a robust device - solid design, with MS addressing the shortcomings of the Surfacebook (hinge, detachable tablet, top heaviness) with the interesting folding design to turn the SLS ""laptop"" into a ""tablet"".The SCREEN is great, but while on paper the Pro seems to only have a slightly higher resolution, the Pro is noticeably higher in actuality.  The 14.4"" screen offers a lot of real estate, excellent for digital art - note it is also very reflective/glossy.The SLIM PEN is excellent - the haptic feedback gives an improved handling sensation compared with the plastic nib on glass typical of other systems - artists definitely it a try, it might be a gamechanger for you.The SPEAKERS do a great job - mostly listen to EDM, and while the speaker size limits the fullness of the bass, I've listened to music on the SLS for 12+hrs without aural fatigue.KEYBOARD and TRACKPAD both function well - touch typing is well accommodated.Reviews I read prior to purchase were largely written at the time of release, Oct 2021, many complained that the PRICE was too high.  MS has since reduced the price ($1800's for i7, 16GB RAM, 512 GB SSD, NVIDIA GeForce Rx), which somewhat mitigates the complaints.  This SLS configuration is also 4lbs, which isn't light!The one design issue I have is the COOLING VENTS exhaust to the front of the laptop (unlike every other laptop I've used) - it feels weird having hot air blowing over your hands/wrists and the front of the laptop can get quite warm.  Also, the SLS would surely look excellent in black, but currently only platinum is available (maybe as a result of the sliding screen would scratch up the black surface).I've largely used the SLS plugged-in, but from the little use of the battery, it does seem that the battery life is mediocre - brightness and setting to screen refresh 60Hz helps matters.From a week or so of use, it is an enjoyable experience - it has a couple of shortcomings but IMHO it is the best device out there in the Surface line of devices.","Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio - 14.4"" Touchscreen - Intel® Core™ i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Platinum","$1,590.00",reviews2.csv

El panel táctil (trackpad) deja un poco que desear en cuanto a tacto y respuesta, lo alterno con un mouse inalámbrico Microsoft.Los aspectos negativos son varios:- El peso: es un ladrillo, excesivamente pesado, no se entiende. No es agradable para viajar, ni para moverlo de sitio.- Se recalienta demasiado, a pesar del diseño de evacuación del calor que tiene, se pone muy caliente al tacto.- El sonido no es nada excepcional, los parlantes están disimulados debajo del teclado y creo que ello disminuye su eficiencia. Existen soluciones mejores en el mercado.- Lo peor: ¡la batería no dura! Microsoft anuncia un día de trabajo, en lo personal se me pone en modo de ""ahorro de batería"" después de unas 5 a 6 horas de uso normal (navegación Internet, mails, Word, Excel, WhatsApp, nada fuera de lo normal).Por el precio que pagué me siento engañado y muy frustrado.

37,37,Chris,"November 20, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Unreliable hardware, no international support, slow processor","This is my third Surface device from Microsoft, and I had very, very good luck with SP4 and SP6). And so, I purchased the i7 32GB RAM 2TB option. Having the ability to fold and rotate the screen to portrait mode really helped with certain types of data displays— that was great! That it was equipped with a somewhat dated i7 processor wasn’t a serious performance issue, as having a fast SSD and lots of RAM makes up for the somewhat slower/older i7 CPU that this is equipped with. However, the Surface Studio Laptop just lasted 4 months before the display failed suddenly and completely while on a work trip from the US to the UK. It seems that, while rare, hardware failures can happen with any computer. On a related note, I had a hardware failure with the SP4 when it was fairly new, and that was sorted quickly by Microsoft. And so, I had high hopes for a solution while I was traveling internationally for work.Unfortunately, I found out that these devices are apparently limited to support from the country you bought it from— and so, if you are not working internationally then likely not an issue for you. But if you to travel internationally for work, it may present a problem (even if you purchase the premium Microsoft support/warranty). Apparently, the UK does not support US purchased Microsoft devices (though they were really very polite about it, I was out of luck). And so, I will be borrowing customer’s computers to do demos until I can return to the US to have my nearly-new Surface Laptop Studio replaced with a refurbished one (Microsoft replacements under warranty are often refurbished units).","Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio - 14.4"" Touchscreen - Intel® Core™ i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Platinum","$1,590.00",reviews2.csv

1,1,Amazon Customer,"October 2, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Replaced my laptop and ipad,"I use this as my go to school/work laptop, as well as a drawing display. For both the surface works well, switching between modes is flawless and the pen is very responsive. I got the matte black one, and while i like the color it does chip easily, with light usage there is some chips in the paint but that is to be a expected with matte colors, they just don't hold up as well. I would not recommend getting matte black for a child or if you are a heavy user. Another thing is that the batter doesn’t last long when using the surface continuously even when on battery saver, I'm a student so there are times where i could be using it for hours at a time, pretty much after 4 hours I’ll have to plug it in. Which leads me to the charger itself, the connector is magnet based and not a real port so to speak, so its very weak. If you’re like me and you like to use laptops on the couch or in bed its going to constantly come unplugged from shifting and movement. Its very annoying i wish it was just a normal charging port. The battery and charging port are the main reasons i rate this 4/5 stars, the decision to get matte black was on me so ill take that L, but over all i do like this laptop/tablet. I don’t use this for gaming so I don’t know how it holds up there, but i cant imagine having steam, discord, and whatever other apps open and having it run just as well as a dedicated desktop, this is more of a light work laptop. As i said before i do use this for drawing and for that it does hold up well. I typically have a few chrome tabs open and a large canvas while drawing (5600x6000px 600dpi) and even when i get up to 40 layers i don't experience lag. And unless you’ve got eagle eyes, you wont notice any delay from the pen, unless you’ve got some high stabilization settings. If you’re looking to upgrade your laptop or looking to consolidate your tech, this is a great product. This totally killed my need for my ipad and runs way better than my old 2017 laptop, so much so that i ended up selling both of them.Some notes:- the pen is sold separately but i do recommend getting it if you plan on drawing or using the surface to write notes.- if you plan on getting a keyboard with it I recommend the brydge surface wireless keyboard, the hinges are strong and really make the surface feel like a laptop","Microsoft Surface Pro 7 – 12.3"" Touch-Screen - 10th Gen Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory – 1TB SSD – Platinum","$2,300.00",reviews3.csv

3,3,Jennifer,"April 15, 2020",5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE this device,"The portability and comfort of the tablet with the functionality of a full-fledged laptop. I bought a Surface 3 several years ago and now... I can't go back. I love these things too much. It comes with me everywhere. If you're wondering why buy a Surface which is twice the price of a laptop, here's why:1. If you read a lot of pdfs or e-books there is no comparison.  Using the pen on pdfs, the ability to jot down notes in word or pictorial form, the ability to create links to other information that can later be clicked on: Unmatched anywhere else  Turn it sideways and it's a full sheet of paper for writing and notetaking  Turn it sideways to read Comic Books! OMG!  I'll be honest, I'm a gamer and this is my gaming buddy. I pull up ESO maps and One Note allows me to mark up the maps I find online to check off what I've accomplished, rearranged, plan, it's incredible2. Versatility  I watch a lot of movies and tv on my advice. It's comfortable, easy to hold, just the right size screen, phenomenal graphics and good sound  As previously stated, I read on my device  I am a student. I Word Process. A LOT  I am an Excel nut. I spreadsheet like a crazy person. I attach a mouse and organize my life.  I spend a ton of time using video conferencing on this thing3. Physical Perfection (OK so it is not as light as your tablet but for what it can do, totally worth the extra weight which isn't that much)  Just the right size screen which is totally touch and pen friendly  Good battery life and easy and fast to charge. Not so happy about the way the charger connects with the longer part of the charger pointing down which makes it super easy to accidentally dislodge the magnet (CON 1)In my opinion, this is the perfect electronic for my lifestyleSo, what's wrong with it?Only one USB port and no place to insert extra storage or portable storage without using your only USB portNo MICRO SD Card slotThe Charger connection is A. Not universal and B. Stupidly located. You'd think Microsoft would have figured out by now that if you use a laptop ON your lap it'll get disconnected due to poor locationBUY THE KEYBOARD! If you want a tablet, buy a tablet, If you want a computer you need a keyboard why doesn't it just come with one?Bottom line is this. If you need something versatile and not specialized, this is your computer. It's worth the money. If you're looking for something to run a specialized program or a gaming computer, this is probably not your computer. It's not the most powerful device on the market but it is by FAR the most versatile. I could not recommend a better device for students. Buy a protective case, throw it in your backpack, purse, tote, car, suitcase, whatever let it become a part of you, you won't regret it. It is my travel buddy carrying my movies, books and work with me wherever I need to go.","Microsoft Surface Pro 7 – 12.3"" Touch-Screen - 10th Gen Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory – 1TB SSD – Platinum","$2,300.00",reviews3.csv

Sitting on the table in sleep mode took 33% of the battery after 12 hours. I wouldn't think that would deplete the battery just sitting there.  May have to find out if that can be replaced.

7,7,Anthony,"February 23, 2020",1.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t buy the surface pro 7 from amazon,"Well where do i start..... i ended up getting my item and everything was good for about 20mins of use... however after 20mins my screen would freeze for 10-30 secs. I blew it off at first but then it happen 10mins after then it became a often issue. So i ended up going for an exchange. (The worst idea I’ve ever had). I called up amazon and told them my issue and they were quick to get me a replacement so as first i was satisfied until the surface pro 7 came in the next day. I open the box to find out the box it comes in is not only damage but in a renewed box didn’t even come in the same box it should have come in, then i open that to see the surface pro and the screen film wrapped around it was really dirty as if they dropped it in dirt or so and fingerprints all over the machine. So at this point I’m just hoping it works. This one was not charged at all at 15% like it usually is if you were to buy from Microsoft or an apple device would normally be. So i put it on the charger to find out that it not only has screen tear straight down the middle of the screen but a big red dot half the size of the screen was on there as if they drop the surface pro. So at this point i immediately call amazon and i talked to a representative that ended up giving me a hard time about another replacement even though this one was obviously there fault. So i ended up talking to a supervisor that ended up giving me a hard time as well and in the she said to me that they only do a exchange once but as a one time exception they’ll do the exchange to which i responded with i only want to do the exchange if it’s a brand new product that they are giving me not a renewed one and undamaged. To which she agreed that she would make sure it would be done and put in her notes so the wear house  knows. Well the next day came and guess what.... the man that drops it off throws my package at the wall of my house from a big distance he didn’t see me at all so when i raced over the man jumped in his car and quickly drove away knowing what he did. Not only this but when i open the box the surface pro again was in a dirty renewed box, at this point I’m just hoping it still even worked again no power so i plug it in and guess what it works surprisingly after all that. However i Notice something was different with the boot up process so i knew something was wrong i go to the setting of the computer and the version i bought was 8gb of ram i5 model with 128gb of memory the one i receive as a replacement this time was a 4gb version i5 model with 128gb of memory and GUESS WHAT A DIFFERENT GRAPHICS CARD AS WELL. The surface pro 7 i got not only had 4gb of ram which was wrong but a different graphics card as well that comes in a surface pro 5 are you serious.... so i called up customer service again asking for a supervisor yet again..... just wanting a refund the man told me well i see here that you have a couple of exchange for this device already so i told him this story i am telling now and ask him i wonder why i have “a couple of exchanges” to which he said well instead of a refund i can get you a brand new one and told me how he had to make a couple of phone calls to do this for me so i told him this is the last exchange I’ll be getting ill be asking for a refund next like i previously wanted..if the next one comes in the renewed box which that would mean it’s used.. if it’s broken or the wrong model I’m done with trying and I’m done with the surface pro 7. not only was this the worst experience with amazon that I’ve ever had and worst costumer Service but now I’m going to hate the surface pro 7 because of this. I’ll see what i receive next as of 02/23/2020Sorry for the long review but i felt my experience should be shared for others to see.","Microsoft Surface Pro 7 – 12.3"" Touch-Screen - 10th Gen Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory – 1TB SSD – Platinum","$2,300.00",reviews3.csv
8,8,M. P,"October 17, 2020",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great tablet and touch screen computer for travel- limited apps available though,"Great for travelers who need a functional computer that can also serve as a tablet. I got th Surface Pro 7 because I travel for work and will also be starting grad school so I may need to study on the plane or after work in the hotels. I wanted the full functionality of a computer that would allow me to use MS Office programs as well as the functionality of a touch screen, tablet and inking feature to take notes for class. I am just getting accustomed to the inking feature but I can see that it will be a great asset to me during my program and I enjoy the overall portability of the Microsoft Surface Pro 7.  The screen size is just right for me as I don’t like large computers. I have also purchased a wireless keyboard and mouse for when at home to make it even easier to use when typing papers or working on projects. I also purchased a cute flowered skin with white. sage, pink and gray to protect the metal from any nicks or scratches.  I also purchased the silver pen and got a sage green skin to protect it. I like that the pen magnetically attaches to the side of the Surface Pro 7 and that the pen can erase using the eraser on the pen. The only reason I gave it four rather than five stars is that I am finding that not all apps are offered in the Surface Pro that I currently have. The selection seems quite limited and you can’t get apps from iTunes or Google Play as neither service is compatible with Windows. I am most disappointed that Scribd is not offered as I was hoping to be able to read books while in flight. I have read that there is VM Ware apps that may work. I am not very technical so I don’t know much about it. I appreciate any suggestions from Microsoft or techies on how I can upload Scribd on my Surface Pro 7.

The battery life is nowhere near what is advertised. On battery saving mode, using only Onenote for taking class notes, it lasts about 4 hours. Fortunately it charges up very quickly though. I can't see any way that I would get a full days use out of a full battery charge in any circumstance. In my case that is not very important because I am always around an outlet but if you need a tablet that will last all day away from a power source you will have a problem. The camera is good enough, not as good as the Apple camera, but I don't really use it as a camera anyway. I use mostly the 365 programs and find that it integrates these programs seamlessly. Onenote comes with the tablet and has been an amazing app for my vet school classes.  It saves my many hours of study time. My only issues are with the instability of Onenote. It closes itself down every few minutes and is very frustrating. I'm sure there is a fix for this but I'm also sure that I won't get it from Microsorft as they have a technical support team that is on par with the customer service team at the cable company. I've contacted them 3 times now and my issue is never addressed. I was actually told to contact Amazon since they sold it to me. It seems like after spending a thousand dollars on Microsoft products they would at least provide a bit of tech support.  I'll just have to scour the web for a fix to this I guess.

I did my research on the device before purchasing because I'm doing remote learning and an art major so I already knew what I wanted in a laptop and the pro 7 delivered!

Screen works perfect as a laptop/tablet and connects well with my hotspot. The only downside is that I paid so much hoping for the sim card or esim option to be there but it wasn't and although the battery still needs improvement I find that if you allow the laptop to rest every hour the battery drains less. I work so I don't have to use it every second but something to keep in mind.Update: Turns out this laptop has a tendancy to freeze a lot, so if your wifi is top tier you should have no worries. When I use public wifi (which I hate doing), im able to load pages etc. When i use my hotspot (not on my phone) it takes 5 minutes just to load a simple search. This wasn't the case when i first got it, and I even increased the gigs on my hotspot just for it to run.

I'm primarily using it as a writing tablet and e-reader for part-time grad school, and I'd like to start using it for work (engineer). It's improved my workflow a ton. The Surface Pen is great and the magnet makes for a very secure attachment. I considered the Surface Pro X, because it has an option for stowing the slim pen in its keyboard but opted for the regular surface pen after trying them out in a retail store.I've deducted one star because:The large bezel. Doesn't bother me much at all, but it really doesn't stack up to competitor designs in 2019/2020. Still looks very sleek overall.Windows 10 works surprisingly well in tablet mode, but Microsoft is really missing an opportunity by not having a good built-in or Office e-reader (epub, pdf, mobi support) with pen support for document/ebook markup. Edge doesn't cut it feature-wise. Luckily there's a popular app in the Microsoft Store called Drawboard PDF that works really well. The lack of Microsoft application support for critical Surface features is another reason for deducting a star! OneNote and other apps were great on here. I'd love to try an MS designed e-reader with pen support.","Microsoft Surface Pro 7 – 12.3"" Touch-Screen - 10th Gen Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory – 1TB SSD – Platinum","$2,300.00",reviews3.csv

I had to get one for myself. Since I didn't find another 8gb surface go model, I went w/ the Pro 7 i5/8gb model myself. I am in love with this device. Watching netflix is great,  Illustrator and other drawing software works great w/ the surface pen. Keyboard took a few minutes to get the hang of it and I quite enjoy it, it works well. It is a bit heavy when holding it w/ one hand (this is why I loved the Surface GO version for normal tablet use) but it is quite light overall.Also tested a few games and it actually surprised me a bit tacking into account this is the i5 model. I am able to play Halo Reach just fine, (note that I had to lower the resolution down to 1080p) and it plays good. Minecraft plays really well. I didnt actually get this for gaming ( lol ) but it plays light games just great (of course it gets warm w/ Reach). StardewValley FTW! Currently this is my primary device and it performs extremely well. If you have the extra cash, do go for the i7 model mainly for the 16gb of RAM.

0,0,Edwin C,"July 11, 2020",5.0 out of 5 stars,The complete package Windows Ultrabook. This should be the de facto Macbook alternative!,"If you don't want a MacBook Air/Pro because of macOS, or other Windows manufacturers such as Dell/HP/Lenovo have let you down in the past, the Surface Laptop 3 (i7 1065G7, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD, Matte Black) is quite the option. In my opinion it's the best premium Ultrabook on the market, especially impressive as Microsoft has only been at it for about 3 years.As performance between 85% of Ultrabooks is relatively similar, build and design is a big deciding factor to me, and the Surface won out against worthy competitors such as the Dell XPS 13 (9300), HP Spectre x360 13, and Razer Blade Stealth. A lot of Microsoft + Intel intangibles like Instant On, smart backlighting, and adaptive brightness help this feel like a polished machine that's been innovated for over 10+ years like the XPS lineup.The display on the Surface is excellent. The resolution is higher than standard full HD (not quite QHD because of the 3:2 aspect ratio), and doesn't sacrifice on either battery life (4K Ultrabooks make no sense) or picture quality. Apple and Microsoft seem to be the only ones who believe in making QHD+ displays for 13-14"" instead of 4K. It just makes more sense for everyone.Performance is great for a 15W laptop, although I don't need much horsepower from my laptop as I have other desktops for heavy workloads. It's good in short bursts, and at lasting long. The quad core i7-1065G7 has the highest level graphics config for Intel's Ice Lake processors, so this is as good as it gets for this generation. I would recommend 95% of buyers to just buy the 8GB RAM models, as you'll find more use in just having 4 cores than 16GB RAM.Battery life is good, not amazing. I get about 6-7 hours of active use out of a full charge. It can top up pretty fast while in sleep mode with the included Surface Connect charger. Coming from a device that gave me 2 hours max off of battery, I'm not asking for much. There is some endurance left to be desired, but it's enough for what I need.The touchpad and keyboard are amazing. They're both among the best that Windows Ultrabooks have to offer (although that's not saying much..)Some minor gripes/annoyances:-Intel's Bluetooth and Wi-Fi drivers seem to mess with reception on this device. My range with my Bluetooth headphones is unexpectedly shorter than usual. When waking the device from sleep, Wi-Fi takes a long time to reconnect properly; I sometimes have to restart the machine to get online.- I knew that ordering a matte black metal device would be a challenge to keep clean, but yeah.. pretty hurts doesn't it?Overall, I think this should be the default recommendation for a Windows Ultrabook. at $1299 for the i5, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD, value isn't the best but you have what is the best looking Ultrabook on the market other than the new XPS 13.","Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 – 13.5"" Touch-Screen – Intel Core i7 – 16GB Memory - 256GB Solid State Drive – Sandstone","$1,149.00",reviews4.csv

(Music Production/Graphics Processing)","I purchased this machine because I recently purchased several Native Instruments plugins for use with my application copy of Fruity Loops. My old computer was struggling to even eek out a full measure without crackling or stuttering, so it was time.This computer is simultaneously running FLStudio with multiple heavy Native Instrument channels without any stutter. I will say that it initially did have a little lag, but upping the buffer threshold has taken care of it. I have seen some complain that the I7 processor is insufficient for heavy music production, but if you are concerned about that, look up a tutorial about turning off the turbo boost since this should rectify the problem that many described.As for graphics, I have been using Flowscape to create ambient animated scenes, and the processor deals with this as well as most high end laptops would. I had a scene with thousands of animated 3d models (plants and particle effects included), and the framerate hovered around 8-10, which is fine for the initial setup of the scene. When I rendered it, it output about 1 frame per second at 4k quality, and the end result was as smooth as butter.Beyond that, it is a good quality, metal body, extremely high resolution machine with a lot of power for only weighing 2 pounds. If you are producing music with 30 different instruments or if you are a professional animator or heavy gamer, then you probably already know that you should spring for a tower with adequate cooling and hardware. If you enjoy moderate/heavy mixing and casual graphics work, this machine is absolutely perfect.The only warning I have is that this does not come with an SD slot.

One time the laptop was off and wouldn’t turn on, simple google on the phone and already had a fix for it. Also had to turn off the auto adjust for the screen brightness as it was overly sensitive and would constantly fluctuate.All in all, I’m happy with my purchase. There are some things I’d like to be fixed, but I wasn’t willing to spend the money for an even more expensive laptop so I feel like while it is on the costly side, it’s a huge upgrade from what I had and it’s held up great for the past 3 months.","Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 – 13.5"" Touch-Screen – Intel Core i7 – 16GB Memory - 256GB Solid State Drive – Sandstone","$1,149.00",reviews4.csv
3,3,Jon Gilbert,"April 13, 2021",2.0 out of 5 stars,"I probably would not buy this again, for a few different reasons","I probably would not buy this again, for a few different reasons.First let's talk about the magsafe-esque power cord. It's not easy to know if it's actually plugged in: it'll snap to the housing if it's close, but that doesn't mean that it's snapped *into* the port. The light indicating the cable is attached in on the side, so if you're looking down at it you can't tell if it's lit. The power supply is a brick with square, sharp bevels, and I'm left wondering with the low power draw why an existing USB-C port wasn't used.The trackpad is mostly unusable. It's large, which I thought would be great, but that means that while typing minor brushes against it with the meat of my thumb and palm move or re-orient the cursor. Thought you were in this window typing? Nope, now you're over there and half your password is in a slack channel. The Windows 10 setting for ""disable trackpad while typing"" doesn't do that reliably enough to keep it from happening. And, sometimes two-finger scrolling just doesn't work: it'll be fine for hours, then noooope: you are gonna have to drag the cursor over to the scrollbar in the window for about 10 minutes. The trackpad needs to be disabled and an external mouse needs to be used.On the topic of an external mouse: there goes the single USB-A port.When we talk about the bevel, it's impossible to know where the ports along the left-hand side are without lifting the laptop and looking: a small indented dimple or a sticker would go very far towards knowing where to plug in my earphones.Battery life, weight, screen brightness are all relatively par, there's nothing to exclaim or dismiss there. It is a very thin device, but one that still needs an unshapely brick if you want to do anything. It's not a *terrible* device, but it really doesn't do much to make itself *good*, and all the minor and obnoxious annoyances about it add up to a device that you probably don't want.","Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 – 13.5"" Touch-Screen – Intel Core i7 – 16GB Memory - 256GB Solid State Drive – Sandstone","$1,149.00",reviews4.csv

However one gripe I had about the Pro series was screen tilt, especially when trying to video chat. Unlike traditional laptops, you can't tilt the screen forward, which makes for awkward angles when video chatting or watching movies, etc. I decided to go with Surface Laptop and I won't be going back! I love this computer. Screen size is awesome and display is clear. Touch is sensitive and responsive. Keyboard is comfortable. And the machine it self is gorgeous.

It is inconceivable that the computer would last one year and MS suggested I buy an extended warranty next time.  I suggested they build a better machine that is dependable.  I also put up with the clunky docking station that sometimes worked and sometimes did not.I am getting the refurbished machine but have every expectation that it won't last the year.

My old HP laptop fell onto the floor one too many times and broke apart so I needed a new laptop. I own and operate two small business, one of them is photography. I needed something that would allow me to smoothly import, edit, and export a large volume of photos. I do quite a few emails and invoicing for both businesses so I needed something quick and reliable. I was drawn to this laptop after doing extensive research on a bunch of laptops for about a week. I liked the build of it but also what it was capable of. It's important to have a high quality screen when editing photos and this laptop does not disappoint at all. The screen is beautiful.I'm a big fan of buying refurbished so that did not worry me at all. However this was my first time buying a refurbished laptop, and from Amazon at that. The laptop arrived in mint condition. It was basically brand new. I wouldn't have had a clue it had ever been used before. I've had it for almost a week now and have had no issues. I've sent email, edited photos, video called, and printed photos from it. It runs smoothly and very quickly. I also enjoy the touch screen option. All in all I am very happy with this laptop and I would recommend it.

0,0,Knightman,"October 31, 2020",4.0 out of 5 stars,Make sure you are okay with the compromises,"I am pleasantly surprised as I really like the surface laptop Go. I feel like Microsoft missed a home run here with the base model having 4 gb of ram and no fingerprint sensor and then having to go to the next trim at $699 to get the 8 gb ram and fingerprint sensor.  Result: ground rule double.Likes:Design:  it is a nice looking device that stands out from the others in its category. The ice blue is attractive while not the most obvious blue still retains a nice look. The plastic underside does not detract from this either.Size:  It is compact and fairly light.Screen: Despite the sub 1080p resolution, the screen is still attractive and bright with accurate colors.  The 3:2 aspect ratio also makes this a hit because the screen is taller and easier to review documents, because you have to scroll less than a 16:9 aspect ratio.Color options: there are 3 different color options to choose from, options are always good.Ports:  having usb-c and a is great as well as having the device charge from USB-c along with the mag connector for charging.Trackpad:  this is on the nicest trackpads I have ever used as my fingers glide across it.  Mouse movement is great.Price: the base model starts at $550.Fingerprint reader: nice and fast logonPerformance:  all models have an i5 processor and I think this is more than fine for everyday users, even the base model will give you good performance.Neutral:Keyboard: it is okay to type on for me and not as good as the pixelbook go keyboard because it has a somewhat mushy feeling when typing.Screen: it is nice but still it is under 1080p for a device that cost $550 and up. When was the last time you found a device that was not full hd for $500 or up?Sound: I think it sounds decent, not amazing, not a pro or con.Base Model: 4 gb really microsoft you could not have just put an extra 4 gigs in and charge $599.  Why limit it this way? Also no fingerprint reader in base model as well.Battery life: it is in the 7-8 hours territory.  Not amazing but not awful either.Cons:Keyboard: no backlight.  This is the biggest con again when is the last time you had a device over $500 with no backlit keyboard.  It makes typing in poorly lit rooms more difficult and a no fly zone for those who work in darkness.Price:  on the highest tier model Microsoft is really trying to upcharge you just for added storage.$899 just highlights this device's shortcomings even more in that price bracket.Wrap up:  I looked over a bunch of devices in this class and some not in its class.  This is not the quintessential device for me but it is very good.  My biggest gripe is the lack of backlit keyboard on a device in this price range.  I find the screen is very nice looking but the sub 1080p comes across as tacky also.  I feel they could have popped an i3 in the base model and then added the fingerprint sensor.  Avoid the $899 model as that is too much to pay for something so compromised.Also consider:  The Surface laptop 3 is something to consider if you are worried about the compromises being made. It has a backlit keyboard, a full HD+ display and is larger at 13.5 screen display.  It does cost more, and also the bezel around the display is larger.","Microsoft Surface Laptop Go - 12.4"" Touchscreen - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - 256GB SSD - Platinum",$629.00,reviews6.csv

Having an SSD vs eMMC for storage and an i5 for a processor makes this feel much snappier than other similar laptops in this class.

The charger is similar to Apple's chargers in the sense that you can put in in any direction and it should still charge. Well, my charger right out of the box was already problematic and I had to angle it just right to get my laptop to charge.  Fast forward to last night and my charger just stops working.

7,7,deljacla,"February 4, 2021",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Some good, some bad.","Edit to original review: This laptop is absolutely horrible. I have not used it for barely ANYTHING because the processor is horrible. I used it to make projects with my printer and cutting machine. The bluetooth disconnects and ruins materials. It literally takes 3 hours to print and cut one sticker sheet because the computer freezes CONSTANTLY. I have zero problems using a different computer for these tasks. The touchpad is also so sensitive that you can’t even use it. You basically HAVE to buy a separate mouse. I hate this laptop and I am NEVER buying another computer from Microsoft. I was prompted to update the OS, and I did and now I can not even start using the computer because I get a MILLION Microsoft ads! How many times must I close Bing windows about Black Friday?!?! This is insanely obnoxious. Every time I change the default browser from Bing to something that doesn’t suck, it changes it back to Bing and I also get a million pop ups about more Microsoft products that I don’t want! It gives me pop ups constantly about emails I never set up ! Do NOT waste your money. This laptop has done nothing but waste TONS of time, money, and my last ounce of patience. I am literally going to smash it with a sledgehammer. Today.Original:  I needed a much better laptop. Initially I was looking for a 2-in-1 (tablet and laptop). I watched some videos and narrowed my selections down. So I knew what to expect going in. Other reviews mentioned how the keyboard is not backlit. I thought this wouldn’t bother me much but now that I have it, it’s pretty annoying, especially because it is a common complaint and surely it is an easy fix, right? This was the cheapest of the 4 new computers I was looking at, and this was $850 with my selection. I probably should have spent a little more I guess. Then I realize that the screen does not detach like the Microsoft Surface Pro 7. Grrr. The screen doesn’t even fold back flat and you can’t use the Surface Pro pen on the screen either!! Gee, must be really good otherwise, right? Not so much. Comes with a ton of bloatware. If you want to use apps you probably use everyday, you have to disable safety mode, or only use Microsoft apps and nobody does that. I do like the aesthetic of the laptop, and the keyboard actually reminds me of my MacBook which has an ancient OS now. The touchpad is great, and so is the keyboard other than no backlighting. It turns on fast! However, this kind of freaked me out: The second time I turned it on, the laptop wasn’t facing me and I already used my finger to unlock it (I thought) but it didn’t work until I got in front of the computer. It made me wonder if it was using my face to unlock like my MacBook. Then it immediately said I was logged into a videoconferencing app that I have never used. I didn’t even realize that app was on this computer and I never created an account for it. I guess Microsoft does what it wants. I removed that app and many more. That was all a big turn off for me. But honestly the biggest complaint is the horrible graphics. My eyesight is not as great as it once was but honestly, the pixelation is bad and noticeable. I installed a photo editing app and even when blowing high resolution images up to edit, it looks worse than really cheap laptops I had 20 years ago. No exaggeration. I have tested this with hundreds of images now. Believe the reviews that mention this! My husband can’t stand when I watch TV on standard definition and that has never bothered me but this screen just looks distorted. I do like that it is small and lightweight. I can slip it in my nightstand and jump on it quickly for quick work stuff and that is great. But I am underwhelmed. Just really consider what the majority of reviewers complain about. If you’re considering any of the Microsoft Surface computers, other models have more to offer.","Microsoft Surface Laptop Go - 12.4"" Touchscreen - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - 256GB SSD - Platinum",$629.00,reviews6.csv

The only thing I don't like is having to  'Sign In' all the time but I'll look up how to resolve that.  The keys feel nice; they are not backlit, but I have a little bendable USB plug-in light which illuminates the keyboard but not the entire room.

9,9,Lydia,"December 15, 2020",4.0 out of 5 stars,Solid Basic Laptop,"I purchased this for work, I originally had the Surface Pro 4 tablet. My work consists of lots of emails, designing marketing promotions and ads in Canva, Microsoft Office (powerpoint, excel and word). So nothing too crazy. I will say when I was moving files over, side by side there is a difference in picture quality. The Surface Pro 4 tablet has a very sharp picture. The Laptop Go is a little fuzzier. I can get used to it and for the price, this is a great laptop (the tablet was about $1,000+). I can feel my eyes straining a little bit to read which may not be great in the long run, so I would say if you're not using this for 40 hours a week you'd be fine. If you are, I recommend either getting a different laptop or upping the font to help eye strain.In regards to the seller, they are awesome. I got the computer quickly. I reached out to them to ask about the resolution and they were quick to respond, and asked that I go to Microsoft to discuss.

This 8 ram Surface go so far has been doing very well for my needs. It price is a few $100 less then the Apple and it seems just as quiet as the Air. The screen is pretty good not as good as the air but if you don't have them side by side you won't know the difference. I did find a clear plastic cover to fit over my Surface go on Ebay. The cover I got for the Apple Air was easer to find then the one for the Go. All in all so far this laptop seems well built and I'm very happy with how well it works and how well it's built.

It does get overwhelmed and slow down when I'm in 2 or more Google Classrooms simultaneously and have open multiple windows and 20+ tabs, but I don't think the laptop is to blame, more the crazy demands of virtual teaching. The camera is a huge upgrade from my 2011 Asus laptop. WARNING: there's only 1 usb port, so that Anker multi-port plug-in is a MUST.

Oh damn, that should have been a clue. They don't stand behind their products with support or warranty...","Microsoft Surface Laptop Go - 12.4"" Touchscreen - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - 256GB SSD - Platinum",$629.00,reviews6.csv

We tried to contact Microsoft, but found out that they don't let you contact them in any way.  So now we have a brand new laptop that we need to charge constantly.

1,1,Eliza G,"May 4, 2020",3.0 out of 5 stars,Too clever by half,"I thought I could live with only 2 USB ports. But I can't. Guys, sometimes less is not more. This is a PITA to get all of my peripherals connected to. My bad. I saw there were only 2 ports. Even with a docking station, this is incredibly annoying.  Even the Surface Pro has more. Sigh.I thought with the extra memory and larger hard drive, it wouldn't run hot, but it often does.Maybe these 2 points are clouding my views. Anyway, having had a total of 3 surface products, all I can say is that this is my least favorite. By far. Not worth the crazy amount of money.","Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 – 15"" Touch-Screen – AMD Ryzen 7 Surface Edition - 16GB Memory - 512GB Solid State Drive – Matte Black","$1,599.00",reviews7.csv

4,4,A Jones,"March 8, 2020",1.0 out of 5 stars,Faulty Laptop - Thin Blue vertical line on screen that cant be removed,"Buying this laptop was a bad mistake. I bought it in Jan and did not open it until late Feb / early march, I now realise that not opening it and checking the computer as soon as I received it was a huge mistake. When I did open it about 4 weeks later I realised it was faulty and now I'm stuck with the laptop as the refund option has disappeared from my Amazon purchase history.Upon turning on the laptop I noticed a thin blue vertical line on the left of the screen. I tried to find a solution on Google only to discover that the likely culprit is a hardware issue either with the display or graphics card. Today I logged into my Amazon account only to realise that the ""return/refund"" button is no longer there, so I am stuck with a new laptop that has a blue line down the screen. I tried to do a screen capture to show the blue line but the line does not appear in the screen capture, so this to me indicates that its the LED itself which is faulty. I have never heard of or seen this before. I decided to take some picture with my phone, here you will see the line, it looks black in the photos but its actually blue.Amazon or seller please help as I need this laptop replaced or refunded.","Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 – 15"" Touch-Screen – AMD Ryzen 7 Surface Edition - 16GB Memory - 512GB Solid State Drive – Matte Black","$1,599.00",reviews7.csv

I waited 4 days before writing this review just to really test the laptop. And the problem that I have with the laptop a lot of other people also have it  (Don't trust the reviews on youtube because they most likely get paid by this trash company). I only used the laptop to watch youtube and some live streams and noticed the fan gets loud for no reason + heating problem + sometimes it lags and you have to restart the browser + brightness is so bad,  no matter how high or low it's It doesn't feel comfortable looking at the screen. There's no point in replacing it because a lot of other people have done it and the same problems occurred. This's the last time I buy anything from Microsoft and i hope they get sued for scamming and selling a defective product!","Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 – 15"" Touch-Screen – AMD Ryzen 7 Surface Edition - 16GB Memory - 512GB Solid State Drive – Matte Black","$1,599.00",reviews7.csv
