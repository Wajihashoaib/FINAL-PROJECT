10,Stace,"January 31, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great speeds, so lightweight, efficient","Huge upgrade from my old Lenovo IdeaPad. Much faster for everything, and it barely weighs anything. Very convenient, looks slick, and I actually enjoy using my laptop again instead of getting frustrated with it.Some reviews online mentioned issues with the bottom of it being too thin and the mouse clicking when you're just holding the laptop - I've had it for 3 months now and that hasn't happened even once. I carry it around from living room to home office pretty often too. No issues with that.The only issue I've had is with using Citrix Workspace with dual monitors - I have a docking station and 2 work monitors hooked up to the laptop, and they work great with no issues most of the time. Using Citrix to remote in, only 1 monitor works; the other 2 are always frozen.","Samsung Galaxy Book Pro Windows 11 Intel Evo Platform Laptop Computer 15.6"" AMOLED Screen 11th Gen Intel Core i7 Processor 16GB Memory 512GB SSD Long-Lasting Battery, Mystic Blue",&1049
11,Amber W,"March 22, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,My new gaming laptop!,"The battery life may be a little lower than I'd like, but that may be because I'm running graphics-heavy stuff. I didn't expect this, but it will run World of Warcraft. A little old-school maybe, so I'm not sure how well it will handle newer games, but it's every bit as good as my 4-year-old desktop machine.Oh yeah, and it does all the other stuff too. Webpages load in a flash. And it's got a fingerprint reader for logging into the computer, which isn't exactly new but I still think is cool.

I'm glad I saw this beautiful laptop. It's super lightweight, great screen quality, fast, I use it everyday! The battery life is the only thing I would say is a con.

13,TheIronFreak722,"March 31, 2022",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Great portability, nice look, but not worth the price.","This laptop caught my eye when I was in the market for a new one. I needed something solid for university, and this came into my feed. Needless to say, I was intrigued, but this laptop has some major flaws.The good things about this laptop really have to do only with the sleek, slender and portable design and the fact that it is extremely portable and easy to carry around. Everything else was incredibly underwhelming for the price tag.The hinges on the laptop are flimsy, and not secure. Typing on the laptop rattles the screen and is an unpleasant feature when on a video call for example. The touchpad is one of the worst touchpads I've ever seen, you can feel it click through the bottom of the laptop and you can also accidentally click while just scrolling. It is very poorly designed and not something you'd expect from a $1000+ laptop.Software is abysmal! Constant freezing, flickering and it blue screened 3 times with me within the first WEEK! Fan noise can be tuned out but the performance of this laptop is worse than my $250 Acer laptop from 2020.I figured some of the negative reviews were all bs, so I thought I'd bite. What a poor, empty excuse for a laptop. I'm hoping I just got some faulty unit but that still doesn't make up for everything else.Avoid this laptop. Hoping the Galaxy Book 2 pro is better than this!","Samsung Galaxy Book Pro Windows 11 Intel Evo Platform Laptop Computer 15.6"" AMOLED Screen 11th Gen Intel Core i7 Processor 16GB Memory 512GB SSD Long-Lasting Battery, Mystic Blue",&1049
14,JM,"March 29, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Unfortunately runs HOT,"Just got it today, to replace my last samsung that died after nearly 7 years.  I have been using it for approx 4 hours for work.  This one runs HOT.  The loud fan, which sounds like an airplane taxiing to the terminal just after landing, stays on 90% of the time.  The fan on my old samsung which was the same but the 2015 version, rarely came on and when it did, almost was unnoticeable because it was quiet. Its in the low 60s here today, house heater is off. Not sure why.  Everything else seems to be ok so far.

The second time was a month after I received it back from repair, and the screen simply stopped working even though the computer was on and working in the background, reducing me to operating only with a external monitor. now fighting with them to take it back again.

I am EXTREMELY picky about keyboards on laptops. This one is perfect. The buttons are spaced out nicely, but not too far apart, and there is a number pad. The colors look magnificent- it is extremely fast- I haven't had any problems with windows 11 so far. I've had this laptop almost three months. The battery life could be better, but I gave it five stars because it still lasts what I feel is a long time, and it charges back up quickly- even when you're on it while it is charging.I love the backlight on the keyboard- perfect for using at night while you're in bed. I've owned Asus, acer, lenovo, hp, dell. This is bar far the best thing I have ever had and used. I use it for school, writing, surfing, and researching. I can get a million tabs open sometimes and it still runs fast!","Samsung Galaxy Book Pro Windows 11 Intel Evo Platform Laptop Computer 15.6"" AMOLED Screen 11th Gen Intel Core i7 Processor 16GB Memory 512GB SSD Long-Lasting Battery, Mystic Blue",&1049

33,DiegoS,"February 22, 2022",1.0 out of 5 stars,Screen cracks out of nowhere and Samsung blames you,"Screen cracked out of normal  and really carefull use.I reached customer support, who says I have to pay for the repair since it is a physical damage, and basically they consider that my fault.It's clearly a design problem: cover material is too thin, so it bends easily and it has a little jump between the space bar and the touch screen, that is where usually crackes.It is one month and a half old, I never used it as a tablet and never used the pen. It cracked just by transporting it in my cushioned backpack.BTW, if you pay the repair, they replace the parts with the same ones, so it will happen again. Basically if you want to avoid screen to crack, you need to use it as a desktop. Forget about transporting it , tablet, touch screen or pen features.Don't ever trust Samsung customer support. This product has one serious design issue and they give you their back.","Samsung Galaxy Book Pro Windows 11 Intel Evo Platform Laptop Computer 15.6"" AMOLED Screen 11th Gen Intel Core i7 Processor 16GB Memory 512GB SSD Long-Lasting Battery, Mystic Blue",&1049

Only problem was that I wasn't ready to make the purchase.  A month or so later my old heavy laptop starting having issues and of course, the sale was over.  In any event I saw that this same model was a bit more and decided to make the purchase.  No regret! I LOVE this light weight ""evo"" Samsung 15 inch laptop.  I do travel and carrying the old heavy one was a strain carrying it around.  This 16 Ram lightweight laptop is fast, starts up fast, plenty of storage and overall is a great laptop for the price.  Lastly, with today's applications you need a minimum of 12 RAM . Not 8. Better yet 16 Ram which gives you enough power to run those games (like Warcraft) and upload/download programs in a flash!

35,Rob S,"January 22, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Like night and day,"The last laptop I bought - a Lenovo - had an optical drive. So nearly a decade old. But it was a total workhorse for work and home use. And needed replacement.After *lots* of reading and research I landed on the Samsung Galaxy Book Pro, in no small no part because my Samsung Galaxy 10+ phone has done so well.Also? This was in stock! Several others I looked at were either out when I started looking, or went to backorder while I was on the hunt. And the Amazon 5-payment plan was a little kinder on my budget.Screen is incredible. Backlit keyboard. RAM is nearly triple what my old machine had (16gb v 6), so using Photoshop now is no big deal while I'm using several other apps simultaneously. It sure used to be. And it takes about a second - yep - once you flip the screen open to wake.Downside? It's *very* thin and *very* light compared to my old machine, so that's taken some getting used to. I need to hold it in place while I open the screen. And right now it actually sits ON the old one when I'm working. But it's still new yet.Looks like it's a bit more expensive now ( I paid about $1100) but I think still a deal for what you'll be getting, esp if you haven't upgraded in a while as was my case.Highly recommend.","Samsung Galaxy Book Pro Windows 11 Intel Evo Platform Laptop Computer 15.6"" AMOLED Screen 11th Gen Intel Core i7 Processor 16GB Memory 512GB SSD Long-Lasting Battery, Mystic Blue",&1049
36,Mary,"February 21, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very light, Screen looks really good, but get hot/warm and battery not what they say.","So, plugged it in and did the many many updates. The whole left side from top to bottom row not space bar got hot and all the way over to the 6 key. It was plugged in when this happened just doing the setup. On the battery the y-under side gets warm and this was just surfing the web. It is really light, the screen is really nice. It is not a touch screen which doesn't bother me, but Windows 11 is geared more to the touch screen. The battery will not last 20 hours like they say in description. I just did 1 hour of surfing and I lost 25% of the battery just surfing.All in all it is a good laptop for now. We got it on sale so I grab it. I got the midnight blue, wanted the white, but white was listed as Chrome OS and I wanted Windows. I  believe the laptop is worth it but we will test it more and try to update the review.update: still getting heat issues when downloading or sometimes just when charging on the left side of the unit.  when downloading tonight it got so warm and the fan was so loud trying to cool it off.","Samsung Galaxy Book Pro Windows 11 Intel Evo Platform Laptop Computer 15.6"" AMOLED Screen 11th Gen Intel Core i7 Processor 16GB Memory 512GB SSD Long-Lasting Battery, Mystic Blue",&1049
