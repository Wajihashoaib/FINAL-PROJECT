0,Michael A. F. Dalton,"December 2, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Maybe one of the best laptops ever made for Chromebook users?,"This is a review that I am going to try to keep brief, but I might fail. Here's why: The Samsung Galaxy Chromebook has had some of the most unfair reviews I have ever read about an inanimate object, and I'd like to clear the air of some of those comments.Let's start with the only thing I agree with from so many negative reviews, and that agreement is 'somewhat' at best, and that's the fact that the battery life is not all that great. Some would say it is terrible, I would say that is true if only going by specs alone. But, in real-life usage by a couch potato like myself, is a minor inconvenience. Why? Well, because I do not use my Chromebook in a manner that requires I run on battery power more than 3 or four hours at a time. If after something between 3 and 5 hours, I get low on battery I do what I have always done... I plug it in! I am not being silly, but serious. I plug it in and keep going for a while, then I unplug it and keep going some more.YES, I could not do that in the forest, at the beach, or on a long flight. But my use case does not require that any longer, like it did when I was an executive in the computer business, taking long flights.SO, if your use case or use model allows plugging in now and then, and 3-plus hours will get you what you need and you can plugin for a while at that point, THAT is what real-world usage is like for many many users of this machine.Next, and last, on the agreed-to complaints list of other reviews is that, yes, the machine does heat up sometimes, but no differently than does my $3500 Apple MacBook Pro every now and then. There isn't a lot to say about that, other than it is not constant nor always-so but does occur about as often and gets about as warm, as my Mac laptops have occasionally become.These two main points are in agreement with similar points on other reviews. But many, if not most, of the other points on clearly negative reviews, are less than objective or real-world, in my opinion.For example, I read a review that said the glass screen was so thin if was prone to break, and that the trackpad was just too small, that the hinges were terrible, that the keyboard was terrible, and on and on. All of which is categorically false, and is not a realistic appraisal of the machine, especially when compared with other very high-end laptops, such as some Apple models, some other high-end Chromebooks such as those from Samsung and Google's own offerings.Now... for the sweet sauce, the good points about this amazingly cool little machine... read on.This machine is thin... really thin. So much so, that for the 1st few days I found myself handling it like the newborn baby it was, but soon I reverted to treating it like a laptop computer. All to say this thing is built really well, AND that it is a top-tier piece of precision electronics like a high-end camera or sophisticated medical device. But while it is not unduly delicate, it does deserve a degree of understanding that it is not a 1-inch thick block of ABS plastic, so use and treat it accordingly.Next, the hinges, no complaints from me. Some reviewers claim they are lousy because the lid/screen will oscillate a bit when adjusted. True. And so does every really thin lid machine I have ever owned. Bu tin the real world, we don't do that, do we? We adjust the screen position and carefully, and it stays put.Next, the keyboard, it is every bit as good, and perhaps better than the keys on any Mac portable I've used for the past 5 plus years, in fact, I think it is a little bit better because the key-travel feels a little bit longer, which can make for better feedback and improved speed.No need to comment on the display, it's simply about as good as it can be. Literally. I don't think you can get a better screen on any laptop today. And many of the reviewers panned the machine because of a lack of 4K video material to consume. Someone should tell them it isn't the machine's issue, is it?Sound. The sound is fine, again, consider what you just purchased, it is not a Bose foldback bass design with an array of 6 drivers for sound. It is an amazingly thin laptop, and it sounds just fine. Does it get loud enough? Yes. Does it get really really really loud? No.The hinges are fine, too. My only complaint is that when fully opened into tablet-style, the lid doesn't lock into place, and my copy floated about 1/8th of an inch above the base unit when handheld at an angle. When in tablet configuration and laying flat, as on a desk or table, the lid was flush as it should be. A little annoying at most.All the great features you've read about are absolutely true of this machine. It is simply the best laptop I have ever owned. In terms of the build detail, it meets, and actually, IMPO surpasses, many if not all major laptop manufacturers' latest designs, especially in the Chromebook marketplace, where this machine may be the best, again, depending on your individual feature, functions, and use-case needs.Performance-wise the included i5 10th generation Clearlake U chipset seems to me to outperform or minimally to keep up with my 2015 Google Pixel Chromebook which used an i7 2.6Ghz processor married to 16GB of RAM. This machine I am reviewing has a chip that moves along at 1.6Ghz and throttles up to 3.9 (some spec sheets rate it above 4.x Ghz) and as such I have had zero performance issues even though it has 8 GB of RAM. So performance-wise, I am very pleased.Would I have been happy if I'd spent $1,000 (actually $999) on this machine? Well, my 2015 machined aluminum, best of breed, Google Pixel Chromebook (the second release in that brand/line) cost me over $1,200 when new, and I never looked back. This machine was discounted to $799 a year ago, and now that it is replaced with the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2, this original Galaxy Chromebook can be had for $599 new while inventory supplies are available. At that price, I would replace it in a micro-second if mine was damaged or lost.Those of us who have been Chromium OS and Chromebook pioneers have been rewarded with an ever increase of Chromebook capabilities in both the hardware and the apps and operating system. This machine, the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook (original version) is a real winner in every way, and while battery life is not top-of-class, this reviewer asserts that pretty much everything else is, and for $600, I am very happy with my purchase.I hope this review has been helpful, regardless of what you end up purchasing when shopping for your next Chromebook computer.","SAMSUNG 13.3” Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM,4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, Ultra Slim Design, Chrome OS, WiFi 6, Mercury Gray",&859

2,'grat,"February 17, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice chromebook with a problem,"For features, function, appearance, weight, and even price, it's hard to beat the Galaxy Chromebook.  Battery life is somewhat limited, but it makes up for it with a beautiful touch-screen, decent sound, and a (relatively) lightweight package.But Samsung has a serious quality-control issue going on.  I understand that things happen, and I don't expect every piece of electronics to be perfect-- however, when my first Galaxy Chromebook arrived, and it immediately sprang to life, the screen remained dark.  Multiple resets later, the screen still never even flickered.  No backlighting, and no apparent activity on the screen.  After contacting Amazon, who referred me to Samsung, Samsung came to the conclusion I had-- the screen wasn't connected internally.  Samsung suggested an Amazon replacement would be better than sending it to Samsung and waiting for the usual service turnaround, so I contacted Amazon, and arranged for a replacement.Two days later, the replacement shows up (both brand new, by the way-- no refurbs), and while the screen lights up in all it's glory, the battery charge indicator continues blinking.  The system will not charge.  The task bar doesn't show a battery AT ALL.  Open crosh with ctrl-alt-t, run 'battery_firmware info', and I'm told there is no battery.  *sigh*At this point, I've received two dead systems, and the project I bought it for has a time component.  Out of desperation, I did some investigation, and determined that removing the bottom cover is actually pretty easy, as was locating the connector for the battery.  A light press on the connector, followed by a noticeable click, and the system now has a functional battery.  The connector has a piece of clear yellow tape on top, suggesting Samsung knows this is a weak point.Basic quality control should include verifying the screen works, the charger works, and the battery works.  Obviously, neither Chromebook I received passed all three of these tests.This is a very nice piece of equipment, totally let down by a rushed production line.","SAMSUNG 13.3” Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM,4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, Ultra Slim Design, Chrome OS, WiFi 6, Mercury Gray",&859
3,Joseph Carino,"June 27, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great chromebook...battery sucks.,A very nice machine except the battery will last maybe 4 hours and then 2 hours to recharge.

4,Amazon Customer,"February 11, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,overall. a great device,"where would you get a laptop / chromebook with  4K UHD AMOLED touch screen, core i5. 256 ssd nvme storage and a great build quality weighing 2.29 pounds / 1.07 Kg for $568-$700 ?!.  A portable Amoled 13.3 inch monitor would probably cost around $700-1000 ! .  Yes the battery life is not great - about 4.5 -5 hours -  but I would not sit  that long on a single charge anyways and if I do I would plug it in or use a portable power bank.  What surprised me was  how good Chrome OS is, using it for the first time.  I think Chrome OS should be a mainstream operating system and windows 10/11 should be for an office environment.  On Chrome OS I use microsoft office , outlook, word and Excel downloaded from chrome web store, but most of the time I use it for reading , web browsing and youtube - and this is where the 4K Amoled is great.  Netflix should have a better arrangement with  Google / Chrome OS and should stream 4K videos and not just FHD 108P.","SAMSUNG 13.3” Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM,4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, Ultra Slim Design, Chrome OS, WiFi 6, Mercury Gray",&859
5,Joel C.,"November 17, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing build, top quality in everything!","I have like 5 days with my Chromebook and I have to say I replaced a brand new Lenovo Duet from March 2021 so, it was my first trial with ChromeOS and I loved it! Besides the OS, eventough Lenovo's equipment is a terrific equipment and value for the price and performs well for its segment, I wanted something more powerful because I use 70% for work and 30% personal matter. And I'm using my Samsung instead my work's Dell Latitude with latest core i7 vPro 16 GB RAM, the issue is portability and it uses 70% if its power in security stuff loaded by my company. And I gotta say Samsung Galaxy Chromebook performs waaay better.Everything in it it's perfect and as many almost all know, battery is an ""issue"" because does to last as long as regular Chromebooks but man, consider, the amazing 13.3 in 4K AMOLED screen takes its part of the juice, also the i5 processor if you demand for power but at the end, nothing to worry about if you reduce screen brigthness and have moderate usage. I was concerned about that but know I realize it is not the issue many say.I know I just jumped from top of bottom segment to top of top and belive me, once you do, there's no turning back. Fortunately there's a lot of more affordable options with great specs and just little more dimensions.","SAMSUNG 13.3” Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM,4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, Ultra Slim Design, Chrome OS, WiFi 6, Mercury Gray",&859
6,Kindle Customer1,"May 29, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great computer, bad battery.","TL;DR great computer with cool features but compromised battery for thinness. The first thing I have to say is that the screen quality is superb and paired with tablet mode is a defiant win in my book. The s pen is muchmore functional on a Note 20 ultra than a computer, it is a cool gimmick and makes presentations easier because of the red dot feature. The i5 is a medium stage processor, I was going to buy a dell with an i7 but decided that the i5 was good enough, the thinness is also extremely convenient having a decent computer without added weight. There are a few cons though, the battery life is comparable to the note 20 ultra running full boar. This computer also only runs chrome which can be a downside to some but not to me. The c charger on both sides is one of the best parts of this computer because now I only need the fast charger it came with to charge my phone, computer, or headphones. The lighted keyboard makes a big difference in the dark and the camera near the keyboard made to take photos in tablet mode is cool because it looks like a big note 20. It also says on streaming services that it is running 8k but the screen is only capable of 4k. Overall this is a good student computer and worth the money, but if you need the windows just buy the new galaxy book pro. 6.9inch note 20 ultra for scale, 1:1 scale on both s pens. Viewing screen size is the same as the note 20 ultra, about 1.5 the size of an s8+ of note 20 ultra thickness wise. This thing is phone thin. Samsung has yet to fail me.","SAMSUNG 13.3” Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM,4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, Ultra Slim Design, Chrome OS, WiFi 6, Mercury Gray",&859
7,Ron G.,"January 25, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,no aftermarket support. could not find a polycarbonate cover or keyboard cover,"I never used the computer. After trying to find a keyboard cover and hardshell cover, I came to realize per many reviews that the high resolution screen is battery intensive to a fault, as well as heat producing. Some say the battery will only last 4 hours. The large perforated area on the bottom is to dissipate the heat generated by the power hungry screen. Honestly, I just took it out of the box and put it back and returned it after realizing there were no keyboard covers or polycarbonate cases for this model. Although I never actually even turned it on, if you read the reviews and see the screen resolution, you will see why the aftermarket industry leaves it alone. I think the screen overburdens the device.","SAMSUNG 13.3” Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM,4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, Ultra Slim Design, Chrome OS, WiFi 6, Mercury Gray",&859
8,Jed Rothwell,"March 23, 2021",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not reliable. First unit and and replacement unit both crash and hang.,"This is a beautiful little Chromebook. It is light, with a high resolution screen, and a nice keyboard. Unfortunately, it is unreliable. I got one about a month ago. Several times a day it crashed. It stopped while I was working, or when I opened the top to turn it back on, it had crashed back to the sign-on screen with a message: ""Chrome didn't shut down correctly."" It also hung up, refusing to turn on until you held the power key for 20 seconds. Also, it did not work with the wi-fi extender. A ""powerwash"" reset did not help.Amazon gave me a replacement unit with no argument. It arrived yesterday. Yesterday it crashed once, and hung up once. Today it crashed again. Modern computer equipment is reliable so this is unusual. I do not think it is a coincidence that two out of two are unreliable.In my opinion, the designers put too much effort into strange features such as the stylus, and a non-working fingerprint detection key. (I finally got it to register after several attempts, but it does not sign on to anything.) They should have made it more reliable instead.I will probably keep it, because a Chromebook is more of a glorified i-Pad more than it is a computer. As long as you can browse, it is okay, even if it crashes unexpectedly. It has various applications such as word processing, but they are all the Google on-line versions, so you do not lose your work when it crashes. I will keep this one, but I would not recommend it to anyone.I recommend Chromebooks in general. For my purposes they are much better than laptop computers. I had another one for many years, from another maker. It never had problems like this. It finally died of old age, but it was reliable for a long time.FOLLOW UP: The replacement unit crashed 5 times in one day, so I returned it for a refund. Again, Amazon did not give me any trouble. They suggested I contact Samsung and tell them I had problems with two units. The woman at Samsung said, ""we have not heard of any problems like that."" I told her to come here to Amazon and read these reviews. I have a feeling that someone in their organization is not letting the bad news about this product spread through the company.","SAMSUNG 13.3” Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM,4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, Ultra Slim Design, Chrome OS, WiFi 6, Mercury Gray",&859
9,James Hawk,"May 14, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,4K AMOLED screen is beyond belief,"Despite the valid short battery life reports, I bought the Samsung as it was being discounted before new models were introduced, and very pleased with the speed and especially the jaw-dropping screen, and now it's dropped another hundred bucks - what a steal !  I'd read other raves about the 4K AMOLED screen (made by Samsung), but seeing was almost not believing.  Colors are so deep, so brilliant, and when you switch a YouTube video from regular high def to 4K resolution, it becomes crystal clear - best way to describe it is that it appears I'm looking at a real image through glass.  Specs for the 13.3 inch screen are 3840 X 2160 pixels, which some think is overkill but I disagree because of the pure viewing pleasure it provides.  The rest of the hardware is super fast and a quality build.  If you buy a newer version of this, just make sure it's got the 3840 x 2160 screen !","SAMSUNG 13.3” Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM,4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, Ultra Slim Design, Chrome OS, WiFi 6, Mercury Gray",&859

11,Paul Roger,"November 15, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Shockingly good,"Now, the main concern of course is battery but it isn't as diré as reviews show it to be anymore, updates really helped it out. I was extremely hesitant at buying from this company since very few people have and it was mixed but I'm glad I took the risk. Sellers responded to me soon enough and they sent me the device without a scratch, they should have labeled it like new and not just good as condition as people would get the wrong impression. All in all, I get to write a review about a 1000 dollar device I paid 550 for and I couldn't be happier!","SAMSUNG 13.3” Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM,4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, Ultra Slim Design, Chrome OS, WiFi 6, Mercury Gray",&859

13,C. Matthew Hawkins,"May 10, 2021",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice Design, But Unreliable Performance","The machine's design is sleek, video images are sharp and clear, the computer is lightweight, however, the big problem with this computer is that it is extremely buggy, which makes it unreliable if you are trying to get work done.Although the touch screen always seems to work well enough, you will lose many hours of productive time when the trackpad fails and, of course, it always fails at the most inconvenient times.Also, the backlight on the keyboard only works occasionally. There is no telling when it will or will not work. This makes the computer unreliable when it comes to getting work done. But it looks nice.The printed letters and numbers on the keyboard are often difficult to read due to a lack of contrast against the color of the keys. This means that you will occasionally have to squint and turn your head at odd angles to make sure your fingers are properly positioned, and this can slow you down. Moreover, although it is possible to find workarounds for the deficiencies of this machine, the flaws in its design, its hardware, and its software will kill the flow of your creativity.Overall, the item looks nice; it is visually appealing.

16,EGates,"February 21, 2021",2.0 out of 5 stars,Poorly designed for basic usage,"After all the positive reviews of this chromebook, I am very disappointed. Yes, it is sleek and lightweight, which I do appreciate.  However, many key design features make it really uncomfortable to use.  For starters, the screen is highly reflective - so much so, that it is difficult to see what is on the screen.  Right now, I have a beautiful view through the window behind me; however, I can barely see what I am typing.  I am constantly turning the screen brightness to the max simply to cut through the reflections.  Second, the contrast on the keyboard is way too low; the letters themselves are all but invisible.  The letters are light gray on medium grey keys.  So, I am also constantly turning up the brightness on the keyboard.  Last but not least, the webcam is really terrible - my image is fuzzy at best, and, unless the room is extremely bright, I am shrouded in darkness.  For some reason, this device has a high res cam that faces outwards, and another one which faces upwards (just above the keyboard).  Why are these so good, while the webcam is so bad?

Actually, the battery life isn't as bad as I was led to think by other reviewers. So long as I dial back the screen brightness a bit I get about five hours, which isn't too bad for my usage. But not a battery life champ. In every other respect, this laptop is definitely five stars and has become my favorite.","SAMSUNG 13.3” Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM,4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, Ultra Slim Design, Chrome OS, WiFi 6, Mercury Gray",&859
29,J. David Vaizer S.,"March 14, 2022",1.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing Chromebook at a cost,"First of all let's start with the design which is unbelievable. Being able to come up with such a powerful device so thin and light, just sets the bar on what is possible.Nevertheless it is still a Chromebook/Android tablet/2 in 1. Superfast on everything web-related, secure, beautiful screen and Android apps support make it ideal for most use cases if not a bit of an overkill.But if one needs tasks like video/photo editing, desktop Office apps etc, other solutions may be more suitable for the price.","SAMSUNG 13.3” Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM,4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, Ultra Slim Design, Chrome OS, WiFi 6, Mercury Gray",&859

33,joni steinkamp,"March 2, 2022",1.0 out of 5 stars,Opened it turned it on it updated and crashed,"The touchscreen is nice I liked that aspect a lot. The overall size and weight are great also, perfect for school and work. However I was only able to use my chrome book for 15-20 minutes before it crashed. I opened it got the Wi-Fi connected, got logged in to my gmail account and it automatically began a system update. When it was finished it would shut off 4-5 times then Return to the Lock Screen and prompt the password and repeat the same thing again. Saying google was not shut down properly but would continue to shut itself down then back to Lock Screen. I’m sending it back and will not order a replacement in fear of it doing the same thing.","SAMSUNG 13.3” Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM,4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, Ultra Slim Design, Chrome OS, WiFi 6, Mercury Gray",&859

I sent it the next day ($18 just to ship it), and they told me today that it was broken and they would have to send me a replacement. Fingers crossed that it goes well and they'll keep their word.The computer itself is very nice, but the software is buggy.

He said it was faulty so when I needed to return, they would fix then return to me. If problems continued they would send me a new one. That would take several weeks.  Fortunately the Amazon Rep was on the call the entire time, she offered me to return and they would send a new unit in 2 days. Obviously I went with that option instead. 2nd unit same exact problems but it took a little longer.
