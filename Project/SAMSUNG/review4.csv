3,kelly giottonini,"February 9, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excceptional, Practical, and Efficient Product. Impressive in all aspects-- thorough review",". Over the past year or two I came to realize that not only Chromebooks do almost everything a laptop or a PC or a tablet would do for me but they do it cheaper, usually faster and better, almost always worry-free and very much in style. I wrote 'almost' because, yes, not everything does everything even though the Chromebooks seem to be doing a lot and they are getting better - even run Microsoft Office these days (see note at the bottom).WHY A CHROMEBOOK AT ALL?There's so much to say here but let me make a quick summary. And never forget that we are talking about an 'around 300 dollars' device here because, yes, anything that costs 3-4-5 times as much should do SOMETHING better or very few of us would pay more for such devices.˕ My Chromebook is by far my most used computer excluding work hours and by 'computer' I mean PCs, laptops and tablets.˕ Malware, spyware, adware-free. Since nothing is really 'installed' on a Chromebook and not much is physically stored on it, it would be very hard for one to be infected. I am in fact now using my Chromebook to open suspicious emails or click on dubious URLs that I don't dare touch from a laptop.˕ Extremely safe OS. I don't know if this is common knowledge but Google is constantly challenging hackers to crack their OS. As far as I know, Chrome OS wasn't cracked yet.˕ Easy to share among any number of users without any concerns of compromising privacy. If you have a Google account, you simply sign in and you are going to be within your own, personal environment.˕ Constantly updated and upgraded. Google updates Chrome OS every few weeks and I found my Chromebooks actually getting better all the time rather than slowly fall into obsolescence.˕ Nearly maintenance free. Whenever I don't use a tablet or even a laptop for a while, they tend to get very busy once I turn them back on, downloading and installing various patches, updates and upgrades. Not the case for Chromebooks. Whatever upgrades may take place don't hit my Chromebook. Whenever I call up an app, I get it in its latest version.˕ The attached keyboard helps a lot. Yes, you can pair a keyboard and even a mouse to a tablet but the Chromebook's keyboard is always there, it negates the need of a stand or even some protecting case.˕ Chrome OS is streamlined and efficiently focused where it matters, on the everyday uses most of us need a 'computer' most of the time.˕ Chrome OS being such a streamlined one, browsing and running apps on a Chromebook is in fact faster than off a PC/laptop/tablet of equivalent specs.˕ Relatively low prince, 11.6"" display and light weight seem to be just about right for something that typically you'd be using to browse the Web while watching TV or take to and from school.WHY NOT A CHROMEBOOK?Yes, Chromebooks can't do everything. Google's productivity suites notwithstanding, Chromebooks are best at media consumption rather than production. Nobody should buy a Chromebook and expect to be able to edit video or do some hard-core gaming. There are other machines and devices for such tasks. My experience is that a Chromebook can't do 'everything'. Tablets are more portable, PCs and laptops are more powerful and versatile but, to me, my Chromebook is the most fun to use and it's likely to stay this way. I am not going to call it my 'second' or 'third' or 'first' computer but, objectively, it's the one I most use outside business hours if what we measure is 'hours'.MY SON's SAMSUNG's CHROMEBOOK 2 vs. MY HP's CHROMEBOOK 11From the start, it was a very familiar feeling. Samsung's is easily recognizable as a Chromebook (see video).This is how they compare:˕ USB-based charging. Yeah... it's proprietary on the Samsung vs. semi-proprietary on the HP. HP's USB-based charging allows the use of most off-the-shelf chargers so there's a lot less to worry. However, off-the-shelf chargers aren't as efficient as the HP-supplied one so, while I give HP's a slight advantage, both HP and Samsung's are better off when charged with the manufacturer-supplied charger.˕ Better quality display. When compared to Samsung's, HP's colors are sharper and brighter and you can view the screen from almost any angle left/right or up/down. This can be seen in the attached video but it's the difference is even sharper to notice with the naked eye.˕ Keyboard. As a touch typist I am comfortable with both but. On a blind test, I wasn't able to distinguish between the two. As the video shows, the size and the layout are very similar and so is the feel.˕ Style - see video. Again, a matter of preference. HP's glossy white is easier to wipe and clean but some may find Samsung's black more elegant. Both HPs and Samsungs come in other colors. They are both Okay as far as I can tell.˕ Ports. There are no USB 3.0 or HDMI ports on the HP's but you do find them on Samsung's. Speaking for myself, I never felt a need to output HDMI off my Chromebook, ever. I am occasionally using USB to plug in a mouse dongle or perhaps a speaker set. Regardless, USB 3.0 is nice to have.˕ Other hardware. Samsung's comes with double the RAM (4GB) and a much faster processor. This is a clear advantage, especially when running demanding apps such as spreadsheets.Overall, I am pleased with both. I am going to keep my relatively old (but oh so pretty) HP because its primary use is 'entertainment' as in Web browsing and playing media but my kid prefers Samsung because, as a college student, he can put the faster processor and the extra memory to good use.RATINGChromebook 2, while generally excellent, loses one star for the somewhat dull display and for breaking through the 300 dollar price barrier.I am not going to compare Samsung's Chromebook with the Pixel or some top of the line laptop. So, let me make a 'duh' statement: this Chromebook is not as good as devices that sell for 3 times or 4 times as much so anyone who doesn't mind paying more should pay more and get one of those. Even though... look at some reasons above for why one my prefer a Chromebook to a laptop or a tablet, regardless of price.Samsung's is at least as good and in some ways better than my now one year old, often used and much trusted HP Chromebook 11, even though I prefer HPs better display. As far as performance, Samsung beats HP when loading pages even though they both appear to be up to the task and they both played Netflix movies flawlessly over Wi-Fi and cast them to the big TV through Chromecast (no need of an HDMI cable for that) - I mention it because I just tried that. Samsung's Chromebook was able to easily and simultaneously play a movie on Netflix, a video on Youtube and a song on Pandora while I was checking my email and running a spreadsheet in the cloud without breaking a sweat. Not bad for such an inexpensive device. By the way, I had to cut that part from the attached video because it was too annoyingly noisy but I will try to redo it and attach it later.Chromebooks are not for everyone and they are not a universal computing device and Samsung's Chromebook 2 is a Chromebook through and through but, if used for what they are meant to be used, they are as good and as revolutionary as tablets._____________________________________________________NOTES:- Prior to ordering this Chromebook, I attended 'orientation' at our kid's college. The session with the IT director helped me decide to order it. I really wasn't sure what was good for him. He already has a rather large Windows 8 laptop but he doesn't want to take it to school because it's too large and heavy among other reasons. I asked the IT person if he was going to be Okay if he used a Chromebook and he said 'yes'. Then I asked the specific 'Microsoft apps' question: ""are there any 'Microsoft apps' that he may need and won't be able to run on his Chromebook?"" The IT person stated that all students are granted free Web access to Microsoft Office and that Chromebooks are fully supported.- Like most Chromebooks, this one too comes with a free 100GB in Google's cloud for two years. I didn't take advantage of that offer and I'm not going to go for this one, simply because I have no use of 'cloud' storage that goes beyond Gmail at this time.- While Chromebooks are immune to viruses and other forms of malware, you are as tracked and 'monetized' while on a Chromebook as you are when browsing from your laptop or tablet or phone. However, there are ways to disrupt and confuse the trackers and my two favorite extensions these days are Disconnect Search (or Disconnect.me) that makes it impossible for Google to log your search activities and DoNotTrackMe which does what the name implies. Worth trying.","Samsung Chromebook 2 11.6 Inch Laptop (Samsung Exynos, 4 GB, 16 GB SSD, Black)",&49
4,Jennifer Gladen,"August 12, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Weird Material,"Because Chromebooks are so new and not widely used, invariably a review of this item has to be a review about the Chromebook OS as well as the machine itself.  I'll start with the OS.I have been intrigued by Chromebooks for a while but have been hesitant to try one because of their limitations.  Recently I needed to replace my laptop, but did not feel like plunking down a lot of cash for a new one.  I have a desktop PC with Windows 7 in good condition for running any special software that I may occasionally need, so I figured that if I ran into things the Chromebook could not handle I could always go back to my desktop for that.  As it turns out, I find myself going back to my desktop very rarely.  There are two programs -- an accounting program and an image processing program -- that I need to run on the desktop, and both of these I would prefer to use on the desktop anyway for the larger monitor.  For everything else the Chromebook not only does it, but does it faster and with less hassle.  If I need to send an email, upload some photos, check the news, or make a quick edit to a document, I can complete the task on my Chromebook in the time it would take my PC just to startup and become functional.  It starts up so quickly that I don't even think about it -- it is basically like opening a book.  The OS, from the user's point of view, is completely an afterthought.  You just switch on the machine and start working.  And you don't have to mess with anti-virus or anything like that.  It is such a worry- and hassle-free device that I can't believe they aren't more popular.  For anyone who dislikes doing PC maintenance or finds Windows confusing, this is definitely the system to go for.  When I first read reviews of Chrome, some said that if you wanted to experience Chrome, just maximize the Chrome browser in your PC and that was basically what it was like.  Not true (at least in the current version).  There are a number of apps built into the system (handy stuff like a calculator) and more that you can add on (nearly all for free) from the app store.  There is also a file manager for managing external storage devices as well as files stored in the machine's own solid state drive.  It is all very intuitive and easy to use.  I glanced through the help menus one time just to learn some shortcuts and such, but it was hardly necessary.  Once you get connected to the internet you will be off and running.  The system is also ideal for users who are using cloud-based apps like Google docs, Evernote, etc.  If you are not already using cloud-based apps, using a Chromebook will likely get you hooked on them.  You always have access to your files wherever you are, and you don't have to worry about losing because your computer crashed or something.So clearly I am sold on the OS.  How about the machine?  I was also pleasantly surprised with the quality of the machine, especially for the price.  It is very thin and lightweight, perfect for carrying around.  It is something you can slip into a briefcase or bookbag and hardly know it is in there.  My previous laptops all look massive in comparison.  I have seen some negative comments about the stitched styling of the top -- personally I think the texture looks and feels nice, and the stitching is reasonably subtle and not cheap looking.  It is not brushed aluminum or whatever, but you are not paying for brushed aluminum (nor should you in my opinion).  This is a machine that looks good and simple, and absolutely gets the job done.  The keyboard is pretty solid, although I am used to deeper keys (more like an external keyboard), and I love the simpler layout that the Chrome OS makes possible.  Huge track pad and very responsive.  I am not enough of a techie to comment on the technical specs really, but I would say that 4 gb ram seems like more than enough to be running a lightweight OS like this.  As for speed, as I mentioned above, everything I have done on this is lightning fast, including video streaming (HD) etc.  The monitor is about average -- I have no complaints about it except that I agree with some other reviewers that the viewing angle is not great, but for personal use it works well and I have watched lots of videos on it and done lots of reading at generally think it is a solid monitor for the price.  Speakers are average / typical for a laptop.  I have not clocked the battery runtime but it is off the charts compared to any laptop I have ever owned.  I don't even think about the battery, just charge it in if I happen to be near the power cable (sometimes only every couple of days depending on usage).  If you are used to a Windows PC I am sure it will be better than the runtime you have now.In conclusion, this is the laptop I always wished was possible.  It is inexpensive, requires no maintenance or software, and it does nearly everything you want very quickly.  Even if you are buying it just to use on the go, you will likely find that it quickly becomes your primary machine, even if you do need to go back to your Windows machine from time to time for a special application.","Samsung Chromebook 2 11.6 Inch Laptop (Samsung Exynos, 4 GB, 16 GB SSD, Black)",&49
5,Mr. K,"December 11, 2015",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great option for a tablet/laptop with an amazing price,"I’ve been using the Samsung Chromebook 2 for a few days and am ready to give some impressions.  I have been following the development of Chrome OS for a while now.  A year ago I pre-ordered the ASUS Chromebox, realizing it would be a good, cheap way to get to try out the OS, plus would fulfill the need for a second desktop computer (I already had a spare 24 inch monitor sitting around).  The OS was quite usable a year ago, and has seem some growth since that time, with bug fixes and added features such as the ability to download movies from Google Play to watch offline, and support for Microsoft Office documents has been improved.  There is a good selection of apps that will run offline and all your Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides are stored locally as well as on Google Drive.  When online the browser can be set to respond to “OK Google,” just like on Android.  No matter what Chrome OS device you pick, study the Help file in detail so that you understand the OS’s quirks (like how to right click!).I like to buy locally if possible, so I checked out a couple of stores.  Just based on style the Samsung was the clear leader.  Locally the stores had the silver Intel CPU model, and I got to check it out fairly thoroughly and thought it would do what I wanted.  I went home to compare specs and read reviews, and that’s when I learned about the black model with 4GB of RAM and the Exynos processor here on Amazon.  My ASUS performs OK with 2 GB so I figured that a 4GB model would be a good choice, although I wasn’t sure how the ARM processor would affect performance.  Several professional reviews that I read complained that the Exynos was a bit laggy compared with the Intel processors, but they were really pushing it hard in their tests, which is exactly what I would expect a pro reviewer to do.  Based on reviews on Amazon by actual users, I decided the Exynos version would be OK, and I really liked the looks of the black model.I’ve tried to test every possible feature of the Chromebook 2 in the past few days.  No need to comment on the excellent keyboard and trackpad, as that has been well covered.  As far as speed, I think it is OK.  Not the fastest laptop by any means, but is adequate for light computing and document processing.  YouTube videos run just fine, and I have used Chrome Remote Desktop with good results.  Responsiveness for document processing is pretty good, with just an occasional keystroke lag.  Audio both ways seems to be fine on Google Hangouts.  One thing that isn’t addressed on the Samsung web site is the design of the headphone jack.  In fact, it is a four conductor connection that supports both microphone in and stereo audio out, so you can plug in an earbud/mic combo of the type used with mobile phones.  The Chromebook connects with our Chromecast just fine.I don’t have any issue with the screen and, in fact, I'm pretty well pleased with it..  It’s plenty contrasty for me, and you can dial it up to “torch mode” if you want.  A computer is useless if you can’t do I/O, so a good keyboard, trackpad, and screen go a long way toward keeping the user happy in my opinion.  If you keep the screen turned down the battery life goes up.  Speaking of battery life, of course it varies with what you’re doing and screen brightness, but it appears that eight hours is an honest number for average use.  UPDATE: After another week of use I'd say that seven hours of battery life is a good, real-world number.The HDMI connection works just fine, and I’ve tested it both directly to our television receiver and with an HDMI-to-VGA adapter to a projector.  By the way, the HDMI port powered the adapter just fine and didn’t require external power from a USB port.  I bought a Class 10, 32GB Sandisk microSD card from Amazon for about $15 and discovered two things I had not expected: The default download location can be pointed to the SD card, thus saving space on the SSD, and the Sandisk card comes with a full size adapter, so I could put it in the full-size slot on any of my other computers to transfer files if needed, or could actually use it in a camera if I wanted.  By the way, speaking of cameras Polarr appears to be a good, offline-capable app that emulates Lightroom and will process RAW files.One last thing, another reviewer suggested getting the AmazonBasics 11.6-Inch Laptop Sleeve to go with this Chromebook.  I did that and it is a snug but good fit.  You need to stretch it a bit when pulling the zipper over the corners, but it is a nice, padded case for the price.Overall, if I could give fractional stars, I'd rate the Samsung Chromebook 2 with Exynos processor about a 4.6.  It does what it is supposed to quite well and has an interface that is easy to live with.","Samsung Chromebook 2 11.6 Inch Laptop (Samsung Exynos, 4 GB, 16 GB SSD, Black)",&49
6,Lon J. Seidman,"June 21, 2014",4.0 out of 5 stars,Everything is excellent except the screen,"Love it! New chromebook user, soon to be college student, and love this samsung. I go to a school where 90% of the kids have macs, but I'm very happy with choosing this chromebook.  I was almost sold on getting a 2nd gen refurbished Macbook pro for around $600, but then chose this chromebook because my buddy told me about how pleased he is with his. Not only is this cheaper (about $380 after getting protection plan, which I would highly recommend because even though the laptop is well put together, it is very thin, light and has a plastic body which I could foresee breaking with a good drop) but I actually prefer this over having a ""real"" laptop. Aside from Aesthetics, which apple is the premium, I don't think it can get much better than this for your average tech using student. The small, compact, and light body is very convenient, and I have nothing to complain about in regards to the keyboard and touch pad which are all up to par. The only things I'd mention about the keyboard is that there is no Caps Lock key and I'm not sure if there is a way around it, but I also haven't really looked into it because it's not a huge concern of mine. Furthermore, the keys aren't lighted but I think this is pretty over rated because the screen provides lighting if you're in the dark.  I got the Black model and, again, nothing to complain about in terms of how it looks. The faux leather top isn't too flashy where it looks tacky, and I'm not overly crazy about it but it is different and looks nice in a subtle way. I wouldn't let this play too big of a factor if your'e thinking about getting this because if you aren't a fan of it I'm sure there are clip on cases to cover it. It's very thin and light which I like, but also doesn't feel overly plastic and cheap, but again it is far from the feel of a macbook body. The speakers are located on the bottom but deliver; I wasn't sure what to expect with the audio but the sound is clear and pretty loud coming from the speakers(louder and nicer than most laptops, mac included)  Now, what I think is most important when thinking about purchasing a laptop--the actual performance. This thing is FAST. My wifi at my house is pretty strong, but with xbox live running, a laptop, a desktop, and a handful of smartphones all using the same network, it definitely slows down and is disappointing at times. The laptop shared by my family is a couple years old, and a little dated, but is by no mean a bad machine and sometimes when browsing the internet or trying to load videos it is frustratingly slow, and my iphone has its stuttering moments, but with this samsung chromebook it has performed exceptionally on my home's wifi network. It hasn't taken more than a second or two for any webpage to load even with multiple tabs and spotify running in the background. Also I'm a big fan of google play store on the device because you now have so many apps and useful programs at your disposal. Google docs also offers all the average consumer needs in microsoft office, and it's for free. I haven't yet run into an incompatible program or website. The screen is also satisfactory. I have not used it yet outside on a bright sunny day, but it seems that the brightness (which is easily adjusted with keys on the board) gets bright enough so lighting isn't an issue. The resolution is very clear and suits all I need perfectly (clear enough for good res videos and regular use) but if you're expecting a premium, high def, top of the market picture you aren't gunna get it. The chromebook also runs silently--I haven't heard a fan kick in yet--, boots up super quick, and wakes up from sleep instantly and without any lag. The battery life is amazing. I opened it out of the box, hooked it up to the charger(long chord, generic with box thingy on chord), and it booted right up for me to easily sync my gmail account.  Overall; I HIGHLY RECOMMEND a chromebook. Whether it be this model or a different one, I truly believe these are the best options for your money on the market right now. I was scared that I wasn't going to be getting a ""full"" laptop, or miss out on features that a chromebook possibly couldn't offer, but I was wrong. For the average tech user/consumer/student I would recommend a chromebook 10 times out of 10 and this Samsung  is impressive on all levels!","Samsung Chromebook 2 11.6 Inch Laptop (Samsung Exynos, 4 GB, 16 GB SSD, Black)",&49

8,Arturo,"February 23, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,Had a few flaws but does the job,"This is a solid Chromebook.Pros:- Battery life is good, usually get 6-8 hours of use between charges- Size and weight, small but plenty big enough to browse the interwebs effectively. Also very light.- Simple user interfaceCons:- Biggest problem is with Chrome OS, crashes frequently. Not really sure what the problem is. I'm not doing anything other then surfing web or watching YouTube videos. Crashes at least 2-3 times during a nightly use session. Really frustrating.- Build quality, a few small drops and there are a few cracks in the frame around the screen and dents on the frame. I know these products aren't intended to be dropped but drops that happened weren't really hard and I was surprised the Chromeback has such damage. Not a huge problem, has not affected performace.- I have a lot of bookmarks and links saved in my Chrome. Sometimes it is slow to open up my bookmarks. Also sometimes browsing the other apps in the Chromebook can be slow. Also loading webpages is sometimes slow but that is more to do with the internet speed.- Some times laggy when surfing or using apps. Could use a bit more RAM to be more effective but you get what you pay for.Overall:I really love this Chromebook and will be buying the 3rd version. For the few problems I've had it has been an absolute pleasure to own. It's small size is great for travelling and still being able to take your laptop with you. It can do what you need for word process, excel type documents and PDF's. It's a really useful item if you don't want a tablet. There are a lot of more expensive competitors especially with the introduction of the tablet/laptops like the Surface Pro 4 and Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro but those are full blown operating systems and are priced starting at $1000 bucks. This Chromebook costing so little and still being able to compete is a no brainer for me. I highly recommend it to everyone whose looking for a new laptop or tablet.Come on Samsung bring out the Chromebook 3 already I'm ready to upgrade.","Samsung Chromebook 2 11.6 Inch Laptop (Samsung Exynos, 4 GB, 16 GB SSD, Black)",&49

10,Amazon Customer,"January 21, 2015",3.0 out of 5 stars,This particular model is ho-hum.,"I love and hate this particular Chromebook.  I enjoyed not having to buy an anti-virus program for this OS, as it is installed into the browser.  I also enjoyed using Google's proprietary apps which I found to be better than Microsoft's original versions, and anything I normally do on the internet worked just fine here.  I was unhappy with all the online apps offered in the Chrome Store.  Many are subpar at best.  I also understood at the time I purchased the unit that Chrome Store would be offering more apps that were already available on the Android platform but to date, there's only a handful.  Even with the Android platform coming to Chromebook, this particular model is not getting the update due to it being a non-Intel model.  This Chromebook constantly disconnects from Bluetooth and Wifi.____________________________________________________________________________(old review)I recently got rid of my Windows laptop and decided to try a Chromebook.  My PC habits have changed over the years and with all the applications now available via the cloud, I thought the Chromebook would be a nice, affordable change.  I've been working with Google apps for quite a while on my other PC and tablet and thought I'd give the cloud world a 100% green light.  I've been working with it for 2 months and I'm liking it so far.This particular Chromebook 2 by Samsung is very nice.  I do feel like I have a sturdy product in hand.  I love the fact that when I open it up, it automatically turns on and I can log into my work space in seconds.  I gave this product 4 out of 5 stars because the typing keys already look slightly worn with only 2 months of use, and I'm only on it about an hour a day and not even typing much at that.  However, I have no reason to believe the keys will short out or give up before the life of the product itself.","Samsung Chromebook 2 11.6 Inch Laptop (Samsung Exynos, 4 GB, 16 GB SSD, Black)",&49

12,BerkeleyBear,"April 7, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,I love chromebooks now and wish I could give one to everyone I know lol,"I wouldn't even know where to begin with how much I love this chromebook. After several charges, I now get about 5-6 hours of battery life until I need to charge it again. Though, I do recall having up to 8 hours of battery life in the beginning. Going from a heavy/huge laptop (Toshiba Satellite) to this one felt amazing. I love google products and the switch to solely using google drive was natural. Now there is microsoft versions of word, excel, powerpoint, etc. that you can use if you do not like google docs, spreadsheet and slides. I love how light it is, the size is perfect for me as a student since it is not too tiny nor too big for college desks, and the speed in turning on and off. The ONE downside I have with this since I love just about everything about it is that I have issues with printing. You should check to see if your printer is ""cloud-ready"" because if it isn't then you need to use another computer in order to do the cloud printing. Basically what this means is that I find the file on the chromebook, do the print set up and press print, then go to my old laptop and open it up and log in. As soon as you wake up the laptop that has the cloud-ready printing on it, the printer will begin to print. It is not too much of a hassle but I am thinking of just selling my old laptop and this printer (even though it is relatively new) and just buying a cloud-ready printer. I had also bought a tablet not long after (Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 7.0) getting this but ended up selling it because I really had no use for it (I bought it for school but thought this was much more handy so it ended up being just for games). Any of your considering getting a tablet, just get this and try it because it is awesome and is much more practical than a tablet. You won't have to buy extra accessories aside from maybe a case and or screen protector since it already has everything you need.","Samsung Chromebook 2 11.6 Inch Laptop (Samsung Exynos, 4 GB, 16 GB SSD, Black)",&49
13,JayKruz_90,"November 9, 2014",4.0 out of 5 stars,I could have easily gotten a refund after I found this out but ...,"I bought this computer because I had to put my macbook pro in the shop for a fan replacement and I attend a school where we use our computers everyday. I wanted something that I could use temporally and at a decent price. First off this computer doesn't work for my school because two programs that we use for class does not run on chrome. I could have easily gotten a refund after I found this out but I fell in love with this computer the minute I took it out of the box.First, I love the size of this computer it's very lightweight and the screen is perfect, even though it is an 11 inch its not too small. All you need is a wifi connection and you're good to go, you can save documents, transfer your music and videos, etc. I'm keeping this computer because it's easier to carry around then my 15 inch macbook pro. I can just sit it on my lap and tap away. My only complaint is that this computer is not compatible with software that isn't made by google, I get that this is why it is called chrome book. I understand not running the same programs as apple or micro soft but programs used by schools should be able to run on a chrome book, if they were a lot more people would have them.So if you're thinking about getting this for school but your school use programs like Repondus or Graph Pad or anything similar, then this can't be your main computer, its good for a backup or recreational use.

14,irisch,"August 19, 2014",3.0 out of 5 stars,Looks and feel good but not so sure about performance.,"I don't write many reviews but I felt I should write one on this Chromebook 2.First, let me say I am not new to the Chromebook. I purchased one back in 2012 it was a Samsung and at the time it first came out I forked out $450.00 for it but my wife loved it and used it everyday since the day I bought it. Well, she got her new one yesterday and it took me less then 5 minutes to set it up.Now the look and feel of the new one is much better then the old Chromebook, not saying the old one was that bad. That was the plus side now for the performance. My wife like to watch one soap opera, which she watches everyday. On her old Chromebook it ran great, but on the new one it would pause, skip, and jerk. Now the new unit has 2 gig more memory and a better processor so I didn't expect this.Well, I went on the help forum for the Google Chrome and tried a few things, like turning off extensions and logging on as guest, it helped some but it still runs slower then the old one.My wife is going to give it a couple of days and decide if she wants to send it back. This is why I am only giving it three stars.I also have to be honest with you the soap she watches is on ABC and they don't do videos very well. I try videos from youtube and they work much better. I just feel the overall performance is not as good as the older Chromebook. By the way you can find the old one much cheaper. I missed out on buying one a deal of the day for $85.How this review will help with your decision making.","Samsung Chromebook 2 11.6 Inch Laptop (Samsung Exynos, 4 GB, 16 GB SSD, Black)",&49
15,Late Adopter,"May 15, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far so, so good! Fast, simple, polished.","Just came, today. Very easy to set up (including getting Hebrew to work, which I need). Very fast to both boot up and come out of sleep. I'm used to using Macbooks and this is obviously not quite as versatile and polished, but it's actually kind of close in the physical experience -- ie, the keyboard and the touchpad are comparable (and that's high praise for a machine that's maybe a third of the price).Just starting to try the offline capacity, but Google Docs -- the main software I use -- seems to work well offline. Streams Netflix and Hulu well.Starting to notice some things it _can't_ do. The pdf reading capacity is nothing close to what you get with Mac's Preview -- no ability to annotate or edit pdfs (maybe someone will come out with a good app for that like iAnnotate on the iPad). In a more 'critical mission' department, some banking/utility company software doesn't work with the Chrome browser . . . . and with a _Chromebook_, you can't just switch to MS Explorer or Safari or something to see if it works better.Bottom line, it seems like an extraordinary machine for the price, especially if you have (like me) already moved just about everything you do into the cloud (only maybe 8gig of usable hard disk space here).  . . . With the small storage space and the limited software options it feels to me a little bit like something in between a tablet and a full-service computer. But, as with tablets, you seem to get something in return for sacrificing some functionality -- lightening fast performance at what it does do, especially in terms of being almost instantly available from sleep.Great option if you don't need a ton of hard disk space for videos and such and you're not trying to do image editing or desktop publishing.","Samsung Chromebook 2 11.6 Inch Laptop (Samsung Exynos, 4 GB, 16 GB SSD, Black)",&49
16,Jason,"July 14, 2014",3.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed / annoyed,"I was really excited for this chromebook after using my wife's acer base model for a few weeks, however, I have been pretty disappointed.  First issue: uploading photos from an external hard drive.  Google drive and/or this computer can't handle my 8GB upload of photos, and it keeps crashing or simply cutting the upload off around 2000 files.  Next, the file manager is poor.  I can't delete files from my external HD via the file manager, and I also am unable to see summary statistics for any folder in my google drive (total space, file count, etc.).Next: display issues.  I've hooked up my computer to the TV and it can't mirror screens.  On top of that, the HDMI connection is fragile and crashes chrome browser sometimes or loses the mouse.Next: screenshot problems.  About 50% of the time, my screenshots fail and I have to redo them.Next: media playback.  the standalone video player wouldn't read the video portion of my mkv file.  i'm sure it's a codec issue, but annoying nonetheless.I was swayed by some of the reviews for this product that insisted, yes, even though this is mostly a cloud machine, it is just as good as a real computer.  I see where they're coming from.  If these things worked, I'd be inclined to agree, but as it stands, this is a far inferior product to what I was expecting, and inferior even to the Acer $200 model my wife has, even with the extra computing power.  I wish I had purchased that one and pocketed the extra $100.Be warned.","Samsung Chromebook 2 11.6 Inch Laptop (Samsung Exynos, 4 GB, 16 GB SSD, Black)",&49
17,Kelly,"July 16, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,It is great for what it is advertised for - internet,"This is growing on me.  It is great for what it is advertised for - internet, email, basic surfing.  It supports my candy crush addiction.  It boots up quickly and has great battery life.  Keyboard is a great size. It doesn't get super hot and it has already survived a few drops from a 2-3 foot high table onto carpeted floor that sits next to my recliner.  That being said, it supports a limited number of video codecs so if you want to watch videos on it offline there is a good chance it won't play.  You can do a side boot to ubuntu through the crouton? ""app"" but since this is an ARM based machine, options are limited in Ubuntu.  I could not get flash working in Ubuntu and my videos wouldn't play there either.  I'm not really sold on the fake leather external casing but that isn't really a deal breaker either.  If I had done my research prior to my impulse buy I would have known about the limitations and probably wouldn't have bought it.  I would, however, recommend this for parents or siblings or those who aren't technologically savvy.  This would be great for my parents who used to turn the computer off by flipping the power switch because they would forget how to do it through a windows start ""bar:.  It would also be great for people who ""click on every link"" and download malware with every link they open.

18,Steven Williams,"June 21, 2015",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Missing too many features to be a good laptop or internet device, get an Asus or an iPad","I just wanted a cheap laptop, so I thought I'd give ChromeOS a chance.  After using it for a year I wish I'd spent the extra 100$ for a refurbished Macbook or an Asus instead.  Every month or so I try to accomplish some seemingly common task, only to find that there is no way to do it on ChromeOS.  When you count in the amount of time spent trying to find workarounds (if they even exist) the price tag on this ""bargain"" laptop increases pretty rapidly.  I am a highly technical person, so this list is not compiled in ignorance.  Overall feels like Google just wanted you to do things The Google Way.  Linux, Windows, and Mac all have much bigger developer communities so pretty much any task you want to accomplish is possible, not so with ChromeOS.  If you really just want an internet machine get an iPad, better battery life and apps that don't suck.Tasks that suck  SSH.  You can use the developer shell, but it is a pain to use private key files, set up tunnels, or anything else that one would expect. Also with a tiny resolution your window is limited to being 100 characters wide or so, even on a massive external display.  Torrents. JSTorrent sorta works, but its frustrating and slow.  Downloaded Files.  Google doesn't like offline files, cause they can't monetize your usage of them.  Any downloaded file can randomly be deleted.  Netflix is slow, sometimes audio is distorted. Also limited to 720p output.  Granted, Chrome on ANY platform is limited to 720p, but even Internet Explorer can do 1080p.  Flash is broken.  Not that common anymore but still frustrating.Features Missing (ZERO workarounds)  Cannot zoom/pan images downloaded from the internet.  Good luck if your vacation photos are larger than the tiny screen.  When connected to external display, turning off said monitor puts it to sleep.  KeepAwake doesn't work, despite what people say.  Tried to use my chromebook to browse the internet on my TV from the couch with a wireless keyboard, but turning off the TV would turn off the chromebook.  No way to SCP files to/from remote server  Hangouts doesn't work properly, sound is distorted, video is unusable even on high-speed connection.","Samsung Chromebook 2 11.6 Inch Laptop (Samsung Exynos, 4 GB, 16 GB SSD, Black)",&49

The screen is beautiful, the keyboard feels perfect, you don't have to be online all the time, or half the time, or ever.  Plenty of offline apps with their own section in the app store, and Android apps are coming very soon in a Chrome OS update.  Docs and Sheets work great on my phone and tablet and they work 100 times better on my Chromebook.  Perfectly capable office suite.  My sister is a teacher whose large school furnished each student with a Chromebook, and after a few months of having them they ordered one for each teacher to phase out the teachers Mac desktops that were used for grading and such.  Google nailed it and is continuing to make it better, Samsung's input is flawless, the build is solid, fake leather feels nice, and who the hell cares about the fake stitching I think it looks great but if that deters you I'd rather know that you don't have one of these so you don't hurt yourself beating it against your head to try and open it.

This is is just a ipad or galaxy s4 touch with a keyboard but with much less available apps because its chrome os.Simple things like printing and saving are nightmares. No cd drive so you have to try to install programs online..not gonna happen because you can only download window, mac, linux. So how do you get the programs on to your chromebook. YOU DON'T!!!After a 3 hour session of google-ing and trying to find a solution. All there is to do is some coding..sorry I didn't study coding so I can't write code. Shame on me, right?... This is an extremely frustrating device. Spend the extra hundred on an actual PC or go big and spend 700-1200 on an apple product. Seriously this product has leaps and bounds to go before it can be considered par with PCs. Avoid this thing...unless you need to use email or internet.If you want to skype, Line, use quicktime for videos or other common programs this is not the ""computer"" for you. You simply can't install the majority of them.Do yourself a favor. Go on Youtube, search things like ""install skype on google chromebook"". Watch the video and see what kind of process you'll have to go through to install something as simple and common as skype. Coding and other thing most ""common folk"" like me don't know how to do...Nightmare. I wish I would have done some homework before. Now I'm stuck with a computer that has much less available programs than android, apple and linux.At 320 bucks this is a rip off, its Junk avoid.

Everything is great about this machine which i'm writing this review on, however the seal for the device did come broken. I know it says dont accept if the seal is broken however i opened it and nothing was out of place. The device is a great performer, and the octa core really gives it that extra power to do a great job. Screen is pretty good in terms of quality. Great for my online summer school and chrome is a very robust browser for anything on the web. Literally boots in about 5-10 secs and logs in easily. WiFi chip is excellent and battery life is amazing. Charges extremely fast however it also lasts a long time. Really takes a good media beating without killing the battery too much. It was also great to go to the samsung booth and pull out a product they still have yet to release in stores for months. Also design kills all Chromebooks below it except for the 13 inch chromebook 2. I wish the webcam was better though.

It is super light, the front cover feels very nice making the laptop very attractive. The display quality is great for a 360$ laptop and the keyboard does not feel cheap at all. The keys are very responsive yet the frame its self does not bounce back like cheap plastic usually does. Overall great buy, Im planning on using this computer for college because I will not need a lot of computer power, just something that can get the essays and presentations done.Just a tip, you might wanna buy the ethernet to usb3.0 converter, this way you can get internet if there isnt wifi in the building. (this chromebook comes with one usb 3.0 port)","Samsung Chromebook 2 11.6 Inch Laptop (Samsung Exynos, 4 GB, 16 GB SSD, Black)",&49
43,paul d.,"November 8, 2014",4.0 out of 5 stars,Fairs fair.,"Very happy with the purchase of this little computer, lives up to my expectations, which is to say I can email and pay my bills, do my banking and listen to the radio on line.  Screen quality could be a little better but the price is reasonable enough, I would not begrudge paying a little more for a better quality screen or if it meant Amazon paying it's workers a little more money and treating them with a little more dignity and respect.","Samsung Chromebook 2 11.6 Inch Laptop (Samsung Exynos, 4 GB, 16 GB SSD, Black)",&49
44,Homemaker,"October 3, 2014",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good chromebook, poor display","I bought this unit a few weeks ago. Light, fast starting, it does everything I need to do, mainly to update my profile, something a few web sites do not allow me to do via mobile devices, and cut my cord from windows. Definitely my travel pc so I don't have to use a public pc.If you intend to watch videos, stay away from this book, because the display is mediocre. Remind me of the old TFT days when I had to tilt the panel or adjust my position to get a passable view of the screen. It's so 80's.3 stars for the book, 0 for display.","Samsung Chromebook 2 11.6 Inch Laptop (Samsung Exynos, 4 GB, 16 GB SSD, Black)",&49
45,Cortney,"June 25, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,"A solid, high end (albeit expensive) Chromebook","I have owned SEVERAL Chromebooks since inception of the OS, (I have mentioned them below for a comparison).As far as the complete package goes, (Battery life, screen, processing speed and construction) this unit takes the prize.In my opinion, better than:Hp Chromebook 11Hp Chromebook 14 (2nd generation)Toshiba Chromebook 13.3Samsung Chromebook 11.6 (1st generation)Acer C710Acer C720Hp Chromebook 14 (1st generation)Asus C200 11.6Easily the best in the bunch, even among the larger screen models. The fact that Samsung adds free Apps that usually cost a bundle is value added!Samsung has set the bar higher and others should take notice that this is the model to get...Certainly worth the price of admission!","Samsung Chromebook 2 11.6 Inch Laptop (Samsung Exynos, 4 GB, 16 GB SSD, Black)",&49

I also specifically asked the seller does it still update, he lied and said it did. It does not. I'm using this while I fix my Mac but I won't be using this seller again.","Samsung Chromebook 2 11.6 Inch Laptop (Samsung Exynos, 4 GB, 16 GB SSD, Black)",&49
47,Steve Graham,"November 6, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice PC. My wife and I decided to try ...,"Very nice PC.  My wife and I decided to try this out after seeing one our daughter was using.  For lightweight Internet browsing and battery longevity its a dream.  Very lightweight as well.  The presentation quality is very high on both how it looks, and how good the screen is.My wife and I both have alternative machines we do our work on.  But for casual browsing on Facebook or the internet, this is a superior PC and much easier to deal with.  We can take it to the living room for hours without having to drag the power adapter out.  And it is a pleasure to use.","Samsung Chromebook 2 11.6 Inch Laptop (Samsung Exynos, 4 GB, 16 GB SSD, Black)",&49
48,Pali Aha,"December 23, 2014",3.0 out of 5 stars,Do I Know What I'm Talking About?,"I don't know if this is a fair review.  My biggest impetus on buying an Apple Mac Air last week was that I was too limited w/the Chromebook.  If you want a keyboard and all you do is typing online, the Chrome works.  But i need to do light photo editing and the Chrome barely could handle it (sometimes, never at all).  Personally I think the Chromebook is supplanted by iPads and similar devices.  I really can't see what niche the Chromebook would fit.  Again, this might not be fair.Looks great!","Samsung Chromebook 2 11.6 Inch Laptop (Samsung Exynos, 4 GB, 16 GB SSD, Black)",&49
49,Charles A. Williams,"June 27, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,One of the best products I have ever purchased,"One of the best products I have ever purchased. I love my Chromebook. Light, portable, reliable, inexpensive and probably a few more. I did manage to ruin the screen by putting too much pressure on the screen while moving it. However i order a replacement screen on amazon and it works fine. This is my go to device when I'm on the move, other than my smart phone. Also work nicely with google chrome-cast. There i a little distortion in the touch pad when the device is flexed. Would definitely purchase again.","Samsung Chromebook 2 11.6 Inch Laptop (Samsung Exynos, 4 GB, 16 GB SSD, Black)",&49
