1,E. Delgado,"May 4, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this Chromebook, but not touchscreen!","I love it’s small compact size that travels with me easily. I was able to hook up both a Bluetooth mouse and ear buds at the same time without using a USB port. Easy to use and FAST! I’m not very tech savvy and I have not had a problem that I couldn’t easily google a way to know how to do it! I have seen complaints about screen view angle, as I am sitting with it on my lap/ table, this is not a huge issue for me. With the correct angle the screen has a nice view for watching you tube/ other. I had a Google Meets meeting yesterday, and saw everyone just fine! I would buy again, but if I could afford it, I would get a touchscreen.","Samsung Chromebook 4 Chrome OS 11.6"" HD Intel Celeron Processor N4000 6GB RAM 64GB eMMC Gigabit Wi-Fi - XE310XBA-K03US",&279
2,Alia Rose ,"April 11, 2021",1.0 out of 5 stars,Seemed worth the money but major hidden costs,"Fourth Update:A brief moment of connectivity assured me: ""You're connected to a Ethernet network."" Not just getting norked out of your two hundred smackers and your valuable time. Right? Not just serving to provide a connection to someone who lacks a valid visa, Right? Now's the time to dish the real dirt on the first purchase: it burned my legs, there was some bad circuitry or programming. This device is labeled as made in VietNam but I wouldn't be sure it's even that good. The price is cheap and the build is like from Mattel but this is no toy. Buyer Beware!!!The replacement seemed new enough & didn't burn my legs or fingers but I had to return it. Along with the bargain chromebook came some dedicated representatives of the seller/manufacturer...? Who set up camp across the creek from my cabin & have been diggling with the connections for weeks. Its been a total hassle. Still I wanted to avoid the bother of returning a $200 dollar purchase & tried & tried to make it work but just like the first purchased (killswitched) there has been an administrative kaibosh on internet access at the last day to return the thing. I was one hundred percent connected yet denied internet access (see screenshot) & had to use my older chromebook to set up the return.Updates: (third review)The replacement netbook from Samsung. Could Amazon be the unwitting host of a seller of stolen or even counterfeit goods? More and more programming irregularities keep  showing up. Like the pic I'm posting now: Prompted to use Guest Mode and/or Sign In when I already AM in Guest Mode...Still I really wanted to love the netbook but closer inspection showed more and more signs of excessive factory-programmed presets and physical scuff marks, even dings in the cover that evidenced this was a used chromebook. I would still give it four stars for the moments it did work, at one point my one-bar cell connection ran an hour-long documentary on Prime Video with virtually no interruptions, BUT once I attempted to use the logged-in owner account and install ZOOM and Bitdefender the thing just DIED!!! It won't charge, it won't turn on, NOTHING!!!Thank God I'm within the 30-day return period and bought the Assurion plan, but how disappointing to have to return it, it looks like if this sort of problem continues I might be profiled as a difficult customer.The main reason I selected this 6GB RAM Samsung Chromebook: the USB charging function, and for this I'd give it ten stars if possible.Drawbacks: The hi-speed charger that came with the unit just about overheated & I had to purchase the 45w adapter and a couple C-to-USB adapters separately, but my dream of keeping my off-grid connection charged from my rinkydink solar setup has now come true!Bonus Tips from a Non-techie: I'm not a techie here so I'm just wondering if the compatability between my Samsung phone and chromebook has boosted the connectivity through the use of tethering plus bluetooth. Whether it's the faster processor or whatnot, what took hours to load a 3-minute video before now loads instantly and this has saved me the time and expense of buying a signal booster.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K8G7663/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08QMSZR2C/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1","Samsung Chromebook 4 Chrome OS 11.6"" HD Intel Celeron Processor N4000 6GB RAM 64GB eMMC Gigabit Wi-Fi - XE310XBA-K03US",&279

4,Joyful56,"January 4, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Chromebook - Strongly Recommend,"I am really pleased with this machine. Chrome books are remarkably easy to set up and this was no exception. The size is very good for me - I use it at home, perched on my kitchen island. It is very lightweight and easy to use. I have had Chromebooks in the past that could never connect to my network printer (I had to print through my Windows computer.) But I was tickled to see this Chromebook connect immediately to my printer. I may finally be able to give up my Windows computer once and for all. Highly recommend.","Samsung Chromebook 4 Chrome OS 11.6"" HD Intel Celeron Processor N4000 6GB RAM 64GB eMMC Gigabit Wi-Fi - XE310XBA-K03US",&279
5,Azura,"April 1, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing,"I've used Chromebooks for years and have tried many brands. Samsung is the best, hands down.Some of my favorite features are long battery life, fast charging, no fan (it doesn't get super hot), ease of use, and simplicity. You can log on to a new one with your Gmail credentials and voila, you're up and running, just as before.This new version offers some great improvements.- Better performance. No lag during Zoom calls if you're on a decent connection, for example.- Type C charger you can share with other devices like Android smartphones- More solid shell and materials overallThe camera has not improved and I think my old one has a tiny advantage here. My Zoom setup looks brighter on my previous Chromebook for example.Overall, I love this Chromebook. I have a full laptop with a Linux build to do things that aren't suited for Chromebook but this is an excellent, lightweight solution for most of what I do for work.  High recommend.","Samsung Chromebook 4 Chrome OS 11.6"" HD Intel Celeron Processor N4000 6GB RAM 64GB eMMC Gigabit Wi-Fi - XE310XBA-K03US",&279
6,K. Samuel,"June 27, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Chromebook for the less discerning,"I needed a new Chromebook, but I specifically did not want the convertible kind with a touchscreen, and I did not want to pay more for features I actively did not want.  I also wanted one with an 11"" screen that had more memory and ram than the cheapest models.  This was pretty much the only Chromebook that fit those criteria.  I saw that most everyone liked it except for the screen, and I figured I had low enough demands for screen performance that it was worth a try.  I got a great deal on the 6/64 version, and I love it.  It's fast, lightweight, good keyboard, and the screen is fine for my philistine level of pixel appreciation.  If you like to watch movies etc. on your Chromebook I'd suggest taking into account the warnings from the other fine reviewers here, but if you just want to read, write, browse, and watch YouTube videos, you'll probably be satisfied.","Samsung Chromebook 4 Chrome OS 11.6"" HD Intel Celeron Processor N4000 6GB RAM 64GB eMMC Gigabit Wi-Fi - XE310XBA-K03US",&279

8,Scott Parkinson,"June 28, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Packing process needs to be more thorough.,"Everything was delivered as advertised. The Chromebook works perfectly. However, the packaging left a lot to be desired. The compartment of the shipping box where the Chromebook was had a lot of extra space and the Chromebook slid around whenever the box was moved. There was no padding to protect the Chromebook during shipping. So many things could have damaged it while it was in transit. Fortunately, we got lucky and it arrived intact.","Samsung Chromebook 4 Chrome OS 11.6"" HD Intel Celeron Processor N4000 6GB RAM 64GB eMMC Gigabit Wi-Fi - XE310XBA-K03US",&279

10,Cee Chance,"March 7, 2022",1.0 out of 5 stars,Chromebooks are the worst!,"I bought this laptop for my daughter (9 yrs old) to be her first laptop computer. I was looking for something that was somewhat easy to use and this chromebook popped up on a number of ""best first time laptops for kids"" lists. We've used it maybe a total of 3 times and it was a complete waste of money.First, the chromebook does not have the capabilities my daughter was looking for. This is our fault for not doing a little bit more research before buying (but this was more due to a miscommunication between parent and daughter). Unfortunately, this was a Christmas gift and my husband accidentally burned the box it came in on Christmas morning! So returning it wasn't an option. So we tried to make the best of it!The second issue is that the login and parent control features are too much. Every time my daughter tried to turn on the computer, we had to go through a lengthy process of entering a password, parent access code, password again, and sometimes we were then asked to enter all the parent email account information! It was totally ridiculous! And we even tried to adjust the settings to allow easier login but it seemed very arbitrary when we were or were not required to go through extra security levels to login.I'm not really sure why anyone would want to purchase a chromebook. They are junk. Limited capabilities (might as well buy a tablet) and everything is google dependent (not surprising but comes with too many limitations). I regret trying to buy a more affordable laptop for my kid.","Samsung Chromebook 4 Chrome OS 11.6"" HD Intel Celeron Processor N4000 6GB RAM 64GB eMMC Gigabit Wi-Fi - XE310XBA-K03US",&279

13,Cheryl Ann,"March 30, 2022",1.0 out of 5 stars,This Chromebook was 2.5 times more than the one I bought at Walmart and is even worse,"My first recommendation, is never buy a Chromebook. They are just terrible devices. First of all, the screen quality is horrible. You can't watch videos or movies, because it is terrible. You cannot brighten the screen, think of looking at a dingy gray screen that has no contrast. Between the two I bought and my friend's Chromebook, all from different manufacturers, it is clear that all Chromebooks have this problem. They don't have delete keys on the keyboard, and when I hook up an external keyboard, the enter, backspace, and several other keys do not work without pressing down the Shift key. The way your hand rests on the square hand control of the keyboard makes the curser jump around on you and do all sorts of things you don't want. So you cannot really use the device keyboard, you have to install and exterior one to do any real work. The devices are also very slow, which defeats the purpose. 6 GB Ram should be a lot faster. I had two ASUS notebooks a decade ago that were better in every regard. It is hard to navigate, hard to find what you need, really cannot use it for the word docs and other things. I really cannot think of one good thing about this Chromebook. This is NOT a touch screen device either, so know that upfront.","Samsung Chromebook 4 Chrome OS 11.6"" HD Intel Celeron Processor N4000 6GB RAM 64GB eMMC Gigabit Wi-Fi - XE310XBA-K03US",&279

I chose wisely!,"Samsung Chromebook 4 Chrome OS 11.6"" HD Intel Celeron Processor N4000 6GB RAM 64GB eMMC Gigabit Wi-Fi - XE310XBA-K03US",&279
43,Dester,"February 14, 2020",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great, light machine in its price range","Although the screen is nothing to write home about, the machine is well-built, has a sturdy feel, and is very lightweight. With 6GB of RAM everything works quickly and smoothly, and you could have more than a dozen tabs open without a slowdown. The machine will also get automatic security OS updates from Google until June of 2026. Overall, I would highly recommend this Chromebook.","Samsung Chromebook 4 Chrome OS 11.6"" HD Intel Celeron Processor N4000 6GB RAM 64GB eMMC Gigabit Wi-Fi - XE310XBA-K03US",&279

45,Karis Pechta,"July 7, 2021",2.0 out of 5 stars,"THIS DOES NOT support a stylus, as in the description when I purchased it","It seems the description may have been updated, but when I contacted support, they directed me to buy a stylus (based on, apparently, their own reading of the description).  Of course it didn't work. This doesn't support a stylus, as I found out when I contacted support again to ask what I could possibly be doing wrong.  And, of course, I can't return it - I opened it, logged in, set it up.  Worst Amazon service ever.  I gave it 3 stars as it seems it does what it's supposed to now that the description has been updated.","Samsung Chromebook 4 Chrome OS 11.6"" HD Intel Celeron Processor N4000 6GB RAM 64GB eMMC Gigabit Wi-Fi - XE310XBA-K03US",&279
