1,Michael A.,"October 17, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,An okay budget chromebook.,This is a nice low cost chromebook. I think that that screen is fine considering it's low cost. It does not have keyboard backlighting which can be found on some hp models at around the same price. I picked it up as a cheap complement to my galaxy book go. It's basically just okay.

I read the comments on poor screen quality and throught the buyers were just picky.  Well I'm not a picky person and don't like returning items.

12,Johnny_Amazon®,"September 28, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for Students, But Also Great for Adults, Especially for Travel","Since I'm not a student (Chromebooks are usually geared towards students), this review is mainly from a regular adult's point of view. Here is my reasoning for the title of my review - Chromebooks are perfect for travel because:1) Mainly because they are cheap, so in the event that you lose it or break it, you won't regret it so much.2) It is very light, especially for being a 14-inch laptop. At just over three pounds, it's beneficial for your carry-on luggage so you can save more leftover weight for your other essentials.3) The main difference between Chromebooks and regular laptops is that you can't install programs in the traditional sense. You have to use apps or extensions from Chrome. However, in this sense, the bright side is twofold: It allows for your computer to be more safe since you don't install programs onto it, and also it allows your laptop to perform faster since it's more streamlined in its purpose, which is a web-based/cloud-based laptop.4) A big 14-inch screen at this price is awesome. The bezels could have been thinner, especially at the top edge, but overall the screen is a plus considering the price. The battery life is also tremendous - I used it for a total of over six hours of surfing the web, watching movies, checking my emails, and it still had over 30% left. This is much better than my main laptop, which is an OLED 13"" HP Spectre x360.With this particular Chromebook from Samsung, I feel it is especially more faster than other Chromebooks I've used in the past. However, full disclosure, the last time I used a Chromebook was four years ago, so technology surely has since improved. There has been no lag for me so far when I'm using Chrome with a bunch of tabs open, including a few just for Gmail. I have also watched movies on Netflix.com, and it can handle all that running at once.With that out of the way, here are a few niggles that I was disappointed by. First and foremost is the screen, which is decent and expected of cheap laptops at this price range. Nonetheless, it's disappointing since it's Samsung, and I had expected better, since I have and have used so many Samsung products in the past it has made me jaded. It is not very bright, not made for outdoor use, with very limited viewing angles. The screen being at 14 inches was definitely a plus. especially since the whole la[top weighs just over three pounds, but I just wish it was better quality. And finally, the specs on this is a measly 4gb of RAM and only 32gb of flash memory drive. It would have been nice if they had an upgrade option of a better screen and specs for like $100 more.Taking everything into consideration, I still enthusiastically recommend this laptop. It's something you can buy just for a trip, and then back at home have as a secondary laptop that you rarely would use, and it would still not be a wasted buy. That's because with the overall package of everything put together, it's a great value: Big screen, great battery life, super lightweight, snappy performance, all at a great price of under $300.","Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Go Laptop Computer Lightweight Slim Durable Design 12-Hour Battery Wi-Fi 6 Share Files with Phone, Black,Silver,32GB",&289
13,Daniel M. Stoff,"July 18, 2022",1.0 out of 5 stars,Sim card Failure,"Got my Chromebook via AT&T 9 months ago.Everything worked great on it until an update from Google Chrome OS borked the Sim card.My attempts to get it resolved via AT&T failed, as they don't know how to fix it, and from my sleuthing online, Samsung cannot fix this either.Further, according to Samsung, it is a known failure on these Chromebooks and should be avoided. However, AT&T continues to sell them, knowing there are problems with the Chromebook.For what I've contracted to pay, I am not getting my monies worth, nor can I use the Chromebook on anything other than WiFi, which was not my intention when I got it.For those who may look at this review, All info regarding the failure and known failure is available online from various sites via Google.By beware, but, if you are only going to use it with WiFi, then you might be OK.","Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Go Laptop Computer Lightweight Slim Durable Design 12-Hour Battery Wi-Fi 6 Share Files with Phone, Black,Silver,32GB",&289
14,EndUser,"August 14, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Decent Chromebook, mediocre display, pretty quick for what it is, long battery life","If you're in the market for a low cost Chromebook, and you're willing to live with a screen that's not the best, especially by today's standards, this might be a good option. If you must have a nice display, look elsewhere. The screen in this one is not IPS, and the viewing angles are limited, the resolution is only 1366x768.That said, everything else is good. It's quick, runs smooth, power through everything I threw at it. It streams 4K/60 content from YouTube without dropping frames. (you'll want an external display to appreciate it though!) Benchmarks are better than I expected given it's specs. Results were better than 70% of all users that ran the same benchmark, and 80% better then those using ChromeOS. I used it all day, then into the next and still had over 50% battery left, which it estimated to be nearly 8 more hours of runtime. I think the spec'd 12hr battery life is very realistic. Samsung did a good job tuning this one to get all it's potential, efficiently. Even stressing it like this it doesn't get hot, just barely warm. There's no fans or anything for cooling, so it remains totally silent.The keys feel good, though spacing is a little weird for me. I'll get used to it over time, I guess the same can be said for any new keyboard. The touch pad works well and is responsive. I like that it has a hardware button for clicking, or a tap will also work. It supports the usual gestures and all feels natural.Sound quality is surprisingly good. It's clear and loud with good lows, mids, and highs. The two speakers are down firing mounted in the bottom, and will get a bit muffled when using on a soft surface.The camera is just OK, not great by any means. It will do for Skype and the like, but that's about it.","Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Go Laptop Computer Lightweight Slim Durable Design 12-Hour Battery Wi-Fi 6 Share Files with Phone, Black,Silver,32GB",&289
15,TM,"August 17, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Samsung Quality With Google Hype,"I generally don’t like Chromebooks. They are under-powered and for what they are overpriced. Mainly since so many students had to work from home, and demand for these spiked almost overnight.They started with the noble idea to be an affordable alternative to regular spec notebooks, got more expensive over the years, to the point of a price-bubble that pushed even older models into $500 territory. And still most think of them as an affordable option to ‘real’ computers.The reason why these are so omnipresent is because Google talked school districts into the idea that they are safe to use and easy to administrate. And while there are some really nice rugged models that are built to resist even the above average careless student abuse, many are just cheaply made low-spec laptops. Often using a privately used computer with a different operating system (Lubuntu on an older notebook works great) would do, but some school apps ask for some deep gripping admin rights on the computer. Something I personally don’t want to allow on a device for personal use.But here we are, the new school year begins and many of us parents would rather buy a Chromebook than use a dated one issued by the school. It's either sign up for a ridiculous expensive device insurance or sign to pay in case of damage.  Our school district wants $350 to replace an over ten year old Lenovo in case of a total loss!So putting down the money for this Samsung actually makes sense. Especially since it’s reasonably priced. There isn’t too much to say about the specs. It’s there where it should be, and it works. Samsung is a good brand with a wide variety of products. From all the Samsung products we own and owned, they have been very reliable. I still have a 2014 Galaxy S10 that still keeps going after I handed it down to my daughter.The display is crisp and sharp, the battery life is good for a few hours off the plug, and the quality and feel is great and above average in this price segment. The fact that it looks like metal, but isn’t makes it IMO feel a bit cheaper when touching it. That’s a brain trick and wouldn’t be an issue at all with a solid colored case.The design is inline with the wedge-trend. I wish it would be more functional like older Dells, with the rubber edge and water resistant keyboard, but there are other good options to protect the device from hits and drops. This also means the keyboard is flat with very short travel, meaning the tactile feedback is flat rather than a press like on a traditional full size keyboard.I like that it still comes with a traditional USB-A (the big square) port aside the modern USB-C (small roundish) ports. That means it’s still able to handle older cables, thumb drives, etc. while USB-C gets rid of clunky proprietary power adapters. Also headphone jack!For myself as a parent I can only say: It sucks that options are so limited when it comes down to choosing devices, especially since I would prefer not to have Google peeking into my kids' school career, but for what it is, this is a good choice for a Chromebook; Especially for teens and older who prefer to have their own devices and some style along with it.  So that’s five stars for the product, but with the call to all parents to always ask if there are options to using Chrome OS and if not, why?I hope this helps to make a decision.","Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Go Laptop Computer Lightweight Slim Durable Design 12-Hour Battery Wi-Fi 6 Share Files with Phone, Black,Silver,32GB",&289
16,Bruce and Kathy O'Gorman,"September 19, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,"You know what, I love it!  As a windows laptop user, I was hesitant to make the jump to a Chromebook.  I was fearful the user experience would be tough to adapt to, and I'd end up chucking it in the drawer of other devices I lost interest in using.  I stand corrected!  I love this little laptop, here is what I've noticedPros:1. Battery life is GREAT, I get almost an entire day of surfing and light office work.  Far more than any other  windows based laptop I've used.2. Charging is fast as well.  I can get this thing topped off and ready to keep going while sipping some coffee in the coffee shop doing work.  Before I head out, it's fully charged and ready to go.3. Screen size is great, just big enough to make it easy to see and use, but small enough to keep it compact and easy to transport.  It's also THIN, in a good way.4. very lightweight.6. The keyboard feels great with excellent feedback and spacing.  The center mouse is small enough my wrists don't brush it by accident when typing.7.  Chrome apps work great and there is a lot of integration and cross-function between them.8. Price, it's a great little web server and light-duty word processing and email computer.Cons:1. It may not be Google's fault, but it does not play well with competing apps like Firefox browsers.  Don't expect to find apps with heavy processing needs, no Photoshops etc.  Everything in the Chrome Store is a ""lite version"" but still gets it done.2.  Gestures will take some getting used to.  Instead of a right-click, you two-finger press.3. App layout is a bit cumbersome, file management is as well.4.  Camera quality is still meh.  In the days of Zoom, it's sad the camera on laptops still looks like it's from an old early 2000s flip-phone.  Surely they have better camera tech from their phones they can stick in these things.Overall, a Chromebook makes a great on-the-go tool for anything you'd expect to be able to do on your phone, but with a real keyboard and large screen, and exceptional battery life.  I find this my go-to laptop when I just need to ""get some stuff done""","Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Go Laptop Computer Lightweight Slim Durable Design 12-Hour Battery Wi-Fi 6 Share Files with Phone, Black,Silver,32GB",&289
17,Knowlengr,"August 19, 2021",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Get it for MIL STD testing, Battery Life and Wi-Fi 6","You can get a lot for 300.00 US today.  For amusement, look at mini-PC's, which need external keyboard, mouse and display, but come with desktop-like capabilities and are expandable for more memory.  Sure, they're not laptops, but the core machine is portable, in fact more so than a laptop, so long as your destination has the requisite keyboard, mouse and display.I disgress.For 300.00 US in this instance, you get a long battery life and good Wi-Fi 6, which could be essential for on-the-road journalism, student notes or remote lab projects.If you're an Android user, you get many settings and preferences moved automatically when you set it.  Contrast that with Windows laptops, where more steps are needed to install the apps you need. (Partly this is because Microsoft abandoned their mobile platform.)Samsung made some compromises here, but sometimes you want bare bones.  The machine might be used only occasionally, for children, or may need to be dedicated to a particular purpose, or is needed for public use and will get beat up. Finesse, higher cost, weight and power give you more features, but they are not always needed.I'd like to comment on the ""military grade"" aspect that is claimed, but I didn't see a way to test MILSTD 810G findings.  Let's just say that this is a definite plus for many environments.PRO- Like most current Chromebooks, can use many different USB-C chargers, so long as they have enough wattage for this Galaxy book- Fast setup for Android phone users (as with all Chromebooks)- Good price point- Wi-Fi 6 will be noticeably faster for some users- Battery life is good (12 hrs may be a stretch though, depending on what tasks you throw at it)- 3 USB ports enables external mouse, keyboard, camera/mic (some laptops have fewer ports on their low end offeringts)- MILSTD 810G testingCON- Memory is limited- Screen isn't great at this below-HD resolution but it's fine for most tasks- It's very light, but at 14"", I wish it were closer to 11 or 12 for still better portability. Samsung makes smaller ones but not with these other features- You will miss having a touch screen as you come off your Samsung Galaxy phone- It's ChromeOS which won't have some apps for some users.","Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Go Laptop Computer Lightweight Slim Durable Design 12-Hour Battery Wi-Fi 6 Share Files with Phone, Black,Silver,32GB",&289
18,N. Krumpe,"August 12, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Disappointing display, but reasonable for the price","The low-resolution display and washed out colors are the first things I noticed about this Chromebook. All in all, the display is just kind of disappointing. I know: It's a low-cost Chromebook, and so I should adjust my expectations appropriately. But still, it's hard not for me to get disratcted by the display.Also, I got the model with 32GB of storage. However, 13 of those 32 are used for the system, bringing the available storage down to 19GB. And then, I installed Linux, and the installer recommended that I set aside 10GB for Linux storage. So, now I'm down to 9GB of Chromebook storage. Of course, given that this is a Chromebook, one would not expect as much storage as one would finde on a Windows or Mac machine.Are you using this primarily for editing Google docs and watching YouTube videos? If so, you don't need much storage space (because documents are generally stored in the cloud), and the screen resolution is acceptable. But if you want a Chromebook with decent specs, including a sharp image and plenty of storage, this most definitely is NOT the Chromebook you should be considering alternatives.","Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Go Laptop Computer Lightweight Slim Durable Design 12-Hour Battery Wi-Fi 6 Share Files with Phone, Black,Silver,32GB",&289
19,Dipped in Ink,"September 23, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Simple Laptop for Traveling,"There are plenty of different Chromebook options out there, each with their own pros and cons, but this one has served me well on location for film shoots. Definitely super portable and does have a good battery life. It’s nice and thin, and really quiet as it does not have a cooling fan. I used this mostly for word processing type work with cloud based storage and was impressed! It’s zippy and convenient with the built in Wifi 6.The one feature that is lacking is the display. The resolution is just fine for simple programs, but not super great for any video work. If you are planning on editing videos or photos I don’t think this display will do you any favors. The outer shell is plastic even though it looks metallic in photos, and honestly makes it feel more portable than an expensive MacBook. A good simple computer for a low price to cover your most basic needs.","Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Go Laptop Computer Lightweight Slim Durable Design 12-Hour Battery Wi-Fi 6 Share Files with Phone, Black,Silver,32GB",&289
20,Harold G. Meeks Jr.,"August 14, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good Battery Life, OK Screen","This Chromebook is lightweight and cuts a slender profile. Aesthetically, it looks good with a familiar wedge shape in silver plastic with a black interior. It feels sturdy and rigid. The keyboard is nicely laid out and has good key action for typing. The trackpad is a decent size and tracks smoothly. The Chromebook charges via USB-C - wall charger and USB-C cable is included. There are two USB-C connectors, USB-A, headphone jack and microSD card slot. Battery life is quite good - I was able to go for an extended editing session for a few hours and still had plenty of battery left. It comes with 32 GB of storage which is sufficient for editing documents, spreadsheets, surfing the web or other lightweight tasks since most content is stored in the cloud. Performance is fine - it feels responsive and never left me waiting. Playback of 1080p streaming video is smooth. The one area of needed improvement is the display. Viewing angles are restricted and colors are not as saturated as they could be - but adjusted at the right angle it’s OK in use. On the other hand, the sound is good - nice midrange and high end, with a bit of bass. Overall, this is a nice-looking Chromebook that offers good battery life and performance for the price.","Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Go Laptop Computer Lightweight Slim Durable Design 12-Hour Battery Wi-Fi 6 Share Files with Phone, Black,Silver,32GB",&289

The end of life for the  samsung chromebook 3 is this year in June. I've been looking for an affordable chromebook similar to what I have now and has the farthest end of life date so far for price.The Samsung chromebook go is just that. I also was able to make payments as well. It's a way wider screen and even though I see many reviews on how bad the screen is, the chromebook 3 from the same maker is the same quality as well, but this chromebook go looks good to me. It's sleek trying to pose as a MacBook. It's light and has a USB C charging cable that's perfect for my Samsung s21 phone as well. I also play games on it with my Amazon Luna account and it's faster than my phone, old chromebook, Kindle, and fire stick when playing games.I've had PC laptops that were at the 500 price range and they could install programs, but starting it up would take 10 minutes and it was slow loading anything. Plus I needed anti-virus software if I wanted it to work better. But I really didn't use my PC for those extras, I just used it for Google search, email, social apps, and streaming.
