0,Tyler Ward,"June 4, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Slim Sleek Beautiful Power Hungry Beast,"A good place to start would be that I got this chromebook at a discount ($749, down from $999). And my needs are mainly to run Citrix (through browser or Chrome app, either works) for work and to casually browse, read magazines/books or listen to Spotify.  Not a ""Power User"" by any means, though not sure any Chrome OS user is.That being said, this is THE BEST CHROMEBOOK I'VE EVER USED, and it is more than perfect to suit my needs.Build: The thing is beautiful, a really premium feel to the materials, and the red is really classy and not too gaudy as I was a bit worried and almost went with the more drab grey option - I'm glad I didn't. The chrome ring around the outside is also a premium touch that looks great. It's the thinnest and lightest 2-in-1 laptop I've ever seen, and I know that I like to use 2-in-1s in tablet mode and this is the first time it actually feels comfortable and feasible to do that for more than a brief period of time. The 2.2lbs was a big draw for me when comparing this laptop to the Galaxy Chromebook 2, Asus C436, or the Acer Spin 713 - upon using it I am glad I took it into consideration. Other great things about the build are the relatively loud stereo speakers and the built-in stylus. Minor drawbacks would be the weak hinge that doesn't always hold the screen in place when moving the laptop if open (though for the most part it does the job) and the lack of ports (you just get 2 USB-C ports, which also function as charging ports, so if you're charging you only have 1...adapters easily solve this). Also the cameras are weak but I don't use those - if you're buying for camera quality only for some reason (Zoom?) then this isn't the one for you.Screen: The SCREEN is AMAZING. The OLED is top notch and better than any Chromebook I've ever seen, at full brightness the colors are insane. That being said, the high resolution and the brightness eat at the battery life a lot, so in most cases I've got brightness scaled way down and I don't really miss anything, it works fine. Touch works perfectly, the stylus allows for really detailed notes/drawings in Canva or other apps. One drawback might be the bezel placement, there are 3 super-thin outer bezels and one larger bottom bezel... in tablet mode that one larger bezel functions well as a ""handle"" of sorts, but the other sides can't be touched without accidentally hitting the screen and scrolling or clicking a link, etc. A very minor nuisance at most. Another minor issue is that the resolution is SO GOOD that when I run Citrix, the session almost appears blurry, but still workable - on high resolution windows machines Citrix has addressed this with DPI scaling, but they've yet to master this on the Chrome OS app or the Chrome web app. Not Samsung's issue, but still part of my experience with the machine so I thought it worth mentioning.Performance: This thing is a BEAST. There's arguably no need for an Intel i5 in a Chromebook, but here we are, and the thing is FAST. Scrolling is smooth and even with tons of tabs open I've never experienced lag when playing videos or games. With lots going on under the hood, and no fan, I've heard mention from others that the computer can get really hot under heavy loads - I've barely experienced this while using a decent amount of processing power, and would elaborate that when I did feel heat it was very minor and not unbearable by any means. I'm thinking unless you are gaming a lot or developing in linux or doing something really really processor heavy, you'll be fine. A small performance gripe in general is that Android apps don't always play well with Chrome OS and have re-sizing issues or some lag, but this is not a Samsung problem, more of a Google problem.Battery Life: Some people have called this the achilles heel of the laptop, but I don't have much issue. Again, I'm not a real gamer/developer/super user - I am Joe Basic using it for administrative work and browsing/music/reading. On an average day at like 70% brightness I can unplug at 8am and make it to about 3 or 4pm before having to plug back in while working in Citrix doing basic tasks on MS Access, Excel, etc - nothing intense but that's pretty much constant screentime for about 6-7 hours before it starts getting low and I've got to plug in. Obviously this is not great in comparison to 10+ hours at full brightness seen on other Chromebooks - but you are getting more than the average Chromebook here and this is a bit of a concession made on Samsung's part to provide the rest of the goods. Overall if you don't need to be away from a charger for more than 6 hours every day, you shouldn't have an issue.Should you buy it: If you have read this far and think your needs/usage are similar to mine and you want the sleek-est, coolest, thinnest chromebook out there, DEFINITELY BUY THIS (especially if on discount, which it frequently is between Amazon, Best Buy, and Samdsung's own site).","SAMSUNG 13.3"" Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, HD Intel Core I-5 Processor, Ultra Slim, US Warranty, Fiesta Red",&1033
1,RemixDaMix,"August 8, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful image poor battery.,"Bought this Chromebook because it was decently priced (under $600), didn't have a Celeron, was thin and wanted to try my hand at something that wasn't Windows based.Took a bit of time figuring out how to navigate and am kind of still learning but this laptop is very appealing for what I was wanting to use it for. It's the only Chromebook I know with a 4k resolution screen, not that I was wanting it for that, but the image quality looks stunning. The i-5 processor is fast enough to handle most any daily functions and the thin stylings of the laptop itself is very appealing. It comes with a stylus that's installed directly into the machine and works flawlessly. Audio isn't anything to brag about but does get plenty loud for most entertainment options. I normally use it to watch a sports game while playing board games with friends or watching Youtube videos to learn said board games. Convertible mode is exactly what you'd expect but was surprised the laptop doesn't get extremely hot when the screen is folded to block the air vents. Is small and light enough that it doesn't seem so burdensome but large enough that it doesn't feel like I'm typing on something meant for a child.My biggest issue though is the 4k screen. I can watch all forms of resolution on this laptop but have no options to force the resolution to something lower to help save on battery life and boy is the 4k screen a energy hog. My entire view point before buying this was that I knew the battery life wasn't that great but figured I'd just lower the resolution and get whatever I could out of the battery but was disappointed to find out that's impossible. Don't get me wrong the 4k screen is beyond beautiful but now I need to plan accordingly if I'll be out and about with this Chromebook, something I didn't really expect when purchasing the product.All in all I'm happy with this product and as long as the battery life isn't a complete deal breaker then I highly recommend.","SAMSUNG 13.3"" Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, HD Intel Core I-5 Processor, Ultra Slim, US Warranty, Fiesta Red",&1033
2,Kindle Customer,"July 26, 2021",3.0 out of 5 stars,"The best resolution screen of any computer, but otherwise there are many issues.","If I needed a computer merely for streaming content and wanted the best quality and highest resolution, then this is the clear leader and without exception the best offered in the market.  If you need it to do other things it is best to look at something else.Despite the short battery life (around 4 hours of continuous use video streaming of Amazon prime HD offerings), I was willing to accept that, but constant and continuous other issues resulted in making me nuts.  So what are the issues?1. It gets hot and I don't mean warm, I mean hot enough to redden the skin if you are holding it on your lap.  Everytime it got that hot which happens after using it for over a hour or so, I would elevate it on a rack I use for cooling cookies when they come out of the oven.  This allowed air to constantly be under the laptop.  Did it help?  No.  If you are intending to use this for several hours straight, you need to invest in a base which has a fan blowing cool air onto the bottom.  This means the portabiity just went out the window.2. Touchscreen fails to respond.  It is maddening to be in the middle of a project only to have your touch screen stop responding to touch, provided epen, touch pad or cursor with a mouse.  It was necessary to close everything down and restart the computer to fix it.3.  Keyboard touches opens random programs.  This one was really puzzling.  I would be typing and all of a sudden an program would open.  I assumed I must have inadvertently touched something on the keyboard while typing, but have no clue as to what it was.  Since I didn't know what caused it, I was unable to avoid doing it.4. Weird keyboards show up on touch screen and you cant get them to close.  I know there are times when you are using this in tablet mode that you want the keyboard to be on the screen.  However why one would appear when you are typing was yet another mystery.  How to get rid of it was equally puzzling.  To add insult to injury, the keyboard which would show up differed from one time to another.  Occasionally it was the Qwerty type, but frequently it was not.  (One of them had row upon row of yellow circle face icons for heavens sake!)  I would get rid of one only to have another show up.5. Settings change without my input.  You go to settings and have the computer's cursor, screen layout, wallpaper etc all set up to your own personal preferences.  Then without any rhyme or reason they are changed.  Yes it is easy to go back and set them again, but I shouldn't have to do this and it is a pain in the butt to keep reconfiguring they physical look of the display.6. Bluetooth devices don't always stay paired.  Once you have scanned and selected a blue tooth device, I am used to it always being on the list of available devices which you can then click to quickly reconnect.  Here on a few occasions I had to go back to the repairing process to get them to connect.  Again another time waster.There were othe6 I knew about before I purchased such as there only being a couple C type outlets.  I had this issue with another Samsung product so had already purchased the doogle (dongle?) so that I could plug in my memory cards, usb and micro USB cords.Other positives are the look. This had to be the best looking laptop I have ever seen.  Only the blue Samsung Galaxy laptop for windows looks as good. The built in epin when working was fabulous.  You could set it up to magnify the screen, take a screenshot, etc so it allowed versatility not often seen in similar chromebooks.  It is fast.  Everything moved so quickly, and the processing was better than any other chromebook I have used to date.I know the new Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 has worked to solve some of these issues.  Unfortunately that has been done at the expense of factors which made the thing so great to start out with.  In short if these are ever just a few hundred dollars I will get one for video streaming as I do a lot of it.  But for over 600.?  No not ever.","SAMSUNG 13.3"" Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, HD Intel Core I-5 Processor, Ultra Slim, US Warranty, Fiesta Red",&1033

4,Blugo_47,"April 1, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,Patience is KEY! Also speakers are kind of meh.....,"Had to go through 3 devices to finally get one that was properly built, as Samsung's quality control is really hit or miss, especially for this device for some reason, so you're basically playing the lottery. Luckily, Amazon's customer service is one of the best in the industry so I was able to get one that functioned properly and was assembled correctly. As far as how it performs, you won't be disappointed, I view this as more of a leisure device opposed to productivity, so far that use case it really is a treat. The screen is gorgeous, blacks are actually black, contrast is through the roof, and colors are so vibrant and full of life that you'll struggle going back to regular screens. The build quality(when you get a good unit) is great, very premium and sturdy, while still being very lightweight. It feels really nice in the hands, and it has the benefit of being just as nice to use as it is to look at. Seriously this is one of the most beautiful computers out there, not just for a chromebook, the metallic cherry red just pops and the silver chrome edges are such a nice touch, it really is a shame that Samsung doesn't offer this color scheme in any other device, I'd love to see it on a windows laptop for example, and like won't ever. All in all, this is a rather expensive chromebook, you're definitely paying a premium for this device, but if you're looking for a great screen, beautiful design, in a premium lightweight chassis, that functions as a tablet replacement of sorts, then this is the chromebook for you.","SAMSUNG 13.3"" Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, HD Intel Core I-5 Processor, Ultra Slim, US Warranty, Fiesta Red",&1033

6,CloudE Solutions,"April 23, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing laptop with very poor battery and heating issues.,"I regret purchasing this laptop on the promise that Samsung was working with Google regarding the power issue.  Samsung seems caught off guard with the battery life being only 4 hours with very consrvitive power usage.I have been looking around for an improved battery to replace the one that came inside my Samsun Galaxy Chromebook but doesn't seem to be anything new out there.  Unfortunately I have a laptop that can only be used around 4 hours on battery.This said I have been watching videos on Youtube where owners claim they get 6-8 hours of battery with brightness to 80+ percent, do i have a  bad battery or they happen to have a better release?Everything else about this Chromebook seems fine, however, my 8gb isn't that as I look to see the ram it uses 7.65Gb, this is Chromebook thing because traditionally you would have much more available for programs you have yet to opena nd run?  Less than 1 Gb available for whatever lolFinding programs in the app store that is full screen or landscape is difficult and have found some that do do not run well at all... the Galaxy Chromebook is concidered a very powerful machine, but seems to struggle at almost anything I load into it except games.  I did load a simple game but failed to keep running and crashes constantly.Perhaps I am asking too much from this Chromebook, I do not do much, mostly edit my website, write small blogs, spreadsheets, email and videos on YT and movies I've purchased.  That pretty much it!I don't recommend this model.Before all of this, I tried to order the original Pixelbook but Amazon accidentally sent me a high end Pixelbook Go (Not PInk), and being the honest person I am returned it and then ended up ordering the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook instead.","SAMSUNG 13.3"" Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, HD Intel Core I-5 Processor, Ultra Slim, US Warranty, Fiesta Red",&1033
7,Glenn Brensinger,"December 1, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great device!,"This thing is so cool! Usually I try to go with the latest and greatest if I can justify the cost, but the reviews of this year’s Chromebook 2 vs last year’s Chromebook helped me make the decision to go with last year’s model. Better screen, fingerprint reader, and the fact that instead of $999 it cost less than $600 (plus some credit I already had with Amazon, so I paid less than $300 for it.) It’s starting to compete with my iPad Pro as my daily driver, since most of what I do is web based anyway.The only issue I have is with the touch screen. When I flip the screen to put it in tablet mode, the touch screen stops working until I restart it. The problem is I can’t tell if it’s a hardware problem / defective unit, or if there is an issue with the latest release of ChromeOS. Unfortunately I have asked the question in three places and have not received a response. I am hoping it’s just a glitch with the Chrome OS, because I really like this thing. I even have Crossover running Windows apps and have had no issues with lagging. It’s not getting warm at all (there is no cooling fan.) Did I mention you can run Linux apps on a Chromebook now too? I wasn’t sure about the Fiesta Red, at first I thought it would be too loud, but I’m glad I did it. Shiny and cool looking.Update to my review - the touch screen problem was fixed by Powerwashing it.","SAMSUNG 13.3"" Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, HD Intel Core I-5 Processor, Ultra Slim, US Warranty, Fiesta Red",&1033
8,WUA (Christian Walloth),"January 30, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,A stunning notebook,"I'd definitely buy this notebook again. And not only because it's the most fancy chromebook on the market. But also because ...It's super thin, super lightweight. Yet it feels sturdy and well built. It's hard to spot any piece of plastic on this notebook.The orange-red color is just beautiful. It's not anything near a sharp or aggressive orange. It's a super warm, slightly metallic color. Truly particular. It sits beautifully on wooden desks as well as on any more office-like desk surface. The color tone changes slightly with the light.It has an exchangeable SSD. Not an (slower) eMMC, and neither is it a non-replaceable chip. Whoever had to trash an entire notebook just because the SSD or eMMC failed, knows that having this unit replaceable matters. Also financially.The keyboard feels great. What a masterpiece of engineering. I mean, the whole lower part of the notebook is barely 6mm thick.Not to talk about the display. It probably outperforms most others on the market (and particularly at this price point).What they talk about in reviews, negatively:- short battery life. Indeed. 4-6hrs. That's few. But if they'd asked me to increase battery life and weight and size or leave it at it is, I'd opted for as it is. I just don't need more than 4-6 hrs of battery life; there's always a plug somewhere.- shaking display: true – when used on the lap while sitting on the sofa. When the notebook sits on a stable surface, like a desk, the hinges hold the display in place and it won't shake.What they don't talk about and what I personally find is a shortcoming:- the quality of sound from the internal speakers is low and I cannot enjoy it for all the video conferences we are having nowadays.Some people ask, why someone would need such a powerful chromebook. Because google understood the cloud, because there's no need for servicing, updating, IT people for your (small) business company. Because it's productivity focused. And because, yes, I literally have about 100 tabs open all the time, on different virtual screens, and sometimes even two accounts logged in, and it is still fast.","SAMSUNG 13.3"" Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, HD Intel Core I-5 Processor, Ultra Slim, US Warranty, Fiesta Red",&1033

12,Mohammad Ashori,"August 12, 2021",3.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing but beautiful,"The laptop is pretty to look at and it's thin. The screen is a really nice quality but doesn't outshine a MacBook but maybe a little better than the pixelbool. When you use it as a tablet it doesn't close fully so it's floppy and you can't really hold it because the bezels are so small you're always touching the screen. A common issue many have reported is the touchpad which jumps all over but that's a software issue with other apps which are incompatible. I deleted a bunch and it worked but dunno which was the culprit.If you are buying this because you hope to use other Samsung devices with this seamlessly, well, my galaxy buds don't always pair with this and there is no interface which I was surprised by. In fact you can't use the apps for galaxy devices with this Chromebook.It doesn't recognize my Samsung phone even which my Google pixelbook does a slightly better job at. The fingerprint scanner works maybe 50 percent of the time because it doesn't pick up my fingerprints well. Battery life isn't great but it hasn't been too bad for me. It's fast and rarely have I seen it glitch. I would have returned it for sure if I was still in the US but I bought it and left the country. I bought it to replace my pixelbook wthoch I've beat up a lot but even in it's poor state I use the pixelbook 90 percent of the time.I wanted to add to this review - it's really hard to use this laptop because when you turn it into a tablet it doesn't close all the way so you're holding something a little floppy. And the edges of the screen are so small that you're constantly activating something with your finger pads. Ironically, as sensitive as these edges are when you click on something on the screen it doesn't really register the finger well and you have to press a little hard.I'm comparing this to my Chromebook Pixel and it lacks a lot.Update March 2022.The screen quality isn't that high to explain why the battery runs out so fast. The screen not closing all the way against the case in tablet mode remains a big problem in terms of usability.I can't manage to keep the pads of my hand to activate the screen when maneuvering this laptop. A zero bezel is terrible even on a phone much less a touchscreen laptop.","SAMSUNG 13.3"" Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, HD Intel Core I-5 Processor, Ultra Slim, US Warranty, Fiesta Red",&1033
13,Logan Burmania,"February 27, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sexy computer, but battery life is a deal breaker","If this product actually got the reported 11 hours of battery life, this would be a 5 star review. The overall build quality of the Chromebook and the screen quality is absolutely brilliant. I was a bit nervous about Chrome OS, but its incredibly intuitive and feels a lot like Mac OS. Linux apps were a bit of a hassle to download, but they ran perfectly.The battery life is just unacceptable. After multiple tries, I was not able to get more than 4 hours of battery on less than 50% brightness. This Chromebook cannot be used as a mobile machine, unless you plan on being next to an outlet all the time. I bought this Chromebook for taking notes in class, but this wouldn't even last a half a day of classes. Only buy this if you don't plan on using it while mobile. It also can get hot to the touch, but it never went above 70 C.I ended up returning the Chromebook and got the Samsung Galaxybook Pro 360 instead, and I'm much happier with this purchase. It doesn't beat the screen on Samsung's Chromebook, but the battery life last all day and there's only a noticeable difference in the screen quality when up close.","SAMSUNG 13.3"" Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, HD Intel Core I-5 Processor, Ultra Slim, US Warranty, Fiesta Red",&1033

I've never seen a thinner screen on anything. The chrome OS makes the 8Gb of RAM and i5 core processor seem like overkill for what I use it for which is primarily viewing streaming video and some gaming. I could do with a little more battery life, a better way to vent the heat and more solid feet on the bottom and louder internal speakers.

15,Amazon Customer,"March 25, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it despite flaws.,"* The left arrow key doesn't reliably connect unless I hit it much harder than I have to hit the other keys.* It's a roll of the dice whether the laptop shuts off or merely sleeps when I close the lid, which means when I re-open it I'm often faced with a full restart, and Chrome has to re-load all my tabs etc. This seems to reset brightness preferences: the screen starts up intolerably dim, for some reason.* Even worse, occasionally when I re-open the laptop it's in this weird state where it seems to think it's on, but the screen is completely black and I have to force a restart. This is both annoying and concerning.* The keyboard is technically backlit, but the light is so dim that it barely helps even when it's dark.* The trackpad is easily pushed down to click near its bottom, but gets increasingly difficult as you go up, which just feels really weird and inconsistent. More than 1/2 of the way up, it's too hard to press for me to practically want to.Despite all the flaws, I love this machine. It's super light. I like the feel of the construction. I like the color. I really like having the browser back/forward/refresh on the keyboard. The stylus, working with Android art programs I already knew and loved, has been a delight. It's really nice to be able to go right from typing an article to drawing illustrations for it on the same device. Being able to run android apps natively on a 2-in-1 is really cool (even though realistically I'd often be better off using the desktop versions of apps on a mac or windows machine -- for example, Slack and Discord do not provide a great experience running their android app in chromos, compared with the experience of their desktop applications on mac. And in other cases, like Webtoons, I'm realistically better off just visiting the webpage. But running the app natively is so cool!).","SAMSUNG 13.3"" Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, HD Intel Core I-5 Processor, Ultra Slim, US Warranty, Fiesta Red",&1033

The difference that an amoled makes really is worth the extra money but be warned that netflix and google play will not allow you to watch content in anything higher than 720p and 420p respectively.I found this out last night when trying to buy black panther on google play to watch in HD. It would not play in anything more than 420p!When watching normal - not payed for - YouTube you can watch in 4k and the screen looks truly stunning. The quality in places is so high it feels 3D.The battery life leaves something to be desired. For me it is just over 3 hours. This can vary widely depending on what you are watching. When working on code in a terminal, the amoled showing black allows the battery to last a lot longer. The issue comes from trying to run a 4k screen, doing so requires a lot more computation which makes it all the more of a shame that 4k content is particularly scarce.The stylus works incredibly well, writing on this is a dream.I bought this for the amoled screen and chrome os and the issues with battery and 4k content are frustraiting but for me at least do not detract from how lovely the machine is to use.","SAMSUNG 13.3"" Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, HD Intel Core I-5 Processor, Ultra Slim, US Warranty, Fiesta Red",&1033

In Fiesta Red, the Galaxy catches eyes and the form build looks like a colorful piece of thick cardboard.  Currently, Amazon is selling this for $799.99 ($200 less than I purchased the unit a week ago.) I work with Windoze and Mac professionally but at home, I enjoy using several Samsung tablets, the Chromebook Pro and other quality products from the company.I was really on the fence as I have a Samsung Pro from 2 years back and it does all that I need, Yet the lure of a better screen and CPU chip finally enticed me. I also welcome the Bluetooth 5 for earbuds and the lightness of the overall unit.As others have mentioned, the battery life when using the quality screen settings are a little below four hours, weak compared to the Asus Flip, with almost better specs- but the Flip doesn't have the quality screen this unit does. (I'm not carrying a charger with me when a battery pack will do the job.)The added functionality of Android apps, which are not always available with other brands, make this Galaxy a winner.

The computer did arrive with a dead battery which I can see why as having a full battery ship can be explosive. But the same did I received the computer, I did notice the trackpad was causing me a lot of issues. Like a lot!! The trackpad was not working at all. Period.

23,Jared Carlson,"November 12, 2020",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Couch Laptop,"Early impressions - Impossibly thin. Android apps are surprisingly better than web app variants. Red is the laptop color I never knew I needed. The keyboard travel and ""thud"" is satisfying and the trackpad is Apple level.Like every other review, the battery is abysmal compared to any ultrabook in 2020 (3-4 hours max with comfortable brightness). However, this is the best home laptop you can get right now. The design is hard to appreciate until it's in your hands, but I have never seen a thinner device with an i5 chip. It gets warm without a fan but nothing uncomfortable. The pen performs better than the gen 1 Apple Pencil I'm coming off of. I can't say this is great for art, but you get access to Concepts in the Play store and Adobe Draw. I do wish Samsung Notes was an option given the Galaxy name, but here we are. Big, big fan of using my mobile only fantasy football app (Sleeper) on a bigger screen. Most Android apps I've installed are responsive which helps to avoid going fullscreen/forced to use the touchscreen in portrait.Connecting a Dualshock4 controller was effortless, didn't need to configure for Among Us either. Some games like Shadowfall will need some effort to work. No CoD Mobile support was a bummer, hopefully in an update.Complaints: The screen looks great, however no 4k support on most streaming options AND due to the OLED this screen is very dim by default. If you have it at 50% your eyes will be strained after an hour. 70% is comfortable, getting 4 hours average.If you're looking to continue your Android experience in laptop form, this is the way.","SAMSUNG 13.3"" Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, HD Intel Core I-5 Processor, Ultra Slim, US Warranty, Fiesta Red",&1033

Once you get used to keeping it charged it lasts all night or all day no problem. The best laptop I have had personally. Screen has great quality, the color is amazing, loads extremely fast and does very well with having multiple tabs open at once. A solid 9.5 out of 10 for me. 1 con I found is overtime the mousepad is easily subject to damage if not cared for properly.

Not all google play apps run smoothly some crash and it is almost impossible to run them. Google needs to work with the developers to make Chromebook specific apps, otherwise this is going to be trouble. I love that it has more than one thunderbolt connection. I have a ethernet to thunderbolt adapter and the internet goes twice as fast vs wifi and I have a premium mesh system, so this is great, because I am not a fan of wifi.

The beautiful red solid aluminum body and stunning AMOLED touch-screen are the stars of this show.  Unfortunately, there's an unfortunate detraction in the form of the trackpad sometimes freezing up and I believe it's due to the machine running too hot.  Shutting the machine down and letting it cool down fixes the issue.  A more practical workaround is using a cooling pad or pairing a mouse to keep working when the trackpad isn't.  For my use case, I can live with the issue as I really enjoy viewing photographs or videos on such an amazing display but your mileage will vary.","SAMSUNG 13.3"" Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, HD Intel Core I-5 Processor, Ultra Slim, US Warranty, Fiesta Red",&1033

No, it hasn't left burn marks on my skin but it gets hot enough to be very uncomfortable.
