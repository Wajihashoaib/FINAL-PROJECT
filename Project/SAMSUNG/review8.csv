0,Steph,"May 11, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth every penny!,"After spending alot of time researching many different chromebooks, tablets and laptops in the $200-500 that would best suit my needs I found myself getting frustrated and overwhelmed by the process and was about 30 seconds from giving up and settling on one that was not ideal just to get the process over with. That is when this beauty miraculously appeared! Not only did it check 9 out of 10 of the boxes I needed it to, it was also 1/2 the price compared to others I researched in this category.  I love the design and versatility of having a laptop and tablet in one option.  I also like that unlike some of the other 2 in 1 chromebooks it is not flimsy and they clearly took into consideration the lifestyle needs of a 2 in 1 chromebook keeping it lightweight yet very sturdy. The battery life is wonderful, it charges quickly and a full charged has lasted me over a full day at work as I used it continuously for a total of 10.45hrs before it got down to the red at 15%. And that was without turning on the battery saver option! The display is clean, crisp & vivid. Whether it's used for streaming a movie or creating a new document, you will be satisfied with the visuals for sure. Set up was a breeze as was learning the ins and outs of all this chromebook offers. The only ""complaint"" I have in regards to this specific model is the lack of protective cases designed to fit it. I understand this is not a issue about the product itself but I did want to make people aware of it as there is only 1 brand of hard cover cases that fit it and do not have to be removed for use(mCover hard shell case for 12.2in Samsung v2 chromebook).I highly recommend also using a padded waterproof shock absorbent carry case as well for travel, as the hard case is mainly to protect from scratches and dings and WILL NOT protect it in the event it is dropped, banged or similar.  The other recommendation is a 9H screen protector, especially if you plan to use the touch screen and stylist pen options. If I could give it 10stars I would.  Hands down this is the best purchase I have made this year, I only wish I found it sooner!","Samsung Chromebook Plus V2, 2-in-1, 4GB RAM, 32GB eMMC, 13MP Camera, Chrome OS, 12.2"", 16:10 Aspect Ratio, Light Titan (XE520QAB-K01US)",&299

2,chizzie,"June 26, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Delightfully happy!,"I purchased this on PRIME day and got a really great deal. :)I've only ever used Apple products.... and the last laptop I purchased in 2010 was a Macbook Air. Needlesstoday, it's now super outdated and, given that my email, photos and browsing is always on Google, it made sense to move to a Chromebook. Sorry Apple. But I'm still loyal to your iPhone.WHAT I LIKE about my NEW CHROMEBOOK!>> I like the keyboard! Unlike a mac where I felt like I could barely feel the keys, I can 'feel 'the keys on this pc and typing seems easier.>> Ease of use: Charge and GO!  Upon receipt, just charge your Chromebook right away. Then, open 'er up, put in your google credentials and you're on your way.>>Screen: well lit, colors are great.>>Sound: EXCELLENT.  Clear, sharp, great stereo sound. (ha, stereo! I needed to call that out? I'm a 70s girl so, yeah.)>> Consider getting yourself a wireless mouse with a beanbag wrist rest, and, pick up a microSD card to give your little machine more storage. I'm not big on touch pads so, call me old school but I like using a mouse :)>> FUN FACTOR: It's just a fun machine.  I like it! And I haven't even tried the stylus or other cool features yet!WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:>> so far - there's nothing that I don't like about this Chromebook. Happy customer right here! And this was after (seriously people) agonizing over 3+ hours over WHICH brand to buy.  I'm glad I went with Samsung!>> Oh, there is this one thing. AMAZON: why would you package this sleek, cool Samsung Chromebook in a GIGANTIC, over-sized box that looked like it could have held about 8 Chromebooks?  The machine (which was packed in its own box) was 100% jostling around in transit. There's no doubt. There was the thought of a small, crumpled amount of brown paper packing material that was in there for... show? Because you would have needed about 25 pieces of crumpled brown packing material to have secured the Chromebook.","Samsung Chromebook Plus V2, 2-in-1, 4GB RAM, 32GB eMMC, 13MP Camera, Chrome OS, 12.2"", 16:10 Aspect Ratio, Light Titan (XE520QAB-K01US)",&299

5,Person,"February 1, 2020",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome battery life, heavier than expected, pen is fine","I like this computer.I received it yesterday and spent the entire evening getting used to it. The laptop comes with a stylus, and a power cable. I think it's made of plastic but it feels pretty solid, and it's way heavier than I expected. I fear I may drop it because of it's weight. Out of the box it has no power, you must plug it in to the wall with your provided cable.Some issues are that there is one dead pixel that has been present ever since I turned on the device. I don't really care for it as it's so tiny, but I know that some may not be okay with it for it appears to be an irremovable speck of dirt. Another issue is that the stylus has a bit of delay. Another is that the scrolling is a bit wonky in Android apps, I can not use two fingers on the mouse pad to scroll in the Discord app for example, but I can use the pen/my finger to operate it from the screen as I would on my phone. This makes sense since it is an Android app after all, but it'd be nice to not have to switch back and forth from laptop to pen abilities. The app drawer is only properly functionable when using the pen or your finger.I fell asleep with it the laptop on, and woke several hours later. My battery did not empty in my absence of activity, and none of my progress was lost. Though it did not lock my screen, but I am pretty sure I can fix that in the settings. I am just amazed that it did not die and nothing was lost even though I left it for several hours. The laptop is also extremely quiet I now realize, I have not heard a single mechanical noise coming from it and I am typing this from a silent room.Also, Chrome OS isn't that bad, I had planned to attempt to download Ubuntu on it, I am still going to get it to have more useful software available, but I will also use Chrome OS since it's not as bad as I thought it would be.Overall the computer is pretty epic","Samsung Chromebook Plus V2, 2-in-1, 4GB RAM, 32GB eMMC, 13MP Camera, Chrome OS, 12.2"", 16:10 Aspect Ratio, Light Titan (XE520QAB-K01US)",&299
6,David Edwards,"March 27, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's more like ""2/3 laptop, 1/3 tablet"" rather than a 2-in-1.","I've been in the market for a cheap laptop for work for a while.  I have a hefty gaming PC at home but I wanted something completely separate and portable for non-gaming needs like using the internet and word processing.  Additionally I've been trying to read more and sometimes this leads to me using the Kindle app on my phone.  I was drawn to the Chromebook Plus (V2) because of the attempts to make it more like a tablet and utilize Android apps.Overall the product works exactly as described.  The screen is good, though the default settings make the things like the app shelf, window borders, and pointer size a little too large in comparison to the parts of the screen in use.  This is variable once you poke around the settings, though, and I have no complaints.  The keyboard is fantastic and responsive.  The touchscreen is pretty good, though it's not quite on par with the perfection that is an iPad touch screen.  Sometimes I miss when I try to click on things with my finger or perhaps it doesn't register at all.  That happens so infrequently that it's still entirely usable.  The pen is also nice, though I've only used it so far to doodle in the Google Keep notes app as it was not a main selling point for me.  The battery life is about on par with what is advertised; I used it lightly from 7:30-2:30 yesterday, for example, and it only got to about 50%.  The foldability for tent and tablet mode is a little bit awkward considering the size and the fact that the keyboard is always attached, but it works.  It just makes me prefer it as a laptop more than a tablet most of the time.The performance is acceptable considering the hardware.  With my other machine having a much more powerful processor and more RAM, I actually do notice a bit of delay in navigation online and when using multiple apps.  With that said, it's not bad at all, and the comparison is actually rather unfair.My main complaint is really only the quality of the touchpad for using the cursor.  It works well, but it's a little bit choppy and doesn't respond to light and subtle movements when trying to be precise.  Again, this might be unfair because the only recent laptops I've used have been MacBooks and those touchpads are incredibly smooth, but it's still worth pointing out.Overall I'm highly satisfied with my purchase.  The problems I've described really aren't even problems but rather little quirks that I've already gotten used to.  It works for everything you'd want a Chromebook to work for and it does it well.","Samsung Chromebook Plus V2, 2-in-1, 4GB RAM, 32GB eMMC, 13MP Camera, Chrome OS, 12.2"", 16:10 Aspect Ratio, Light Titan (XE520QAB-K01US)",&299

8,bthsllnk,"October 5, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good Chromebook well worth the money,"I bought this chromebook plus v2 used, it was supposed to have blemishes on the back. But so far I haven't found any. It looks and acts like new. I needed to replace my old acer chromebook that was starting to freeze up. So far I'm very happy with this Samsung chromebook. It's still under warrenty, the keyboard is very responsive and clicky. I use it mainly for work, editing videos, photos then uploading them to my website. Granted I've only had it for a few days but it's been very fast without any lag. I typically have about 8-10 tabs open at a time, this hasn't caused any slow downs. It got about 3 updates when I got it up and running. It's now on chrome 93.0.4577.95. Having the s-pen is also a bonus since I do some journaling. So far I'm happy with my purchase. It is a bit heavy so keep that in mind. Battery life is about average nothing great. I do wish that each side had a usb C port instead of them both on the left side. But the charging cord is long so I'm making due.","Samsung Chromebook Plus V2, 2-in-1, 4GB RAM, 32GB eMMC, 13MP Camera, Chrome OS, 12.2"", 16:10 Aspect Ratio, Light Titan (XE520QAB-K01US)",&299
9,Donte Hollister,"March 4, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Kids Chromebook,"I bought this because when you look up small compact laptops to edit photos for photography this pops up. So I bought it because if the features that come with it and it seemed like a cool computer to have. WRONG! With all the cool things this thing can do it can’t even run photoshop, it can only run photoshop express and they are not the same. It’s basically an android phone but on a foldable laptop. Didn’t bother checking out any of the other features because it’s not what I wanted. But if you want a small laptop for drawing and playing games on then this is perfect. I wish there was real reviews letting customers know the specifics cause it may have been delivered fast but it’s ultimately a waste of time.","Samsung Chromebook Plus V2, 2-in-1, 4GB RAM, 32GB eMMC, 13MP Camera, Chrome OS, 12.2"", 16:10 Aspect Ratio, Light Titan (XE520QAB-K01US)",&299

11,Ian B,"November 24, 2018",3.0 out of 5 stars,Decent convertible with tradeoffs,"This is a decent hybrid and good for basic browser/tablet tasks. If you try to do much more with it, you might be disappointed. I'm ok with the $350 Black Friday price, but would be disappointed if I spent $500 on this, so giving it 3 stars instead of 4. Paying $600 for the m3 processor would be too much for this class of device, especially with only 4gb ram. It does fine for browsing, but Android apps can be kind of glitchy.  Touch responsiveness can be spotty in tablet mode. This might be ChromeOS' fault, but it's an advertised feature and should be expected to work. Using a 2k external monitor over usb-c works, but is choppy. I'm guessing this is a combination of the low ram and integrated graphics (cpu usage wasn't high). I wouldn't do it regularly. I like that is has 2 usb-c ports, but putting them both on the same side is annoying. The screen half is much heavier than other laptops I've used and makes it hard to balance on your lap. The camera on the body is pointless unless you plan to take photos in tablet mode (don't be that person). The keyboard is fine, but the touchpad is a little cramped. This just comes with the territory on this size device.Basically it does a lot of things adequately and not much more. If you're ok with that, you might like it. For the price, you could get a much better tablet or laptop, but this gives you a little of both.Pros:- USB-C- Screen- Stylus- Size- Build qualityCons:- Speed/responsiveness- Weight (top-heavy screen)- Thickness- Price","Samsung Chromebook Plus V2, 2-in-1, 4GB RAM, 32GB eMMC, 13MP Camera, Chrome OS, 12.2"", 16:10 Aspect Ratio, Light Titan (XE520QAB-K01US)",&299

13,Joanne Wolfe,"June 28, 2019",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice, but buyer beware","The Samsung Chromebook V2 is a super nice product; however, buyers beware that this particular item did NOT have a mobile device chip installed, necessitating my purchasing a $99 Jetpak from Verizon in order to get their unlimited wi-fi plan. I bought the Chromebook to use when traveling extensively in the US and Canada, so I need wi-fi on the device at all times. If you buy the Chromebook from Verizon, it comes with the chip installed. So I ended up paying quite a bit more than I was hoping for given the fact that I initially got a good deal on Amazon. It's not recommended that you use your cellular phone as a wi-fi hot spot for the Chromebook. And I don't have a smart phone anyway, so that was not an option for me. Otherwise, so far I love the Chromebook and would buy it again, for sure. Track pad and touch screen are super responsive  and the keyboard is quite nice as well. Screen has great resolution and sound quality is fair.

17,Kevin Flemming,"May 14, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Almost perfect,"I don't know if there is a perfect device, but I got this in an effort to replace two aging devices:  a first generation chromebook and an android tablet with stylus.  It does the former better than the latter, but if I'm crunched for weight and space, it does the job.  I import music scores from PDF into Squid (Android app) and I can mark them up with the stylus.  A little unwieldy as a tablet, just because it is so big.  It has no direct connection to HDMI, but I bought an inexpensive USB-C adapter and we are in business.  Same for full-size SD cards.  However, it does have one built-in USB 3.0 connection, so you don't need an adapter for USB sticks.Wi-fi performance appears to be a little weak compared to some other devices I have, but has worked okay.","Samsung Chromebook Plus V2, 2-in-1, 4GB RAM, 32GB eMMC, 13MP Camera, Chrome OS, 12.2"", 16:10 Aspect Ratio, Light Titan (XE520QAB-K01US)",&299
18,Dsol303,"November 16, 2021",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the hype. Glitchy and heavy,"I was really excited to try a Chromebook and searched around through many of them before choosing this one. I wanted it for my travels as something smaller that could fit in my purse or bag. Unfortunately during my trip there were many times when I would try to turn it on and it just would not turn on. Or it would be frozen up. And it was brand new. The battery life lasts a long time but what's the point when I can't get it to even turn on or open a program. And although the size was right, or I thought it was, it is actually very heavy for its size. The weight of it in my purse actually made my shoulders hurt where my purse strap was. It's quite hefty. It doesn't seem like it for the first few minutes but as you continue on with it you can really feel its weight. At this size I feel like it's kind of pointless. It's not small enough to easily fit in a purse or small bag, and definitely not light enough. But it's also too small to be a decent laptop for home. Unfortunately by the time I got back from my trip, only having used it a couple times, the return window had closed and so I'm not able to return it. So now I'm stuck with this.

I think this is great if you think of it as a ""tablet plus"" but as a laptop I am disappointed. Not great for work, okay for play.","Samsung Chromebook Plus V2, 2-in-1, 4GB RAM, 32GB eMMC, 13MP Camera, Chrome OS, 12.2"", 16:10 Aspect Ratio, Light Titan (XE520QAB-K01US)",&299
32,Flboy40,"July 27, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best decision I made!,I originally bought this because the last two laptops I had for giving me nothing but trouble. And I saw a lot of reviews when I was looking for a cooling pad that people were buying Chromebooks so I figured I would try it out. I like a Chromebook better than a Windows operating system. Because of the security of the Chromebook now easy it is to use and it flips into a laptop it's quick can I give you a lot of storage. And it's also good because I already used g suit and other Google products. So I will probably be using Chromebook operating system from here on out rather than windows!,"Samsung Chromebook Plus V2, 2-in-1, 4GB RAM, 32GB eMMC, 13MP Camera, Chrome OS, 12.2"", 16:10 Aspect Ratio, Light Titan (XE520QAB-K01US)",&299

I like how the keyboard is attached and can conveniently be used as a stand and a screen protector when it closes. Its 360 degrees fully reversible. Samsung as always allows you to add memory with a micro USB mini card. Very lite weight and convenient to use anywhere. Graphics, pixel resolution, battery life and durability are all amazing with a great price tag that's about the quarter of a macbook.","Samsung Chromebook Plus V2, 2-in-1, 4GB RAM, 32GB eMMC, 13MP Camera, Chrome OS, 12.2"", 16:10 Aspect Ratio, Light Titan (XE520QAB-K01US)",&299

41,sw869,"October 24, 2019",2.0 out of 5 stars,This is NOT a laptop.,"This product works well enough for what it is - but be very clear that it is NOT a laptop. It does not have the functionality of many laptops. I cannot access sites that I need for work with this device (as can my colleagues with real laptops.) I am currently at a conference in Paris, and Chrome is registering the wifi provided by the univerisity here as being unsecure. Chrome refuses to let me log on, (I even tried the usual workarounds. No go) and since the device does not allow Firefox or IE, it basically is functioning like an oversized paperweight. Toggling between porjects is very painful. I tried to make a slide set a few days ago and gave up. Saving directly to Dropbox requires installing a third party application, which seems a little sketchy. If you want a tablet with app-based functionality, this is a great device. I'm frustrated because I wasn't looking for that. I searched amazon for ""laptop"" and I didn't know any better, leading me to buy this device. I just want others to beware.","Samsung Chromebook Plus V2, 2-in-1, 4GB RAM, 32GB eMMC, 13MP Camera, Chrome OS, 12.2"", 16:10 Aspect Ratio, Light Titan (XE520QAB-K01US)",&299
