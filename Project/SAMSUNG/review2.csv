1,Josh,"April 7, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Basic device for basic tasks,"I'm split on this device. On one hand it doesn't have a great screen, it's memory and storage limited, the processor isn't very powerful, and it only has a single standard USB port. On the other hand it is compact, has decent battery life, an alright build quality for a cheap device, has an SD card slot, and does an passable job when it comes to writing, spreadsheets, surfing the web, watching videos, and even light gaming.Chrome OS, on the other hand, seems to struggle with most things. It lacks some of the basic functionality you expect of a modern OS and can be anti-intuitive to use.  It has stability issues with apps, especially ones that compete with Google's own (such as Firefox).Thankfully you can install a basic Linux build for things like Libre Office, but many programs installed that way also seem to have stability issues (like VLC Media Player).The built in media player works but has a terrible interface and limited control, and only the terrible mobile versions of other media players seem to work right. The device has speakers, but they aren't very loud and seem crackly -- thankfully a headphone jack is included.It has no touchscreen and the trackpad is possibly the worst I've ever used, to the point of being frustrating and/or not working the way I want it to -- partly because of the OS, itself, and partly because it doesn't have any buttons or anything available to assist its functionality. A mouse is necessary for comfortable use.The keyboard is alright, comfortable to type on.Honestly, though, if I had the choice to go back and purchase something else I probably would. I'm not sure Google's operating system is for me -- you can't even use the desktop to place shortcuts or folders! I would just get a regular laptop and install Linux Mint on it. Doing so would result in an experience that is far more intuitive, stable, and with the benefit of having access to the functionality of a full fledged OS (and all the programs available for it).At the same time, this will do for most the things I bought it for, just less than expected in some respects.Buy if you want something super basic to write on, look stuff up on, and to keep records. Anything more than that and you should definitely go for something else.","SAMSUNG Galaxy Chromebook 4 11.6-inch 64GB eMMC, 4GB RAM, Gigabit Wi-Fi, Chrome OS, HD Intel Celeron Processor N4000",&233

No storage space, only one USB port and it’s not compatible with ASIO and doesn’t tun any recording app probably.

10,Stacey,"October 19, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Very handy and portable; not perfect,"Pros...I travel quite a lot and was looking for a simple, lightweight chromebook to check email, browse the internet and watch movies on, on the go. This works GREAT for that and I like that the battery life is good enough that I don't need to bring my cord on a one-day trip.The cons..... As others has mentioned, if you are not at the right angle, the screen will be black while you are watching something. That's easy to remedy when sitting, watching a movie alone; but it was very annoying while doing a fitness class via Zoom or watching something with another person. Also Zoom related, I found the camera to be pretty poor, especially in lower light. Final con is that it keeps giving me a message that I have ejected the SD card when I have not.","SAMSUNG Galaxy Chromebook 4 11.6-inch 64GB eMMC, 4GB RAM, Gigabit Wi-Fi, Chrome OS, HD Intel Celeron Processor N4000",&233

13,GMFL,"January 12, 2021",3.0 out of 5 stars,Great Little Chromebook but Be Aware of Limitations,"I'll start with the Cons:Cons: If you have a community internet system at an apartment or condo that requires a password to access the system, you will not be able to get online without jumping through a lot of hoops.  You will need to use another device (smart phone or Windows device) to get the information that explains how to do so, and it is complicated.  Buying a Chromebook is  for the purpose of simplicity and you won't be able to configure your Chromebook until you get past that hurdle.  The other con is that you cannot download the latest version of the Alexa app because it is not compatible with this unit.  If your purpose is to control/configure your smart home or other Alexa connected devices, you can't do it with this particular Chromebook.  If you want to get a Windows based laptop in the same price range, it will be in ""S"" mode, which is great; however, you will need to turn off ""S"" mode to get anything from an app store that is NOT Microsoft and can only use the Edge browser, again, by turning off S mode.  There is a simple way to remove ""S"" mode (which is for security) but once you take it off, you can never put it back on. so be aware.Pros: This is a fine looking, easy to use Chromebook that works as a Chromebook should - fast and easy to understand as long as you don't have the above listed situation.  It does not have a touch screen and the screen resolution is okay for the price point.  If you need this for a home schooled student or for just a quick way to browse the internet and make online purchases, this item is worth the money.  I'm disappointed that it didn't work out for me but in some situations, it will be just fine.  I tested the Chromebook on both a community internet system and a private residential system.","SAMSUNG Galaxy Chromebook 4 11.6-inch 64GB eMMC, 4GB RAM, Gigabit Wi-Fi, Chrome OS, HD Intel Celeron Processor N4000",&233

15,Don,"December 22, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good & fast for my uses,"I'm very satisfied with the quality for the price.  My black Friday pick was sold out but I've been very happy I chose this. No touchscreen but a good quality keyboard and touchpad make up for it. One little quirk: Google assistant only works when plugged in. That's weird and  the only downside I've found.Great quality on my telehealth  visits. Video and camera quality were good and smooth. Sound surprising since there are no visible speakers. Construction quality seems substantial. just what I expected from Samsung. Lightweight, sturdy, battery life of 10+ hours makes this unit fine for me so far. My first Chromebook and I was skeptical of them, but so far, for me, the usefulness. performance and speed for the price makes a great value. Can't find anything to complain about.  5 star happy after 6 months of daily use and I don't give 5 stars lightly.","SAMSUNG Galaxy Chromebook 4 11.6-inch 64GB eMMC, 4GB RAM, Gigabit Wi-Fi, Chrome OS, HD Intel Celeron Processor N4000",&233

17,Tara,"October 4, 2020",3.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product!,"I was absolutely delighted when I received this product. I originally bought it to replace my lenovo laptop that I mistakenly broke. I am a college student, so I wanted a product that could handle loading files and was light weight, making it easier to carry around campus. It came in a day early, and was much tinier then expected, which I am delighted about. Its super lightweight and seems to be running everything just fine. I will update if anything happens.***UPDATE***Okay, so at first I gave this chromebook a 5/5 star rating. However, after a few weeks of using it I have discovered some quirks about the chromebook that I find to be rather irritating as I am a creature of habit. The first one being, there is NO delete button. I don't think this would be a deal breaker at first, but it is slightly annoying. The second one being, whenever I want to write an email, I can't press ""tab"" to indent anymore.  In fact, it seems like I can't do it in any box that I can put text in, such as the box for this review. The third thing, being that you can NOT right click without pressing the ""alt"" tab. Last but not least, there is no way to add apps to the background of this device. The shortcuts are the only way to have apps available. While I understand this isn't necessarily a laptop and that features guaranteed to be different, all four of these issues combined has caused enough irritation for me to write this review. Don't get me wrong, this laptop is great for school. The web camera is wonderful, I don't have any connection issues, but these weird perks are very annoying. Had I known that the chromebooks were designed like that, it would have eased my frustrations getting use to this, or I would have considered getting something else.","SAMSUNG Galaxy Chromebook 4 11.6-inch 64GB eMMC, 4GB RAM, Gigabit Wi-Fi, Chrome OS, HD Intel Celeron Processor N4000",&233
18,Amazon Customer,"July 27, 2020",4.0 out of 5 stars,Product good - service not so much,"This is my first Chromebook. I did alot of inquiring and research prior to purchasing. When it arrived, therse was an issue with getting signed on. After trying myself for a couple of days, I decided to call support. I am pretty sure the gentleman I spoke with has never seen a Chromebook. He had to stop and look up every possible issue and even argued with me at times. One for instance, he told me to find the 2 buttons on the scroll and click the right one. THERE ARE NOT TWO buttons. It is one smooth pad like most laptops have. After an hour of speaking with him, I was getting quite irritated. He finally decided I had to mail it in for service. They sent me a shipping label with an incorrect name and mailing address. I then had to contact them again. The ""supervisor"" stated she would send a corrected label. This NEVER came. Eventually my son came for visit from 2000 miles away and had it fixed in less than 15 minutes. SAMSUNG: PLEASE get some people in your tech support that have a clue.Once signed on, this is a great little machine. I read so many negatives about the poor quality of the screen and I DO NOT see a problem. It is clear and bright.
