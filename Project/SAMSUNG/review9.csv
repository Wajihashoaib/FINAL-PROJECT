0,Tech nerd,"November 13, 2020",5.0 out of 5 stars,Lightest laptop I have ever owned!,"Don't believe the negative reviews! This is a great laptop.The best thing about this laptop is the screen then the weight. The Qled screen is absolutely the best LCD screen on the market with superior brightness, saturation and color accuracy. The 13.3"" size screen in full HD is just beautiful and I believe they have applied an anti-reflective coating on the glass screen. So even though the screen is glossy there is very little refraction. The Ion is the only model with this AR coating. It is very similar to the 13"" macbook pro screen but not as high resolution. In other words unless you have an OLED panel you will not find a better looking screen on any other laptop!!The performance of this device is actually very good but I really think they could have used AMD Ryzen processors with much better results. The i7 this laptop uses is fast but it is not on the newer 10nm architecture which I would have preferred. I would have also preferred 12gb ram as a base for all models. All of that being said this thing is very fast for what it is. My complaints are more about future proofing. For what I use this laptop for it is very fast.Now to the build quality and other features. The build and design of this laptop is one of my favorites of 2020. It has excellent industrial design and minimal bezels. Fit and finish are very good but not perfect. The silver finish is very good at resisting fingerprints. The keyboard is excellent. The glass trackpad is also excellent and can charge your phone!Battery life is also very good. The claims by Samsung are inflated as are all battery life claims on a laptop but what I can say is for an ultra portable the 69 watt hour battery is very large and will get your through a solid day. That is with screen brightness on high, cpu performance set to high.The speakers on this laptop are great and get very loud and have a good amount of bass. You have to get updates for the drivers in samsung update and then adjust the settings in realtek audio console but once you do the sound is amazing. I look at how small this thing is and the sound coming out of it and I am impressed.To wrap it all up this is one of my favorite laptops to use. It is not a speed demon but it can handle it's own, it is super light and portable with great battery life. It does everything I need it to do and has a decent selection of ports including a thunderbolt 3 port. The fit and finish and design are all great. I really like the magnesium build. It does have some flex here and there because it is not using a thick piece of aluminum but a thinner stronger piece of Magnesium. I would just say that you should look for sales. The full retail price is too high IMO but the sale price is a good value considering the features you can only get in this laptop and the competition in the same price range.Samsung has really done an excellent job with it's offerings this year. I am very excited to see what is to come. Just add more ram next time!!",Samsung Galaxy Book Ion 15.6” Laptop| QLED Display and Intel Core i7 Processor | 8GB Memory | 512GB SSD | Long Battery Life and Windows 10 Operating System | (NP950XCJ-K01US),&1291
1,Teacher of Muggles,"August 13, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Lightweight and Functional, Poor Battery Life","I’m amazed at how lightweight this computer is. Almost too lightweight in a sense that I forget it’s in my bag when I’m carrying it. The screen and sound are good. Nothing crazy high quality but good enough to watch a movie when your kids are stealing the three other TVs in the house. I mainly use it for teaching and normal home use and I love everything about it… EXCEPT… one small detail that is turning out to be a big annoyance. The shift key on the right hand side is tiny… I mean smaller than every other keyboard that I have ever used due to the thumbprint key. I wish I could get rid of it in place of a normal size shift key. Overall… I hate to say I wouldn’t buy this computer because of ONE key… but man… there have been many curse words uttered when having to backspace because I missed the shift key in the middle of typing.UPDATE - I have had this computer for a few months now and it’s great. However, my school I teach at has gone virtual and the battery doesn’t last me a full day, not unless on the absolute lowest power settings which isn’t realistic to work on for 8 hours. It’s a big downside if you need to be on your computer without charging it for an extended amount of time.",Samsung Galaxy Book Ion 15.6” Laptop| QLED Display and Intel Core i7 Processor | 8GB Memory | 512GB SSD | Long Battery Life and Windows 10 Operating System | (NP950XCJ-K01US),&1291
2,Alemore,"December 25, 2020",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Beautiful laptop, very light weight with an excellent screen","First of all, I have to say that this is the lightest laptop that I've ever owned. The specs are very good. There are some small quirks that I've had to learn to live with though. First of all, even though I like the fingerprint sensor for logging in, they cut the right shift key in half to place the fingerprint sensor there. I have had to get used to that particular modification since I kept missing the shift key.The shell of the laptop flexes, especially the bottom where the vents are. I feel as if I need to be especially careful not to squeeze the laptop to avoid bending the casing. This hasn't happened so it may be me, but I don't want to tempt fate either.The mouse pad is nice but sensitivity may be a tad high. I often engage the pad with my right palm when using the keyboard. I haven't found a way to throttle down the sensitivity.For a laptop in this class, Samsung chose to include a traditional power plug instead of the newer magnetic type. Bad move by them there. A magnetic type of power cord would be perfectly fitting for this laptop and enhance it's respectability.Ok now, aside from the above, there are so many things that I love about this laptop. The laptop is very light weight. It is beautiful to look at from the outside. The lit keyboard is nice. The screen is absolutely beautiful. The keyboard keys feel good. Aesthetically, this laptop is a winner - no doubt. For that reason, all the things that I don't like are overshadowed by how nice this laptop is. But at the price point, I feel that the quirks should not have been let go so it's only fair to take off one star for overall lack of value.",Samsung Galaxy Book Ion 15.6” Laptop| QLED Display and Intel Core i7 Processor | 8GB Memory | 512GB SSD | Long Battery Life and Windows 10 Operating System | (NP950XCJ-K01US),&1291
3,David,"February 19, 2021",2.0 out of 5 stars,Mediocre product for a premium price,"Samsung Product SupportThe laptop arrived with a faulty pixel. Amazon told me to contact Samsung support. I tried to do that but since I’m in Europe, the Samsung support site would not allow me to contact them through their web forms or chat function (there is no email). The site just kept complaining that I’m in the wrong region. So I contacted the local Samsung Service Centre but they refused to serve the product since it wasn’t bought in Europe. With Samsung you are always in the wrong region it seems.Warranty wise, If you want to travel I would therefore not recommend Samsung products. This is too bad, really, because the laptop would be a pretty good travel companion. It’s very light for its size.The batteryThe battery is one of the best features. It is very good and you can limit charging to 85% in order to preserve battery health.The ScreenI’m quite baffled by the many glowing reviews of this screen. The only really good thing about this screen is the brightness which is quite amazing, but the screen is very reflective so even with that brightness, it can be hard to use it outdoors.There is a lot of back bleeding, and the contrast is really not that good. I’ve used many lcd-screens that are better in that regard (and I’m not talking about oled screens). The lowest brightness setting is also still pretty bright so it’s not great for night use either.The KeyboardThe keyboard is ok, a bit cramped and off-center because of the numpad but ok. The keyboard backlight is very bad however. The automatic brightness detection frequently turns on the brightness even during bright conditions which makes the keys almost impossible to see since they are white. You can manually override the brightness in windows, so it’s only slightly annoying in that case. But in linux you have no control over keyboard backlight so then it becomes more of an issue.The FanIn silent mode, the fan is almost never on and there is no coil whining so it’s dead silent most of the time should you want to use that mode.The touchpadThe touchpad is downright bad. Two finger scrolls are terrible. It frequently fails to activate or it activates the drag function instead. Two finger clicks are also a hit-and-miss affair, with the cursor jumping wildly when you try to use it (also sometimes marking texts in the process). I'm not even that picky when it comes to touchpads, but compared to the last five touchpads I've used (chromebooks and regular Windows laptops) this one is the worst by far and the only one I feel the need to use a regular mouse with.Linux compatibilityLinux works reasonably well, with the only real problem being the lack of control of keyboard backlight (the brightness still works, you just can’t control it). The sound will probably not work out of the gate, but can be fixed if you google the problem.I could not get the fingerprint reader to work either, but that is a minor issue.In conclusionA very bright (but not very good) screen, excellent battery life, light and silent (if you are willing to sacrifice some performance by using silent mode), but otherwise a very mediocre product for a premium price. Samsung after sale support is not very supporting.Update: The laptop got a BIOS (...or EUFI to be correct) update and now the touchpad is working much better. I no longer have any complaints about two finger scrolling and clicking. The touchpad is now perfectly fine, this also holds true for Linux use.",Samsung Galaxy Book Ion 15.6” Laptop| QLED Display and Intel Core i7 Processor | 8GB Memory | 512GB SSD | Long Battery Life and Windows 10 Operating System | (NP950XCJ-K01US),&1291
4,Elad,"March 19, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall solid build and functions, light weight, very fast, with a few minor annoyances","I was astonished at both how light and how fast this unit is compared to my previous Samsung.  The battery life is much longer and charges fast.  The screen is bright and looks good; easy to view.  A minor complaint is the speakers, but I generally don't have them very loud, anyway...it isn't that a big of a deal for me though I don't use it for Zoom or similar activities.  I do a lot of simple games on it, and they function well.  Occasionally after I have opened a game and am engaged in it, it will suddenly flip back to the game selection menu but the active game is on the task bar and opens right up....haven't figured out why it does that.  My biggest complaint is that the fingerprint ID security function is hit and miss whether it works or not; generally I just use my pin to access.  Overall very happy with this purchase.",Samsung Galaxy Book Ion 15.6” Laptop| QLED Display and Intel Core i7 Processor | 8GB Memory | 512GB SSD | Long Battery Life and Windows 10 Operating System | (NP950XCJ-K01US),&1291
5,Sam,"July 15, 2020",5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a real innovation.,"This is my third Samsung Ultrabook laptop since 2013 July.  The reason why I only have used Samsung Ultrabook series is that the laptop is really light. For example, the first generation is about 2.7 LB (it was purchased in 2013 July). The second generation is about 1.8LB (it was purchased in 2018 November). The previous models have some issues (e.g., battery life, display quality, and so on). However, the Galaxy Book Ion (the third generation of Samsung Ultrabook series) overcame all issues. For example, you can operate the laptop without charger about 10 hours.  Also, charging speed is so fast. In addition the touch pad has wireless charger function. The sound quality is so great (Although I have Bose NC-700, Sony WH-1000XM3, and Airpod Pro, I listen a music from the laptop without any headset in my home). I purchased the 15.6 inch for upgrading RAM (13.3 inch may not support ram upgrade). Because the screen is so clear , I believe that the laptop seems to be customized for Prime video, Netflix, and Youtube. Lastly, the design is what I wanted. If you see the surface of this laptop in a different direction, you can see various colors.",Samsung Galaxy Book Ion 15.6” Laptop| QLED Display and Intel Core i7 Processor | 8GB Memory | 512GB SSD | Long Battery Life and Windows 10 Operating System | (NP950XCJ-K01US),&1291
6,SJ Parkinson,"September 22, 2020",5.0 out of 5 stars,Solid Long Lasting Laptop,"This laptop was bought for my wife who spends 4-6 hours a day on it for work and play. One charge is all it takes to be used all day and still have a hefty reserve left. Typical work load is Office Suite, YouTube, FaceBook and Gmail.I formatted the drive and installed Windows 10 Pro myself, but all else is stock. The laptop came with a LOT of Samsung bloatware on the Windows 10 Home edition. Even formatting the entire drive didn't get rid of all of it. However, it is a lot faster and reliable without that crap. Wifi tested around 450 MB/s with a speed test utility.You can wirelessly recharge your phone on the track pad. An excellent feature during hurricane induced power outages or when on an airplane.  She has not complained once about this unit. Solid construction, thin and light weight, it is an excellent all-rounder and recommended.Very happy with this purchase.

9,Rick Riada,"April 17, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,This laptop is the best for me outdoors compared to all of my prior laptops,"It's Outdoor mode rocks a bright screen when I use it in our patio here in Florida. The battery life is great too! I get about 8 hours of use outside before I even start thinking of recharging it. I did months of research to find a laptop that would have a screen brightness value of at least 500 NITs and this one seems to meet or exceed the value as I was only going to buy a laptop that I could use outdoors. If meets my investigative expectations! It has a slot for upgrading the RAM and I will go to 16gb total in a short while. So far, this laptop exceeds my expectations.

10,sara,"January 23, 2021",1.0 out of 5 stars,Light on weight. Heavy on regret.,"With my old laptop failing due to age I spent some time researching available options for replacement. I settled on the Samsung Galaxy Book Ion 15 for a number of reasons. The only shortcomings were the low memory and small drive space. Both of those are upgradeable in the 15"" model so I ordered the upgrades for both at the same time as the laptop.  After opening the case to put in the new upgrades I found that the screw to retain the second NVMe drive wasn't there. Having watched videos of others placing in a new drive in this same laptop as well as seeing pictures of the process I knew this screw was certainly supposed to be there. I contacted Samsung support only to be told my options were to either order the screw from their parts supplier (at my cost) or to send the entire unit in to be serviced.  This laptop is needed to replace a now non functioning laptop used for work. I went 2 days without one while the new laptop was shipped. I can't afford to send the laptop away for who knows how long and simply not get any work done in the meantime. I also shouldn't be expected to pay for the mistakes made at the facility where this laptop was assembled.  To add further insult to injury, I noticed a spot on the screen when there was a light colored background. At first sight I figured it was a speck of dust on the screen or the like. It wouldn't wipe away. It wasn't even on the screen. It's under the screen. It doesn't appear to be a dead pixel. Possibly a bit of dust that got under the glass during assembly? No matter it's cause, it's there. And of course now that I know that it's there, it's all I can see.  So after nearly $1500 into the laptop and it's upgrades I expected to be thrilled with my new work laptop for years to come. Instead, I am left with massive regret for my costly, poor quality purchase that I can't afford to send back. I'm stuck with this.  Samsung quality failed me and their own support department chose to discard a new customer rather than make it right. I expected better.",Samsung Galaxy Book Ion 15.6” Laptop| QLED Display and Intel Core i7 Processor | 8GB Memory | 512GB SSD | Long Battery Life and Windows 10 Operating System | (NP950XCJ-K01US),&1291
11,"Neb, Toronto","May 21, 2021",2.0 out of 5 stars,Laptop stopped working,"It just cannot boot, nothing happens other than the blue status light blinking when I press the power button. Samsung technical support in Canada where I reside claims that the warranty does not cover it here, as it is bought i the USA, although I was positive thee is an international warranty on these devices.After a lengthy exchange with Amazon and Samsung, I learned that international warranty does not exist, i.e. warranty is covered by Samsung only in country where the laptop is sold, but not country it is sold to.Here is Amazon's wording:""As I can see the International Warranty you are talking about is it is not answered by Amazon, that is why we need to reach out to the manufacturer to clarify because usually they are the one who are the one who handle the warranty not Amazon.I also checked the Product Detail Page and I don't see we offered International Shipping, you just saw it on the Q&A section which I confirmed that was answered by a random customer not Amazon nor Samsung"".As far as the laptop is concerned, it has a hardware issue and needs to be repaired, as diagnosed by Samsung US over the phone, so I will have to either pay for it as out-of-warranty repair here in Canada, or ship it to Samsung US, which would be costly and add time.

13,Amazon Customer,"April 25, 2021",1.0 out of 5 stars,Read this review you will thank me later,"pros- bright nice display, cool color change if look at from different angel, can charge some phones using mousepad, cool  charging light indicator on cord, though cord could be longer, fingerprint button  sign in option , cord is small and thin and not bulky, very light can hold it easily in one hand, not hot like most laptops, boots up fast and shuts down fast, keys aren't real loud when typing, cooling fan isn't too loud.cons- speakers way too low  in sound because of the positioning of the speakers which are on the side or bottom it's kind of hard to tell the location but anyway quite low in volume, keyboard not smooth but kind of rough, no good audio software I was hoping samsung would have better software, they just used the standard windows audio package, I got rather spoiled on my old windows 7 samsung which has and still has the best software on a pc ive ever had, the mousepad could be improved as it's sometimes hard to control the mouse control and movement, NO TOUCH SCREEN, this was a big sad point for me cause I LOVE TOUCH SCREEN, this laptop most certainly needs this cause the mouse isn't that great. I can honestly say if the display wasn't so awesome I would have probably sent this laptop back but a good clear, good, bright display is very important to me. Samsung typically has good high quality displays. I just think for the price all the things I mentioned could have been included. I've never bought a laptop this expensive and was wanting more.

44,"Dr. Jerry Parks, National Teacher's Hall of Fame, 2009","June 11, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,“Simply the nicest laptop I’ve ever owned. Period.”,"I currently own six laptops, and have owned Latitudes, Elitebooks, XPS models, Pavilions, Surface Pros, Thinkpads, Envy’s, etc. This is the finest one I’ve ever owned, even though I never imagined buying a Samsung laptop!First off, it’s so very light. Secondly, I’ve never seen, much less owned, a screen so bright and deeply saturated. And when it turns on (about 4 seconds), and you hit F10, the colors go from gorgeous to unbelievable. Yes, the screen brightness is what I love most. And to get that Samsung QLED screen on steroids, well, it is unparalleled in color brightness. The high-end Elitebook with the 1000-nit screen was close, but it had what I call a ‘rolling shadow’ every time the screen was moved forward or backward. Not a flaw, just the way many were made. Not on the ION. Move that lid backward or forward and no ‘shadow’…ever.This bright screen does not hurt the battery much, either. The laptop won’t get 21 hours, but with fine-tuning it will last many hours. As others have noted, the sound is not great, but who really buys a laptop depending on its sound. I also love the tiny lighted (!) AC plug-in to the laptop, and the blazing-fast fingerprint reader is flawless.The 10th Gen. i7 processor just flies. Files copy really fast, and everything moves like it was 2023! Size-wise this thing is THIN. Slips into virtually any purse or protective case as smooth as butter. More than once I thought I was pulling out my iPad.  The keyboard isn’t a Latitude, but it’s a pleasure to use. Brightly lighted too.Small negatives—the fan runs constantly, and the bottom gets pretty warm, even with the roll-under screen edge meant to increase airflow. Also, it’s not as inexpensive as others like it—especially now with a chip shortage. But that’s just the point. The Galaxy ION isn’t like others. It’s QUALITY Samsung-built, and much nicer than the Galaxy Flex. No comparison. And it doesn’t hurt that the reliability of Samsung laptops has moved them up considerably.Again, this is the nicest (and brightest!) laptop I’ve ever owned. And the lightest. I can’t find much about it to complain about. And…it’s beautiful!",Samsung Galaxy Book Ion 15.6” Laptop| QLED Display and Intel Core i7 Processor | 8GB Memory | 512GB SSD | Long Battery Life and Windows 10 Operating System | (NP950XCJ-K01US),&1291
45,Josh,"October 15, 2020",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for basic gaming!,"Pros:+ Extremely lightweight and quiet.+ Supports external graphics (eGPU) via Thunderbolt 3, meaning you have the ability to play modern games (but this will cost $300+ extra).+ Screen is GORGEOUS. Super bright, colorful, and everything you would expect from a Samsung display.+ Battery life is outstanding, but definitely activate battery saver mode and charge to 100% if you plan to be out all day.+ Headphone jack!+ Processor is plenty powerful to even do video editing/rendering with 1080p source material.+ Keyboard/trackpad is a joy to use and type on.Cons:- Track pad charging is finnicky and mostly a gimmick, but could come in handy if you forgot your cable somewhere.- No upgradeability options for the 13"". I would only recommend the 15"" because you can expand RAM/storage down the road.- Upgrading the 15"" is extremely challenging because of the small screws. I stripped mine and had to take it to a computer shop to replace them.- Weak sound speakers. Prepare to use headphones or listen in a quiet place.- No graphics card on the North American version. Asian version gets the MX250 GPU, which would have been nice to have that option.Beware: the Ion does not come with a dedicated graphics card. The onboard graphics (part of the CPU) is, however, fully capable of playing simple or older games (think PS2 or PS3/Xbox 360 era). I am able to play Rainbow Six Vegas 2 at max resolution (1080p) and medium settings at ~30 fps.However, if you want to play anything more recent or intense (like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare), you'll need to get an eGPU, which works well using the Thunderbolt 3 connection. It is an extra thing to carry around when traveling, but at least you have the option to carry/travel light, then play some great games when you are home.I recommend the 15"" version because it gives you the option to increase its internal storage/RAM. The 512 GB SSD goes very quickly. RAM is also very cheap these days, and you can literally double the RAM for only $30. However, if you have no desire to do much beyond watching video, writing e-mail, using Microsoft Office Suite, etc, the 13"" is plenty capable.Final thoughts: I have been a long-time Samsung fan, and I continue to be after buying the 15"" Ion. Any complaints I have are extremely minor and have a way of getting around them. I sold my 2015 desktop computer that I purchased for about the same price, and I wish I started getting into modern laptops sooner. The solid state storage is game-changing, and the laptop is plenty powerful enough to game if you buy an eGPU (I got the Sonnet Breakaway Puck RX 560, which is decent but I plan to upgrade that).Hopes for Samsung to improve the Ion 2.0: advertise it, add customizability options for North America, and include a dedicated GPU. Even if they change nothing else, I would be plenty happy.9/10 :-)",Samsung Galaxy Book Ion 15.6” Laptop| QLED Display and Intel Core i7 Processor | 8GB Memory | 512GB SSD | Long Battery Life and Windows 10 Operating System | (NP950XCJ-K01US),&1291

47,Vedran Simic,"June 18, 2020",4.0 out of 5 stars,Battery life is a lie,"First thing, please do not purchase from Amazon due to price being $200 more then what the item retails at. Bought mine from brick and mortar store for under $1000.Second, the battery that it has advertised as up to 22 hours is a joke. The unit cannot get more than 5-8 hours of conventional use. I do not know what they used to determine the battery life but do not rely on this at all. Performance is okay, even for an i7, it is struggling against the Ryzen 5 4600U processor. Reason how I know is I actually have the ryzen machine and it is doing laps around this machine.Screen does look good. Sometimes too good. Samsung is always known to over saturate the displays on anything they make.  Speakers on the other hand are sort of...mediocre at best. At max volume, the sound sort of sounds hallow, not full and rich. Even though they state that it has been tuned by AKG, this speakers are terrible. I honestly cannot recommend this laptop.",Samsung Galaxy Book Ion 15.6” Laptop| QLED Display and Intel Core i7 Processor | 8GB Memory | 512GB SSD | Long Battery Life and Windows 10 Operating System | (NP950XCJ-K01US),&1291
