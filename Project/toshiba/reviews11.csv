0,Jamie,"December 27, 2013",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just replaced my old macbook, great for daily use & handles the adobe suite like a pro","I have now owned this computer for over six months and can honestly saw what a great, portable and powerful product this device is. It's great for those who want a tablet but don't want the limited operating system. Here you get a full-functioning laptop with a decent sized touch screen (with amazing resolution) that folds down. It is bulky if you're comparing it to a tablet - but considering you're getting a very solid and full-functioning device, I really have no complaints and it's heaps lighter than my old macbook from 5 years ago. And considering it's capabilities, the price is very reasonable.My biggest fear with this device was the exposed screen, but I have no scratches or any sort of wear on the screen and it's super easy to clean. I just use my glasses cloth every couple weeks - as long as your fingers aren't greasy or anything from food or lotion, fingerprints are never really an issue. Back in summer I found the glare on the screen hard to use the computer sometimes in the bright sun, but nothing a shady spot didn't solve!I'll admit, I was skeptical of Windows 8 when it first came out, but I was fortunate enough to have a legit Microsoft employee show me all the features and how to utilize the operating the tile screen. I still am on the desktop 80% of the time, but there are some neat apps and shortcuts you can create on the desktop. It's also pretty fun to customize. But I really have grown to like Windows 8 (so long as you have a touch screen!). I'd recommend just watching some free demo videos and you'll be set. I really love splitting the screen between apps and using the sides to swipe in different functions and menus. It really becomes habitual once you get use to it and now I even go nuts when I'm not on a touch screen!Also, I haven't contracted a single viruses so far and took off Norton first thing (Norton really sucks up a lot of your computers resources, I suggest most people should just thoroughly uninstall it. Though they don't make it easy.) - and that's with being an avid download-er. I actually had a really annoying virus on my mac before that was horrendous to remove, so please don't fall for that myth that only PC's get viruses!The only real downsides I've encountered,-the hard drive has very limited space for my photography & design needs, but I just bought a 1tb passport hard drive with USB3 and I'm set. It is solid state, which really helps make the computer faster and more responsive, but the lack of internal space does bum me out sometimes.-Thought it's not a big deal for me, I know some people like to carry extra batteries and change them if they can't plug in their device. This has a relatively lower batter for today's standards (I can still get a good 4-5+ hours,even while skyping & editing photos) and doesn't allow you to remove your battery. Again, probably not a huge deal for most people, but just a warning to those who do like having back-up batteries.-The only thing my old macbook has going against this device it it's ability to pick up weaker WiFi signals. While it's often not a huge problem, if you're in a weaker WiFi zone, this computer will not want to connect sometimes. Once there is a connection though, it's great. I've mostly only encountered this while trying to access open networks while not in their respected buildings. I probably wouldn't consider this a huge deal, though I've noticed my mac picks up those signals without trouble, but the internet itself does tend to lag a lot.Overall though, I'm soon going back to school and I know I found the perfect device to do my work on and records lectures with (there's two cameras! One facing you and the other on the back of the screen). I carry my computer with me everywhere, so the portability of this device is great. I've had no problems with hardware or software malfunctioning. It's fast, very responsive and surprisingly powerful for it's tiny size! It also has a very slick design that is stunning and tough!I would definitely recommend it for someone wanting a portable, multipurpose device that's got the latest technology while still spending less than a mac! I was initially going to buy a macbook pro but just couldn't make it past the checkout with that price, ultimately I took the lunge and bought this. Never regretted it once. Enjoy!",Toshiba Satellite U925T-S2120 12.5-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Ultrabook (Midnight Brown in Soft Touch Body),$675.00
1,Amazon Customer,"July 26, 2013",5.0 out of 5 stars,Exactly what we were looking for,"Perfect form factor for my wife and I.For the record, I am a fan of Windows 8.  I upgraded my desktop to Windows 8 and had no issues using it.  After using Windows 8 with this machine, I like it even better.  Using this in tablet, laptop and tablet/laptop mode has been a pleasure.I looked and read about many of the new Windows 8 hybrids/tablets.  I really wanted to like the other options, but needed the laptop mode that this unit provides and didn't want to spend north of $1K to meet our needs.  I came across this unit at a local store and was marked (supposedly by mistake) as a similar price as the one on Amazon, but they didn't want to honor their price so I bought it here.I bought this machine primarily for my wife to replace my old HP laptop that died.  I set the machine up using only the touchscreen...didn't even slide out the keyboard.  My wife loves it and I even caught myself picking it up and using it more than her at first.Pros:- Has SSD hard drive.  FAST.  Starts up, sleeps, resumes, starts applications faster than my beast desktop (going to upgrade that to a SSD!)- Cool.  It doesn't get very hot like normal laptops with traditional hard drives (could be the integrated video card as well)- Small and light enough to be portable, yet large enough that we aren't squinting at the screen and wishing for a larger screen.- Battery life.  This machine seems to last a good 4+ hours...haven't consistently timed it, but I don't feel we have to look for the power chord all of the time.  We are able to use the machine, put it to sleep and use it for a couple of days.- Keyboard is backlit- Touchscreen is accurate.  I tried a few touchscreens and walked away from them after just a minute or two because of how frustrating they were.  This one just works.- It has a mouse touchpad that recognizes some gestures...I only played with the pinch zoom in/out so far and just learned that one while writing this review...Give me a break, this is primarily my wife's machine.Cons:- If this is you only machine of the house, the hard drive size in this unit might not be big enough (128 GB).  If you need to develop and need to install a lot of software, this drive would fill up fast.  Also, if you plan on putting your media on this machine, it will definitely fill up fast.- Video Card is probably the minimum you would want in a new machine.  I haven't noticed any particular issue with it, but spec wise it is low- The screen is always visible/exposed (It is Gorilla glass though).  If you need a hybrid that hides the screen when not in use, this is not your machine.- There is no CD/DVD drive...but do you really need one anymore?Overall, just a great machine",Toshiba Satellite U925T-S2120 12.5-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Ultrabook (Midnight Brown in Soft Touch Body),$675.00
2,ECP,"April 25, 2013",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Functionally suits my purposes, so far...","Update 3/14/15: Reading the increasing number of 1-star reviews mentioning touchscreen and screen troubles and outages from ribbon failure or other causes (known and unknown) I feel very lucky now because mine continues to work so well. The included instructions urged slow, careful sliding on the hinge, I recall, and I will continue to change screen positions very slowly and gently, since this design apparently leaves vulnerabilities--or maybe Toshiba's quality-control is spotty as other suggest--or both. But I'm still very happy with mine and it has functioned reliably and adequately, so far. This doesn't feel heavy to me at 3.2 pounds and the relatively short up-to-4-hours battery life (which I knew about before I purchased, so I didn't subtract stars) serves me okay because I'm rarely far from an outlet, but ultraportables are getting lighter and lasting longer and when I buy another I will seek longer battery life and lighter weight.  Those thin buttons on the side are easy for me to feel and operate without having to look and I've gotten used to the smaller, stiffer touchpad too (didn't even try to adjust the settings, just kept working, growing accustomed, but I understand it could frustrate).Original review: Yes, the Touchpad is stiff and the On/Off, Volume and Screen-rotation buttons (on the left side toward the back, as I face the laptop) are tiny, as a reviewer somewhere noted, but these minor inconveniences haven't slowed me down yet. So, I'm unlikely to push any of those buttons inadvertently and the pad works well enough alongside the Touchscreen, which is suitably sensitive.Yes, the Touchscreen is highly shiny and becomes ""fingerprinted""--of course it does--like most tablets I've seen. Wiping it clear (using a lint-free cloth designed to clean eyeglasses) is easy enough.And yes, as tablets go this is rather big and heavy--but it's less awkward than I expected. I hope to take it traveling often.Also, this aside: Yesterday, when I fired this up, was my first-ever hands-on whirl with Windows 8 and I was relieved to realize I could catch on, pretty much, within an hour, though I don't consider myself terribly-techy. The hybrid nature of this little critter and/or Windows 8 must/might be partially behind the double-keyboard effect that distracts occasionally (that I read about somewhere), but I know my confused input, hit-and-missing while learning the new OS and getting used to switching between tablet and laptop modes, caused this weirdness also. Anyway, it's no big deal for me--easy to fix and move on.Right away I found the hinge mechanism sturdy-enough-feeling and pleasantly-surprisingly easy to work during mode-switching.The device is too new for me to rate at 5 stars and this 4-star rating is provisional (I didn't subtract a star just for the slightly stiff Touchpad and buttons or glare or smudge-proneness or any weirdness I've mentioned because that's all minor, in my view, considering my purposes); I'm still exploring the features and testing; and I will update this review with further details, probably.UPDATE February 23, 2015: Finally, I've added the fifth star. I'm still very happy with this and no problems have cropped up thus far.",Toshiba Satellite U925T-S2120 12.5-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Ultrabook (Midnight Brown in Soft Touch Body),$675.00
3,Katy Dorfschmidt,"August 13, 2013",3.0 out of 5 stars,Still deciding,"I ordered this product on the eleventh of July, but didn't receive it until about the eighth of August - so I'm not quite ready for a full review...but here is what I think so far:The computer definitely takes some getting used to.  I was excited to get a machine with Windows 8.  I have a Windows phone and love the interface.  However, the interface on the computer is quite different.  I still haven't figured out several things.  Call me a dumb blonde, but I can't figure out simple things like how to close windows.  Not to mention the multiple hours it took me to figure out how to get to my desktop.  This really is a learning curve though, and I believe that as I learn, the Windows 8 interface could be fun to use.I have had some issues with programs that I typically use - for example, my epub and kindle readers that I use to read books I downloaded from sites such as Smashwords will not work on this computer.  The Kindle Cloud Reader doesn't seem to function the same, and the Kindle app won't import books from external sources as it did on my old machine which ran Windows 7.  This may just be something for me to figure out.I've also had issues getting multiple email addresses to work.  My phone has multiple email icons - one for my hotmail and one for my gmail.  I couldn't get that to work on this machine as it made me use an email address as a ""Microsoft"" email - so now my gmail won't work in an app.  Very confusing.  I ended up having to get a Gmail app through Pokki.  Again, I just need more time to fidget with things.A few other things I've noticed in the few hours I've spent dinking with the machine.  The touch pad is a little tricky to figure out.  Trying to learn how to right click is driving me nuts.  It's pretty touchy.  Also my screen is set to auto brightness, and it can never decide how bright it wants to be.  I know I could switch this feature off - but I like the concept of it.  It just seems to be strobe lighting - it can't find a happy brightness.I will definitely have more to report on after using the computer some more.  This is simply a preliminary review of my initial thoughts.",Toshiba Satellite U925T-S2120 12.5-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Ultrabook (Midnight Brown in Soft Touch Body),$675.00
4,Gary Watson,"December 12, 2013",5.0 out of 5 stars,Does exactly what I was looking for.,"With the myriad of pcs and laptops out there to choose from, deciding which one is good is based on what a person needs. I love this ultrabook. I tried using a tablet ( iPad and the Thrive) before and quickly discovered I'm not a total tablet-person. But, I like the convenience of using a tablet for some things. What I wanted was a combination of both: PC and tablet. I was looking for something I could use on the train during my commute to work without having to lug my 17"" laptop around. I wanted a unit that would be fast, with an Intel processor, large enough screen to make it easy to work on (most of my use is work related, not playing games or flipping around on the internet) with a full keyboard ANd one that would make using the keyboard easy, especially when sitting on the train. With so many options out there for how the keyboard is handled (clamshell, rotating board, softouch cover keyboard combination, etc.) I found this design to be the best. I like that the keyboard slides underneath the screen portion when using it as a tablet rather than having one that is a detachable  or swivel screen, or more so, one where the keyboard flips backward and remains exposed. Unlike some of the reviews I read elsewhere about this unit, the case design is really not an issue. The keyboard does slide out easily making it very easy to use on the train. I have a backlit keyboard on my 17"" laptop and this unit has the same feature. Makes a huge difference when working in low lit areas. The screen is sharp so working on a smaller screen is no problem. It starts up amazingly fast, making it even better to get work done quickly during a train ride. This wasn't intended to be my primary PC or to replace my 17"" laptop, but to be an efficient and lightweight companion to a from work. And, as much as I am a Toshiba fan, I strongly recommend this unit to anyone who has similar criteria in selecting a laptop/tablet combo unit. Less expensive than the Surface, and while some have cited the weight being a consideration, I don't find it to be clumsy or heavy at all. I actually prefer the shape and weight of this to the iPad. Feels much more substantial when using it as a tablet, and I can't stress enough how great it is to be able to switch to using the keyboard in laptop mode by doing nothing more than sliding out the keyboard. You won't go wrong with this unit.",Toshiba Satellite U925T-S2120 12.5-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Ultrabook (Midnight Brown in Soft Touch Body),$675.00
5,Amazon Customer,"June 1, 2013",5.0 out of 5 stars,Laptop is pretty neat,"As far as the laptop goes, I'm really impressed. It's built solid and I'm a fan of the laptop/tablet transformer thing. Backlit keyboard will come in handy I'm sure, and I'm well adjusted to the smaller size of the keyboard too. As far as Windows 8 goes, I wasn't a fan at first but it is growing on me. I don't do the social website stuff, but I'm always on Amazon, eBay, Netflix and stuff like that. The app screen is nice but takes getting acclimated too. But there is also the desktop mode that's easy to get to. I'm big on being able to manipulate my computer to get it how I want it, Win 8 doesn't make that simple but it is doable. I also bought this in anticipation of the Windows 8.1 update coming at the end of the year, so hopefully that will make Win 8 more enjoyable. This laptop is mainly for homework, e-mail, web surfing, and playing movies and it does all these things top notch.Update: 10 February 2014.So I'm about 8 months into the laptop and I was in love with it. I adjusted to the smaller keyboard and windows 8. I felt good about the touchscreen and everything. Then about 10 days ago, the screen would blank (like it just lost all power) when I pulled it into laptop mode. It was perfectly fine as a tablet. I could very slowly push it into laptop mode and it would stay on so I stopped shutting lid to avoid messing with it all the time. Closed it awhile ago to store it and that night the screen wouldn't come back on at all. Had to use hdmi port with my tv and a remote keyboard to work it. Talked with toshiba warranty and had to pay $25 for their shipping box (my choice but they ""Recommend"") so I have the best chance of repair. Depending how this goes will determine my loyalty to toshiba. Too bad.",Toshiba Satellite U925T-S2120 12.5-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Ultrabook (Midnight Brown in Soft Touch Body),$675.00
6,Keichii,"October 5, 2014",1.0 out of 5 stars,First and last Toshiba Product. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.,"Absolute garbage. I am deeply disappointed by the build quality of this device. I chose this over the much better Surface Pro 2 and realize I have made a grave mistake.The keyboard is the worst keyboard i've ever used in my life. The finicky keys do not always register a keystroke because the force from normal typing is not enough for the bottom of the key to touch the contacts. This is especially the case for the space key. There is very little surface force that is transferred to the contact so trying to press the space bar by the edges will simply not work sometimes. Touch typing is very difficult.The battery life is very mediocre. Normal browsing and light media playing gets me up to nearly three hours max. Charging is lengthy and frequent. The fan is very noisy and I cannot even watch videos at a public place without getting strange looks.However, even above this is has to be one of the worst design faults i've ever seen in a laptop. Had this not been an issue, I would've easily overlooked its minor inconveniences. When the computer is converted to tablet mode, the top screen is pushed down and you pull it towards you to cover the keyboard. A small black ribbon is exposed to stress every time you do this. Over the course of a full year, this black ribbon has been slowly robbing my laptop of features. Most notably, after about three months, the touchscreen starting having problems with reactivity and sometimes didn't work at all. Five months in, the touchscreen failed to work at all. I decided to deal with it since I was in a computer-intensive class at the time and didn't have the time or money to get it repaired. Now about a few weeks ago, the integrated mic on the laptop had failed to work, albeit due to the same black ribbon. It does not work unless I angle it at a dangerous and awkward position.I have about a month left on my warranty. I have heard horror stories about particular customer service with this product and I hope I don't have to jump through too many hurdles to get this thing fixed.Three words. Do. Not. Buy. There is much better you can get with your money.",Toshiba Satellite U925T-S2120 12.5-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Ultrabook (Midnight Brown in Soft Touch Body),$675.00
7,Gianfranco Orlando,"June 19, 2013",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great Ultrabook,"I've had this pc for one day and I love it. It is perfect for those users that need something in between for a windows laptop and a tablet.It is fast, processor and internet connection, even with many program opened and running in the background.There are only 2 things so far I don't like:- The HD is quite small. A 250 or 500 GB would have made these ultrabook perfect.- The front camera, with the LCD open has a limited angle because the LCD can not move upward toward the keyboard. This makes video call annoying when you have the unit on your laps as the other person can barely see your entire face.I would have given five stars and + easily if it wasn't for these two things.However, I recommend this PC and I will update this review in case of upcoming issues.",Toshiba Satellite U925T-S2120 12.5-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Ultrabook (Midnight Brown in Soft Touch Body),$675.00
8,E. C. Graham,"September 27, 2013",5.0 out of 5 stars,Not gonna find a better convertible,"I went shopping for a convertible locally and came home empty handed.  From what I could see, convertibles almost always have some pretty big problems in their design.  Lenovo has the Yogabook, but it works by folding the screen all the way over so that the keyboard is exposed and upside down (they sell a case).  The guys at Best Buy says people are having a lot of problems with the hinges on the Dell.  On and on, you get the point.  This Toshiba is pretty sound in my opinion.  Some people aren't going to like that the screen stays exposed, but how is that any different from a tablet?  It has really good features for the money; it is quite noticeable in speed to have a steady state drive.  The technology also works as well as I think anything could work for Windows 8 at this point in Windows 8 development.  I like Windows 8, I don't understand the big knock on it, but maybe that's because having a convertible makes it so much easier to use.",Toshiba Satellite U925T-S2120 12.5-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Ultrabook (Midnight Brown in Soft Touch Body),$675.00
9,Papaw of 1-2-3-4-5-6-?-,"August 23, 2013",4.0 out of 5 stars,Works great.,"Very different from a normal laptop, works great, but not having some type of protection for the screen is a slight draw back.  I used a 3.0 usb external hard drive to install most of my heavy ended programs and it works great.  This allows me to not fill up the 128 gig digital memory.  I also use an Anker 3.o USB docking station.  The entire system runs fast and smooth with two extra monitors (one being a flat screen TV).  Had no problems.  When going portable (unhooked from docking station) it is like having a very large tablet.  This is nice for watching movies, or browsing internet while watching TV.  The back-lit keyboard is really nice.  I recommend it.",Toshiba Satellite U925T-S2120 12.5-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Ultrabook (Midnight Brown in Soft Touch Body),$675.00
10,Mindy Clarke,"May 31, 2015",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Disposable computer, dead within 1.5 years","Disposable computer. I bought this computer 2 years ago. I loved it. Occasionally, the touch screen would not work and I would have to restart. However, just around the 1 year mark, the computer developed Alzheimer's disease and began to forget parts of itself. It started by forgetting that it had speakers and a camera...but only in laptop mode, When you slid the screen closed,the devices appeared again. Then it forgot the touchscreen entirely in both tablet and laptop mode. Essentially, I had a regular laptop computer, which was okay. Toshiba was absolutely no help in trying to resolve the issues and had no explanation for why drivers worked in one mode and not the other. I eventually did a hard reset and the computer's performance tanked. The battery, after 1.5 years, lasted about 1 hour.Now I had a desktop computer. But I still had use for that. Today, however, after less than 2 years, the screen stopped working at all in laptop mode (but still works in tablet mode) and the keyboard doesn't work... since the touchscreen is gone, I have no input method, so this is now a big piece of garbage that I can't even give away because I can't get my personal information off of it. So, if you want something that may or may not meet your needs for the short term and you don't mind losing everything on it, then go ahead and get this computer.",Toshiba Satellite U925T-S2120 12.5-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Ultrabook (Midnight Brown in Soft Touch Body),$675.00
11,Devon Weldon,"March 11, 2015",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not as good as older versions...,"Right out of the box I loved this computer. Windows 8 took a while to get used to, which is not anything specific to this computer. About a month into using it, one day in class the touchscreen just stopped working. I missed out on points because of it. After this recurring multiple times, I realized if I turn the screen off then back on, the touch screen comes back to use. Thankfully. I bought this in the beginning of Sept 2014. Now, March 2015, the screen will not even turn on. Right in the middle of filing my taxes. Spent too long reading through some paperwork and the screen went to sleep. Will not wake up again. Let the battery die, charged it, and tried again. Nothing. All I can get now is the Toshiba start up screen and then blackness. The cursor will move across the screen if you use the mousepad. Very disappointing! My last Satellite I bought about 9 years ago is still kicking! I thought I was making a good choice in this computer! :(As far as the seller, they are awful. This computer was sold to me as new.

It worked well enough to be occasionally useful for a while though. Over time, with windows upgrades and such, the wifi became next to useless and I was getting ready to chuck it. So what the heck, I loaded Ubuntu. It was 10 times better right from the start. Wifi went from iffy on loading google's start page to streaming video with no trouble. I started using it constantly. Sadly, after a few months of this actual use, the display would stop working when I switched from tablet to laptop.

A large tablet when you want a tablet and a competent little laptop when you need it.  This is a real computer that runs excel, word, powerpoint and every other windows program just like a desktop.  The solid state HDD is not big but you can slip in a 128GB SD card to hold files.  This is my second one of these, the first one is still in service after a year of hard use.

Now still under a year the unit touch screen just went out and wont switch landscape ect  And finally wont turn on  Very very displeased  we saved to get this $800 laptop for college and its been a nightmare  I also spent $40 on a very nice hard case padded carrier to protect the uniti -- so Its in pristine condition  just a BAD piece of equipment,Toshiba Satellite U925T-S2120 12.5-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Ultrabook (Midnight Brown in Soft Touch Body),$675.00

24,Amazon Customer,"November 2, 2015",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Cool concept, extremely poor execution.","I bought this about fifteen months ago. At first it worked like a dream, and did everything I wanted. Sleek and light design, fast boot up, can run multiple programs (Word, Excel, Adobe, etc.) at once. But after a while some problems developed. The touch screen would rarely work. Then the screen began flickering. And just today, the display stopped working altogether. I think it has to do with the way the cords in the back move when you flip up the screen; it puts a lot of strain on those cords, and eventually they just give out. I can plug it into another display device and still use my computer, but what's the point if I can't have a laptop? I am extremely disappointed with this product. I took a gamble on something that was different from the competition and it did not pay off.",Toshiba Satellite U925T-S2120 12.5-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Ultrabook (Midnight Brown in Soft Touch Body),$675.00

After my 3rd and FINAL return, they (TOSHIBA) were again of NO assistance whatsoever. Told me that do not do refunds. Thank you AMAZON to the rescue because they were so much more help than Toshiba ever was.Toshiba tech support was (there were maybe 2 that were maybe somewhat helpful - and I talked to quite a few of them believe me!) mediocre and NOT very helpful at all.
