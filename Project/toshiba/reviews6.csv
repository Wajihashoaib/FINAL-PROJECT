0,Ricky,"September 21, 2012",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great bang for the buck!,"I used to be a notebook geek, through and through, and used to write write reviews.  So I'd like to think that I know a thing or two about laptops, but it's been a while, and I'll have to resign myself to the fact that I'm now a common laptop user, and by no means an expert.With that said, I'd still have to say that this is a great purchase.  I recently had to part ways with my trusty Asus EEE PC Netbook, which gave me almost two years of solid, dependable day to day use before showing some signs of being obsolete.  (Yes, seriously.  I used a netbook almost every day for 2 years and did just fine!)  I'm thinking about doing a lot more work on my laptop in my spare time, so I decided to opt for a laptop with a bit more horsepower.  More importantly, I travel a lot for work, and have a corporate laptop as well, so this would be the second laptop I'd carry with me on a plane on a week to week basis.  Thus, I needed something thin, light, and somewhat robust.  After doing what I thought was a reasonable amount of research, and agonizing over all the models I liked in my shopping cart, this Portege was the last one standing.  So far... I'm impressed.  I'll try to make my points a bit more succint:Competitor models that I agonized over:- Asus Zenbooks- MacBook Air- Lenovo U300/U400 seriesWhat I like:- Thin: It's no macbook air, but this laptop along with my 12"" HP work laptop both fit into the one laptop compartment in my laptop bag pretty comfortably.- Light: It's surprisingly light, for it's size.  It LOOKS a lot heavier than it feels.- Battery Life: It keeps fluctuating, but after a few cycles of use, it seems to over somewhere between 6-8 hours, with the lowest screen brightness and moderate internet and word processing usage.  Update - It took about 30 minutes to write this review, and now at 90% it's still saying 7 hours 50 minutes....- Optical drive: I know it's a dying media, but it's handy if you are like me and like burning dvd's/cd's for backups every so often.- Tons of ports: Haven't tried them all yet, but this was a big factor.  I wanted a MacBook air, but hate the idea of having to order extra cables and carry them around, just to use ethernet.  (Yes, I still use ethernet every so often to plug directly into some routers for testing/setup purposes)- Full HDMI and VGA: No mini HDMI, or no adapters needed to get video out, unlike Apple/Asus.- Minimal bloatware: None of the factory installed software has been too annoying or pop up like so far, except for the Norton reminder.  I'm going to uninstall it and install AVG anyway.- Big hard drive: I'm just not somebody that lives in the cloud, and can't make do with a limited size SSD drive.  Fine, SSD is fast, but I don't have huge data transfer needs... just on the go storage needs.- Fast: Everything is functioning pretty snappy right now.  Windows loads quickly, opening the lid resumes it from sleep mode quickly, logging on is fast.  The 4GB of RAM out of the box is just fine for now and will probably need an upgrade in 1-3 years (I hope!).- Keyboard size: Chiclet keys are spaced well enough, to still allow dedicated buttons for home/page up/end etc.- Quiet operation: For average surfing and documentation, the fans stay in fairly quiet mode.  Rendering multiple videos can get the fan to kick in, but it's not overly loud.What I don't like:- Build Quality: It looks nice, but feels cheap.  Super plasticy.  That said, applying pressure to the back of the screen doesn't seem to cause any distortion to the screen- Mouse pad: Clicking sound of the buttons sound plasticy, cheap and hollow.  Also, the mouse pad surface, is more rough than the palm rest.... explain?- No backlight: I know, I know.  It never said there was one, and I knew that when I bought it, but when trying to use it in bed yesterday while my wife was asleep, it was kinda hard to see the function buttons, especially when I've never used it before.- Volume: Volume is modified by pressing the FN + 3 or 4 keys, but no on screen display for volume control.What could be better but I can learn to ignore:- Keyboard: The keys are kind of slippery, and feels weird, but you get used to it.  Sounds a bit clickety clackety, but it's not bad, and you can get used to it.  No issues with mistyping.- Chrome hinges: They look kind of plasticy too, but look ok from a distance.  If you read the reviews, and THIS is your biggest concern, then you might need to rethink what you're looking for.  Also, I think complaints about weak hinges are unfounded.  My screen is holding pretty steady, and I have to give the laptop a good shake to get it to move.- Screen: 1080p videos can be rendered, and look ok, but the screen doesn't POP.  Definitely not a gamer or digital media buff's dream screen, but for day to day use, it does just fine.  I wish it wasn't glossy, but so far I haven't really had any issues with glare.Overall verdict: I really wanted a MacBook air or a zenbook, but at nearly $600 cheaper, the Portege has almost all the same features, and is thicker, but still manages to be incredibly light and somewhat portable.  It's a favourite with PCMag, provides lots of out of the box features, looks good from afar, and is perfectly functional.  My last three laptops have been Asus, and I had some cash to blow on a laptop, but when you compare the Feature to $'s ratio, this laptop clearly comes out on top.  Fully recommended to people who don't nitpick, and just need something that works well, quickly, without breaking the bank.",Toshiba Portégé R835-P94 13.3-Inch Laptop (Magnesium Blue),"$2,333.00"
1,Peter Marinari,"June 10, 2012",2.0 out of 5 stars,Quick computer not suitable for those who work and play hard,"The Toshiba Portege R835-P94 is a Windows laptop that is fine for wireless productivity in your home or on the occasional business trip, but it is not made to stand up to daily wear and tear of a heavy user. It's a pity, because it's a fast, efficient machine.BACKGROUND:I previously owned an indestructible, tiny SamSung NetBook, but after three years of using it 8-12 hours a day the keyboard was finally giving out. I am a HEAVY user, and while I'm not rough on my electronics, they do need to survive constant use and the jostles that come with a daily urban commute. I needed something light, portable, and sturdy that would allow me to be productive ALL DAY and EVERYWHERE - on my couch, riding the subway, walking to meetings at work, at lunch in the city, and between sets with my band.Four months into my purchase and I have many regrets, but depending on how you use a laptop you might not have the same turnoffs as I do.THE GOOD:Right out of the box, the Portege R835-P94 seems as though it is a decent MacBook Air competitor. That's not why I purchased it - I'm not a Mac fan - but when I held it next to my wife's Mac the form factor and weight were a close match, even if this machine is much more plastic-y.This Portege comes right up to the limit of what I consider portable. Any bigger and it just wouldn't work in tight situations like airplanes. While heavier than NetBooks, this machine is still very lightweight for its size.First and foremost, I think the battery life is stellar. On a relatively bright, high-functioning battery setting I can get 6-8 hours. It's rare that I ever run out battery unexpectedly and - if I do - it charges fast.Second, it is quick. It boots quickly, hibernates intelligently, and shuts down in a flash. I used it for a week with the installed RAM for internet, word processing and spreadsheets, video, and minor image manipulation with nary a moment of slowdown. An easily removed panel allowed me to beef up the RAM in two slots - not necessary, but easy to do with ",Toshiba Portégé R835-P94 13.3-Inch Laptop (Magnesium Blue),"$2,333.00"

3,DaveM,"April 13, 2012",2.0 out of 5 stars,Avoid Toshiba computers,"!)The machine is decently ergonomic, with a full-sized keyboard and a slightly off-center track pad with two click buttons. The function keys make sense, and a guide to them overlays onscreen when you press function. I do object to the Page Up and Down buttons being relegated to a vertical row on the side rather than being nested on either side of the up arrow (which is available), but that's a personal preference.The screen is really bright and clear, though it does glare at some angles and on darker content due to its gloss finish. The CD/DVD drive is a lifesaver, and I marvel at how they managed to fit it in.I was relieved to find that the computer has hardly any junk software I associate with most major laptop brands. Aside from standard MicroSoft programs, there's not much of anything pre-loaded. If you haven't used Windows 7 before, it is transparent. It has not once gotten in the way of my daily use, and in some instances of hunting for features or settings I think it is a considerable improvement over XP.THE BAD:Despite all of my likes of this machine, they cannot overcome the fact that the build quality is cheap. Yes, that makes it light, but it's not worth the trade-off!My left hinge fell off within my first day of use. I can push it back on, but it has never fit snugly. The battery locks fell out the first time I set it down sharply on a counter at lunch, and never went back in the same. The hinges are weak, allowing the screen to swing with any small amount of momentum or a strong breeze (I'm not joking!).A few keys are already missing my keystrokes. They just don't depress and rebound fast enough to keep up with my typing - I switch to a desktop to write anything lengthy, which defeats the purpose of having a laptop! Also, the trackpad is beginning to show signs of failure.However, my major complaint is the hard drive. I have had complete hard drive failures within the first 100 days of ownership of every Toshiba product I've bought in the past year, and this laptop was no exception. My old NetBook survived being accidentally punted down a shallow set of stairs and all of the other abuse of three years of daily use. This computer? Three months and a dead HD, right in the middle of my work day - no punts! I replaced it with a Solid State ",Toshiba Portégé R835-P94 13.3-Inch Laptop (Magnesium Blue),"$2,333.00"
4,Dave D,"September 11, 2012",2.0 out of 5 stars,Computer problem - bad support,", which I recommend doing RIGHT AWAY if you decide to purchase it. It was as easy to install as RAM, and it only took about two hours to load the factory settings from backup DVDs (which you have to make yourself or order for an additional fee).This machine can be loud. Not at rest - the fan is audible, but not annoyingly so. I read other reviews stating the mouse buttons were loud. This seemed like a trivial complaint to me, but they really are! No matter how gently you click, they make an obnoxiously loud KERTHUNK. The chicklet style keys are also rather clacky, and extremely squeaky since day one (even with a dab of WD-40). The DVD drive is incredibly loud - I think prohibitively so if you plan to watch anything. Also, the computer weirdly emits a loud chirp every so often - I assumed this was the hard drive, but it continues to do so even with the SSHD installed.Another minor complaint - there is no on-screen overlay when you raise or lower the volume with function keys. I thought for sure something was broken until I Googled it! The sound is decent for a laptop - loud, but no bottom end.Finally, while glossy finishes make for attractive electronics, they also mean you are constantly wiping away dirt and smears. It's no big deal, but if you are the kind of person who needs your electronics to look elegant and spotless this might not work for you. The screen shows smudges very quickly, so keep a microfiber cloth handy in your case.BOTTOM LINE:This laptop is probably heaven sent for lighter users who simply want something that will keep them surfing and productive when they need a connection. If that's what you want, I cautiously recommend it - though, I do endorse springing for the solid-state HD.My complaints are those of someone who LIVES on a laptop. It's where I work, play, and create. If you're like me - who uses a machine morning until night, who juggles it between meetings and writes thousands of words a day - the Portege is just not ready for the task. You'll be shedding plastic pieces, wincing at the loud and squeaky keys, and praying the HD doesn't fail between cloud backups.I can tell this is not going to last three years - it has already broken in at least three ways in four months! If you are looking for a daily use laptop, please use caution (and back up your data)!",Toshiba Portégé R835-P94 13.3-Inch Laptop (Magnesium Blue),"$2,333.00"
5,Alex Papadimoulis,"August 29, 2012",5.0 out of 5 stars,A Wonderful Almost-Ultrabook,"If you want a compact and lightweight laptop that doesn't compromise on functionality and still looks great (and doesn't cost an arm and a leg), then this one's for you. I've been carrying around a 15.5"" Sony Vaio for the past 2.5 years--don't get me wrong, I love that chunker--but it got pretty beat up, the battery life was absolutely horrible, and I dreaded having to lug it around in my backpack all day for classes (I'm a full-time college student). So I started looking for a replacement. Buying the Toshiba Portege R835-P94 was one of the best choices I've made in purchasing technology. Here's my breakdown of the pros and cons:Pros.1. It only weighs 3 pounds! I can do curls with it on my weak arm for ten minutes and not feel a thing. (well, maybe that's exaggerating, but it's ridiculously light!)2. It's gorgeous. The exterior looks black in low light, but every once in a while I'll catch a glimpse of that ""magnesium blue,"" and it makes me happy. Not to mention the slight texturing on the cover makes it look even better.3. The thing fits into my purse. It's nice not to have to take my backpack somewhere just because I'm bringing my laptop.4. Battery life! I haven't actually sat down and timed how long it can last, but I do know I can watch a 2-hour-long movie, an episode of The Office, and work on a paper (all in high brightness and volume) and still have a solid 40% left. I can't even describe how wonderful it is to take it out for the day, use it during classes and in the student center, and not have to take the power cord with me. It's fantastic.5. The touchpad. My Vaio didn't have multitouch, and it had some funny texturing on the touchpad. But this Toshiba's touchpad is glorious. It's smooth and super convenient, and it doesn't jump at all when you try to move the mouse.6. Speed. It's very fast--I haven't had any issues whatsoever with trying to download things or access ""busy"" web pages.Cons.1. Smudges and fingerprints. Because the laptop's a darker color, dust and oils show up on the keys and cover a lot easier than they do on a lighter shade. But of course you can clean it off regularly if that bothers you. It's definitely not worth passing up this baby for.2. Microphone placement. I like to Skype with friends and family, and I was a little annoyed to find out that the microphone is located on the front right corner of the laptop base right next to the SD slot. It's easy to forget it's there and accidentally rub over it with my wrist when I'm multitasking with working on a project and Skyping, because then the noise kills whoever I'm talking to. Not a great idea to put that there.3. Speakers. They do their job, but I can tell the difference between these speakers and my Vaio's. These just sound kind of hollow, and the quality's not fantastic. But hey, they work.So, yeah. That's what I have to say about the Toshiba Portege R835-P94. All in all, I think it's a fantastic laptop for the price. I'm very happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend this laptop to anyone!",Toshiba Portégé R835-P94 13.3-Inch Laptop (Magnesium Blue),"$2,333.00"
6,Ken McWilliams,"March 8, 2012",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good laptop & value,"Update as of May, 2015. The thing is about shot. Very disappointed with service life. Crashes frequently. DVD player no longer works. Next computer will not be a Toshiba.Update as of Dec/2012- I am not as happy as I was with this purchase, but still consider it to be a good value in this product area.Reasons for lowering my initial review:1. Fan runs almost continuously. This has gotten to be an area of huge annoyance for me. I havent really tracked this from the beginning, but one day a few months back I was working and noticed the fan never really stopped. Now, of course I notice it all the time. Had I known this was going to happen, I probably wouldnt have bought this computer.2. Battery life has dropped significantly over time. I would say it's down 40% from when I first started using it.Bottom-line- if you are really using the computer to work,like I do, you might keep on looking, and the fan noise will drive you nuts eventually.Do still love the low weight though!Update as of 04/20/2012-  still extremely pleased with this computer. The Bluetooth was really easy to install and found my cell phone the first time (I have had trouble with other computers). Bluetoothed serveral pix and found the transfer was faster than normal.I have had this computer for a week now. So far I am really happy. It is very light (I have to carry two LT's)and it fits well in my backpack. The battery life is excellent. I have used it on battery for about 5 hours and it was down to about 1/3 charge when I plugged in.I also liked the fact I could delete some of the factory installed software-completely. I get sick of all the pop-ups begging you to activate their software. I have had computers where this was impossible (for the average user) and had to live with these popups.There is not a lot else to say. I am a 'light"" computer user (no gaming, or high tech uses) The applications I do run (MS) open quickly so,  plenty of memory (4-GB) and the 640 GB hard drive will store all my picures and videos. As I said, I travel a lot and take pix and videos as mementos.I recommend this PC to anybody who travels a lot and needs a personal PC to take with them. It is an excellent value for money!One note- if you get one, also buy a padded sleeve to protect it. Being so thin means it is fairly fragile and evidently (reading other reviews Toshiba is pretty firm on their 'damage' policy- if you break the screen you might as well throw this one away as the screen replacement will cost as much as new computer. just take care of it and you shouldnt have any trouble)Good luck!",Toshiba Portégé R835-P94 13.3-Inch Laptop (Magnesium Blue),"$2,333.00"
7,Ronulus,"June 27, 2012",5.0 out of 5 stars,FIRST DAY OUT OF BOX...FREEZES OUT OF HIBERNATION,"After purchasing this laptop for my daugher for college, at first we were quite happy with it.  She used it for about two months.  However, just a few weeks before school was to start, it developed a problem wherein the computer would shut off when disconnected from charger - as if there was no battery at all, even though it showed 100% and charging.  When talking to a support person, it was concluded that I would have to return the computer to them for repair.  They told me it would be in the ""Depot"" for 7-10 business days.  I explained the need to have it back quickly because of college starting.  It fell on deaf ears, because he said it will still be the standard 7-10 days. They sent shipping materials and it was sent back the same day. Well, it will soon be a month now, and their repair status page showed that the repair was completed, and that it was being prepared for shipping.  After hearing and receiving nothing, checking back on the status page showed that the computer was back in repair again.  There is no way of contacting them about the repair, either by telephone or by email. All they do after several telephone prompts is refer me back to the repair status page.  I will never again purchase another Toshiba product.  Buyer beware... if you have a problem, don't rely on Toshiba to fix it.  My daughter has been at college now for two+ weeks, and without a computer thanks to Toshiba.  Who knows how much longer it will be.By way of update... after contacting Toshiba by way of their website feedback (the only way I could find to send them a message), they did respond and informed me that the computer did not pass the testing phase and had to be sent back to repair - and they were waiting on parts.  This is the kind of thing they need to keep their customers ""in the loop"" about, but failed to do so.  A lady there named Julie personally looked into my case, and I think sped things along.  Bottom line is that the computer was returned in good working order.  From the day I shipped it to Toshiba until the day I had it back was 1 month and 1 day.",Toshiba Portégé R835-P94 13.3-Inch Laptop (Magnesium Blue),"$2,333.00"
8,BGS,"May 29, 2012",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Computer....Great Value,"I had been doing the desktop *and* laptop thing for about 5 years now, the idea being that a laptop was just not a suitable replacement. And then someone told me about the Ultrabooks. Wow. Highly portable, grown-up computers (as opposed to the toy netbooks) with a crazy battery life. For real?But the more I looked into Ultrabooks, the less I liked: * I want real, full-sized ports. VGA, HDMI, Ethernet. I don't have time for adapters, and I don't want to be that jerk who goes around trying to borrow someone's adapter. No one likes that guy. * I like a removable battery. Maybe I'll want to buy a spare, or a giant aftermarket protuding battery that I won't need. I want options. * I don't want to carry around or have to borrow an optical drive. The world isn't all USB Thumbdrives, don't kid yourself. It's an extra expense and you'll just end up carrying it with you when you travel. And again, you'll be the jerk without the optical drive. * I don't need fancy-pants beveling and sleek looks. I don't have time for that, either. I spent all my fancy-pants time writing this review.So then I found this computer, which is an almost-ultrabook. I bought a 128GB SSD, 8GB upgrade, a USB3.0 Dock, a spare adapter for home, and BAM, now my life is even more awesome. I even got a man-purse/satchel that I carry it around it.Few other points...I did the fresh Windows 7 Pro thing, and found it was a little bit of a hassle finding the drivers, but it almost always is (especially on newer computers that haven't made it to Windows Update yet), so no points loss for that. It's the price you pay for no bloatware.The small screen and keyboard took a little getting used to, but it's fine. I have a keyboard/dock/mouse at work, and use it at home, planes, hotels, etc. with sometimes a mouse. Works fine.",Toshiba Portégé R835-P94 13.3-Inch Laptop (Magnesium Blue),"$2,333.00"
9,Dennis Berthold,"June 14, 2012",5.0 out of 5 stars,Incredible Value and Functionality,"I haven't had this one very long, but after installing some high end programs (Adobe CS-5 suite, Corel Draw X5, Video Studio pro, and MS Office) and running them, I am very pleased with the results. No problems at all installing or running the programs. I loaded and edited eight high res photos in Photoshop with no problems. The small screen doesn't give me the view or capabilities of my 25"" monitor & desktop computer, and I would not like to do any serious graphic design work on the Toshiba, but for what it was intended for, it does very well.If you would like to see more reviews on the Toshiba R835-P94, look at the Toshiba R835-P81, it is the same computer except the P94 also has Bluetooth and is over $100 cheaper. The P94 is an Amazon exclusive, which probably accounts for the lower price. The P81 comes with 6 GB of ram while the P94 only has 4 GB. The 4 GB of ram is fine for most applications and most users, but I like to max-out my ram. I bought two 4 GB high speed ram modules (a total of 8 GBs) for $46 and the P94 is noticeably faster. Installation of the ram is very easy.A real shocker was discovering that the battery power lasts almost as long as advertised. Amazing! I have never had a laptop that even came close to this one.I'm not a ""gamer"" so I can't speak to its capabilities in that arena, but I have watched streaming movies, and DVD's with no problems. The only negative things that I have noticed so far are that it has a narrow vertical viewing angle. I'm comparing it to my old Sony Vaio which has a larger and very good screen. The other negative is the ton of bloat ware programs that Toshiba loads on the computer. I doubt that you will ever use the majority of them. Sadly, it seems that all of the manufacturers are doing this now.Overall, the Toshiba R835-P94 is very good computer for the price.

It whites out all of the text and the colors don't show up normally. I have to switch between the balanced and eco setting a few times to get the color and lighting to come back to a normal look again. I have yet to figure out if this happens when I'm in the balanced setting or the eco setting, or even both. Either way, it's not a big deal because it's easy enough to push down the FN button and F2 several times to rebalance the lighting.Overall, I would recommend this laptop. It's a good price, and besides that weird lighting thing, the rest of the specs are just what I wanted and the laptop works great.",Toshiba Portégé R835-P94 13.3-Inch Laptop (Magnesium Blue),"$2,333.00"

Great price!Cons:  The hard drive & fan are a bit loud at times. The CD drive is so loud & vibrates when there's a cd in there that I have to hold my hand on the computer while its running to quiet the noise.

Worked great in all regards, battery life is super, quick for all Office Pro and Photoshop/Premier Elements use. Bluetooth & WiFi connections no problems either, and good sized hard drive too - the 2000+ pics & videos we took didn't put a dent in it.Was concerned that the screen might be too small as I was used to a 17"" laptop and desktop screen size, but not a prob at all for me.Only downsides were the glossy screen which I knew about going in and the chiclet keyboard which I did not.Only thing I would have liked was a backlit keyboard because I did use it at night and my touch-typing hadn't come up to speed with the chiclet keys, but this had everything else at a good price.",Toshiba Portégé R835-P94 13.3-Inch Laptop (Magnesium Blue),"$2,333.00"

This the Portege R835-P94 is by far the best of the group I've owned.  I was a little disgruntled by PRIME screwing up the next-day shipping, but I will get over it. All small notebooks have lousy sound without external headsets, but the bluetooth in this unit makes my Motorola S9 work great. I have replaced the 640GB HDD with a 256GB SDD, and upped the memory to 8GB. I really like the face recognition software...though I'm glad I can still remember my password.  Other pros: very light, very sleek, and I love the 9-hour battery.  YES, it really does last up to 9 hours, which is good when I have so many meetings I take it to.

My mother and best friend have the same one but a year older.  I'm really glad I chose this one.  The battery life is phenomenal, it's extremely light weight, and the CD drive is very convenient.  Though by no means am I a tech person, I can say that I do a little light gaming on this laptop, and that it has worked really well for me through everything.  It's a pretty speedy little workhorse, even loaded with pictures, music, and games.I did recently upgrade it to have full ram, but I've had this for several months as it came in the box and it worked just fine straight from the factory.  I did clear out some of the initial programs that came with the laptop, like the default antivirus software and some of the on board game applications that I have no interest in.",Toshiba Portégé R835-P94 13.3-Inch Laptop (Magnesium Blue),"$2,333.00"
16,Richard C. Yeh,"November 6, 2013",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best laptop I have ever owned,"This is the best laptop I have ever owned. I can easily get 8 hours of battery life in normal internet use. The laptop is little more than 3 pounds. The keyboard isn't cramped. The processor is fast when it needs to be; and the laptop doesn't run hot. My wife adopted it immediately and gave me her 5-year-old pentium dual-core 6-pounder with 1 hour of battery life.The only issue we ever found was that sometimes when the screen brightness changes (due to power-saving settings), the display becomes fuzzy for a little while.  I'm not sure whether there is a different optimal pixel configuration at different brightness settings, and something is out of sync.  The fuzziness disappears after a minute or so.With a laptop like this, there is no reason ever to buy a netbook. In our use, having this laptop also makes it hard to justify buying a tablet.",Toshiba Portégé R835-P94 13.3-Inch Laptop (Magnesium Blue),"$2,333.00"
17,Yee Min,"May 26, 2012",3.0 out of 5 stars,Wish Toshiba improved the keyboard,"I was excited when the package arrived, but I have been somewhat disappointed with some aspects of the Protege R835. Let's start with the good stuff:1. Extremely portable. It is really light for all the features available.2. Good screen size and sharp display.3. Touch mouse is responsive.4. The cold boot and the warm boot (from its sleep mode) is fast.Definitely need improvement:1. Keyboard was a big downer. It definitely require improvement. It needs a lot of energy to type. Considering that this was the main input device, this was disappointing.2. The screen is not a matte surface. When you turn it on, you can see your reflection. I personally like matte display. Having said that, when the display is on, you see very little reflection.Overall, because of my keyboard experience, I can only rate 3/5.",Toshiba Portégé R835-P94 13.3-Inch Laptop (Magnesium Blue),"$2,333.00"

My employer has used Toshiba laptops for years and they have been excellent devices.  I boutht this one for my wife after having a slightly older model of the Protege series for some time.  Laptop is fast, graphics are crisp, laptop is light, and most of all, dependable.  My only complaint is that the speakers on this laptop are not that great.  So it depends on what you are buying it for. If you want a powerful and dependent laptop that will last you a while, I will always recommend Toshiba.  There are different laptop lines though so if you are looking for certain features, be sure you are looking at the Satellite, Tecra, etc. etc. so you get what you are looking for.

Even after optimizing the display it is just ""fuzzy."" I just went to burn a dvd and it sounded like the dvd drive was going to fly right out of it. I actually held my hand on it to ""hold it down.""I think that if you need a small laptop to keep safe at home it would be OK. No way would I consider this a backpack worthy computer.

This may cause the screen to crack if a pressure applies to screen when lid is closed. Basically if you carry your laptop in your bag, screen may crack because it may bend.Maybe mine was defective or it is designed like that, but I was expecting an ""even"" fit when I close the lid.Before you buy check the stores to see if your comfortable with overall look and and design.",Toshiba Portégé R835-P94 13.3-Inch Laptop (Magnesium Blue),"$2,333.00"

I am about to go through the repair process and I am cringing after reading another review here about month long repair time.Update.  Needed to send back for repairs, but my kid needed another computer fast. Figuring that this was a fluke, I was enough of a fool to buy the same thing again overnight from Amazon.  It is already making a horrible noise when a CD-ROM is put in the drive, which doesn't bode well.  Can't do anything until the first junker comes back from repairs, but I may have to ask Amazon to step up to the plate this time.Such a shame, Toshiba used to make great laptops, but the quality of this model is shameful.",Toshiba Portégé R835-P94 13.3-Inch Laptop (Magnesium Blue),"$2,333.00"
