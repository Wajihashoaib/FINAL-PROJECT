5,Mercedes Rochelle,"September 7, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful display,"When I opened the box I was horrified that it didn't contain a Toshiba. My old laptop lasted eight years without a glitch, though it's finally starting to fail. I wanted another Toshiba, though I didn't realize that Toshiba had been sold to Spark in 2018—hence the Dynabook. Once I got over my disappointment, I was very impressed by the quality of the monitor. It is sharp and brilliant. The keyboard is full sized, though the number buttons are a little narrower. The keys are all in the same place and you can click anywhere on the keypad to ""enter"". For some reason, the place where I put my hands is more comfortable than I am used to. Happily, it still contains a DVD player. It has 3 regular USB ports and one USB-C connector, only one jack for sound (when I plugged in my speakers it deactivated the microphone), the HDMI and Cat-5 connector. I was surprised at how small the Hard Drive was... only 256 GB. But the processing speed is more than acceptable and I don't save a lot of photos. I'm quite content with this machine.","2022 Latest Toshiba Dynabook Satellite Pro L50-G 15.6"" FHD (Intel Quad Core i7-10510U, 16GB RAM, 512GB PCIe SSD, NVIDIA MX250 2GB Graphics) Full HD Business Laptop, Webcam, Windows 10 Pro",$899.99
