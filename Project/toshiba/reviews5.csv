0,angelflower,"November 16, 2015",3.0 out of 5 stars,So-so.  Not worth the price,I read the reviews before ordering this item and noted that reviewers mentioned two things that I found concerning:  the mouse pad issues and the sharp edge of the computer.  Let me start by saying I am a loyal customer to Toshiba.  This is my 3rd Toshiba laptop - I loved my last two.  This one feels cheaper and not up to the standards of my last Toshiba laptops.  The issue with the mouse is SUPER IRRITATING!  It's happened three times while just typing these few sentences.  Basically you are typing along and suddenly you realize that the cursor has jumped and highlighted what you are typing and it is deleted.  If you buy this computer you will use CTRL-Z a lot!  The sharp corners are annoying but you can learn to hold your hands differently and then you won't get cut.  If you rest your wrists on the edge of the laptop you will have a sharp red indent in your skin quickly.  The big thing on top of these has really nothing to do with the hardware - it's the software - windows 10.  It proved to be a lot of work to get this computer set up and remove all the crappy software it comes with (windows 10 related).  Would I buy this computer again?  No.  Should you?  Just be aware of the mouse and edge issues. I haven't loaded a lot of other software on this computer - it seems slow often and does freeze up a lot.  If you can wait - wait on a new laptop with windows 10 until they iron more kinks out.  So overall - this is just an okay laptop.  If I had pad half the price of what I paid I might be happier.  It's just not worth the price in my opinion.,"Toshiba Satellite S55-C5274 15.6 Inch Laptop (Intel Core i7-5500U 2.4 GHz, 12GB DDR3L-SDRAM, 1TB HDD, Windows 10 Home 64-bit)",$499.95l
1,Nicholas L.,"April 9, 2017",2.0 out of 5 stars,Underwhelming performance with overwhelming fan noise,"This is my 3rd toshiba laptop and I was a totally loyal toshiba customer until I bought this laptop. It is slower than my ~3 year old toshiba w/ an i3 that I bought at staples for $429. First thing I noticed was that this is absolutely the loudest laptop I've ever used! The fan roars like an airplane trying to take off, I tried adjusting power settings and following other solutions described by others who had the same problem, and it does help, but makes the computer slow. Next, within a few months, the audio jack stopped working and I had to buy a usb adapter. Yes, the sharp corners are not people friendly, If I lay in bed with the laptop propped up on my chest, I have to put a pillow on my chest so the laptop doesn't cut into my chest. This wasn't an issue with my previous laptops. The display is better than my old laptop, but I wouldn't say it's good by any stretch. Overall I'm pretty disappointed with this machine for the price, I thought I was getting an upgrade over my old laptop, but it just doesn't feel that way. I plan to dig into ways to optimize the performance of this laptop, but haven't gotten that far yet, and I don't think I should need to do that for something as expensive as this machine.","Toshiba Satellite S55-C5274 15.6 Inch Laptop (Intel Core i7-5500U 2.4 GHz, 12GB DDR3L-SDRAM, 1TB HDD, Windows 10 Home 64-bit)",$499.95l

26,JT,"October 17, 2015",3.0 out of 5 stars,High value i-7 laptop with serious BIG flaws,"I bought this machine from Staples for $600 after rebates. This is my third Toshiba laptop in the last two years. The first one was the S50 i7 based, so I thought this one is at least better than the two years old S50. But I was not happy with this purchase after two week using it. Here is the summary:The GOODs:1. 12 GB of RAM: plenty for any use2. 1 TB of Hard Drive3. Bluetooth4. Back-lit keyboard (worth $20 upgrade)5. Better battery life (But come with performance downgrade)6. Windows 10 preloadedThe BADs:1. i7-5500u only has two cores: its performance is probably equivalent to the older generation i3 dual core processor. Noticeably worse than older i-7 quad core. This is one BIG disappointment for me: I did not do research on this new Intel processor family for laptop; trade off performance for battery life2. Materials and feel seem cheap; The sharp four corner edges are nightmareThe UGLYs:1. The fan is running all the time. And worst yet, it is VERY LOUD. To keep it down, it had to go to BIOS power control and turn off the Dynamic clock and the Turbo clock. After that, this laptop is quieter but rums VERY VERY slow: probably slower than my one year old dual core i3","Toshiba Satellite S55-C5274 15.6 Inch Laptop (Intel Core i7-5500U 2.4 GHz, 12GB DDR3L-SDRAM, 1TB HDD, Windows 10 Home 64-bit)",$499.95l
27,Natasha,"February 16, 2017",2.0 out of 5 stars,meh.,"This computer does what you need it to do for the most part. I got this as a gift for Christmas in 2015 It is February of 2017, so it is a little over a year old now, and I am having a lot of issues with it. It never wants to connect to the internet. I have excellent signal strengths and I can have my Wii U running Netflix with absolutely no problems but this computer will not connect to the internet. It isn't consistent, either. I always get up and do the whole unplug/plug back in your router, which doesn't do anything! Eventually, I will give up and just use my phone and hope that it will connect again. (Thank goodness for google docs and drive!) The trackpad buttons click obnoxiously and feel incredibly flimsy. The edges of the laptop are pointy and sharp at times. The lid isn't the prettiest, but I think they are trying to imitate mac at some level; their computers always have a classic look after all. The lid gets scratched easily and I 100% hate the little letters on the lid!! They get caught in your laptop bag (if you have one). The silver letters will fall off and leave little black rubber stopper things. I was worried that something would pop that little rubber stopper off, so I covered it with a sticker. I am not a fan of stickers on laptops either, so I wasn't happy with that. On top of all of the other issues, the battery has decided to start breaking. I keep it on the charger all night so I have a nice charge for school and work, but it is always at 80% battery life even though it was on the charger all night. The battery has been draining faster, forcing me to carry the charger with me. While I was in class today I put it on the charger since it all of a sudden had 20% battery life; I got off work and went to my classes, which start at 1 pm and by 2 pm it was at 50% by 2:30 I was at 20%. So, something is obviously up with the battery. Anyways, when I connected it to the charger I got a message saying it cannot be charged. I got fed up and just shut the laptop at that point. I needed to show something to my professor, which I typed on Word not google docs due to my school's online system only being compatible with Word documents, and I had 80% again, this was at 2:45-2:50. Yes, the computer has a nice hard drive and powerful processor and all that, but I have found that it isn't worth the price. Spend the extra and get a mac or get one under  $500 that will be more reliable. This one replaced a laptop I got at Walmart for $250 and they gave me a $50 gift card for buying that laptop. It lasted 4 years! Price doesn't always equal quality material. If you need a computer for school related stuff, either as a student or a teacher, go for something else. I am not the best person with technology but I can manage okay on my own and this computer just isn't the best it could be for the price.","Toshiba Satellite S55-C5274 15.6 Inch Laptop (Intel Core i7-5500U 2.4 GHz, 12GB DDR3L-SDRAM, 1TB HDD, Windows 10 Home 64-bit)",$499.95l

30,Amazon Customer,"January 13, 2016",4.0 out of 5 stars,Toshiba vs HP vs Samsung.,"After 4 years of using the Samsung laptop I purchased to use for college (at age 50), it literally caught fire on my lap. As such, I had to run to Staples on December 27, 2015 for some type of replacement. For $570.00 After rebates, I bought the HP 15T Notebook, It lasted exactly 3 days, on December 30th about 10PM is started flashing a bright blue screen and failed completely. Thankfully, Staples has a no nonsense 14 day return policy as I called HP support, and he informed me for a total of $94.00 he would repair the computer remotely. I explained it was 3 days old and The HP SUPPORT EMPLOYEE again told me it would be $94.00, only this time gave me an option, pay him or take it back to the store. I had taken the unit back to Staples, they gave me another of the same model, it lasted exactly 9 days and failed completely. Again, Staples had accepted the laptop back, and there was NO WAY I was taking another HP home with me. As such, I purchased the Toshiba Satellite 5274 and LOVE IT at this point. I am NOT a Gamer etc, I do NOT edit photos either. I do however, write College and Professional papers etc. This unit seems to run far faster than the HP's and is much better quality in my opinion. The Toshiba was 160.00 more than the HP, but believe me, the piece of mind that come with knowing I will not again lose another 22 page research paper makes the additional cost worth every penny.  This Toshiba is a good unit. I have been advised to steer clear of the basic entry level Toshiba's as they are having a dramatic issue with wireless convertibility. If I had access to another Samsung, the exact model that actually caught fire on my lap, I would have bought another one of those in a hot minute even with the out dated technology, that Samsung NEVER FAILED ME ONE TIME IN 4 years of college abuse.","Toshiba Satellite S55-C5274 15.6 Inch Laptop (Intel Core i7-5500U 2.4 GHz, 12GB DDR3L-SDRAM, 1TB HDD, Windows 10 Home 64-bit)",$499.95l
31,Brian from Northern California,"October 14, 2015",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great performance for the price,"Bought this for my son who is pursuing engineering and wanted a laptop that could keep up with the programs he uses (Like AutoCad/Inventor3D) and maybe even last through college. Found this on sale at Staples for $599.00 right at the end of September. So, for the money I just couldn't pass this up. With the i7 processor, 12GB of Ram and 1TB HDD, this laptop has NO problems running any programs. At first we had internet connections issues which I think came from an update trying to install before we had the computer fully configured, but one call to Toshiba and they corrected the problem right away. Must say the Toshiba tech support was impressive! Only two negatives to report are 1.) The edges of this thing are sharp. It's part of the design which is nice but If you spend a lot of time on the machine it can become annoying. Especially compared to my other Toshiba P775 which has rounded edges. And 2.) This is not so much a negative or complaint as much as an observation; in shopping around I found the latest form of hard-drive in laptops are actually not a traditional hard drive at all but a form of FLASH memory. No experience with one so can't speak to if it's as great as they claim but for the same price or more you only get 15-20% of the 1TB capacity this has and if  Flash memory does turn out to be revolutionary then this computer could become obsolete sooner than I'd like.

32,MJL,"January 31, 2016",3.0 out of 5 stars,Good value for the price but the external finishing sucks.,"I purchased this Toshiba from Staples because of the rebates available.  For the size of the hard drive and the memory it is a very good deal.  So far I'm ok with everything as far at the computing goes.  I had to fight with OneDrive to get it to stop trying to sync my files without my permission and I'm having some trouble downloading drivers for my older printers but I don't think any of those problems are because of Toshiba, they're Microsoft problems.  My only complaint so far is the edges of this laptop are very sharp and rough. While I'm resting my wrists on this thing its is digging into my skin.  I have marks on my skin and I've only been typing for about 15 minutes. The finish of this laptop seems a little cheap. I had a Sony Vaio before this upgrade and the finishing on that machine was much nicer.  I'm going to have to figure out a DIY way to smooth out the edges of this laptop or it will be unusable for long bouts of typing.","Toshiba Satellite S55-C5274 15.6 Inch Laptop (Intel Core i7-5500U 2.4 GHz, 12GB DDR3L-SDRAM, 1TB HDD, Windows 10 Home 64-bit)",$499.95l

I installed the software updates in the Toshiba Service Station and then needed to restart. The PC was unable to restart Windows 10 or diagnose the problem. After resetting to the factory settings (a long process!) I called Toshiba support. Their answer was that if their updates caused a problem, I should just ignore the Toshiba updates and hope I didn't have any of the problems the updates were supposed to correct! In addition, the 90 day warranty only covers the hardware and I would have to pay for help to correct any software problems- even ones caused by their updates!!!

34,Dr. Victor S. Alpher,"November 22, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Why a 5-Star Review?,"I will admit that I'm reviewing an older Satellite, that I purchased in 2011.  However, my experience with this laptop is relevant if you are considering a Toshiba laptop, i think.  In 2012 I took the laptop out of the country and used it rather extensively in the Ukraine (220V) very successfully.  I returned home, plugged it in and have had it out of the house only to take it to Best Buy to have some work done--expanding the Ram to 16 GB.  After 2 years or so, I was running at 8 GB and no one at BB could explain this, but it wasn't under warranty. They suggested that possibly one of the two memory slots, which were replaced so that I could have an 8 GB plus 8 GB = 16 setup, had failed. There was not way to easily check this out.What did I do? I went on eBay, bought two 8 GB DDR3 memory boards (I was assured any would fit) and prayed they would work.  They did not at first.  A little wiggling, more prayer, and I'm running at 16 GB now as desired. No, I don't run a lot of graphics, but during the day I tend to have a number of programs piling up without closing some....the AMAZING thing is that after I reluctantly accepted the Windows 10 64 bit conversion, learning it, and using a two different Canon printers (one couldn't be repaired) and various Canon scanners, I have never otherwise turned the computer off for any reason.  I am getting a message that my battery needs replacing, and it might...but on the other hand, as this did not come with a 5 GHz wireless plug in, so I am using an Ethernet connection now, this laptop is still running, in November of 2018!  I am using Malawarebytes for system protection, and a back-up hard drive.  To find a letter in my email written in 2013 is very easy. I have high confidence in Toshiba, and bought another one as a backup.  I dropped it in a way that it could not be repaired (my fault), I'm now testing a Lenovo with 16 GB as my replacement cutoff was $600--and the Lenovo came with a DVD drive, the Satellite did not.  I hope not to be reporting aging on my computer longevity for a long time.","Toshiba Satellite S55-C5274 15.6 Inch Laptop (Intel Core i7-5500U 2.4 GHz, 12GB DDR3L-SDRAM, 1TB HDD, Windows 10 Home 64-bit)",$499.95l

The hard drive died within the 1 year warranty period.  I was directed to go to their website to register the laptop before I can request a warranty repair.  The website apparently did not recognize the serial number so another call to c.s. got me as far as someone will call me back, which no one did.  Waited another day, and started the whole registration process again.  They finally got the machine registered but someone will have to contact me later to start the warranty process.  No one called or emailed.I had an extra SSD laying around so I just slapped that in.  Toshiba was going to to charge me another $40 to get a recovery CD.

36,Amazon Customer,"January 13, 2016",1.0 out of 5 stars,Nightmare Laptop!,"Purchased this laptop from Staples at the beginning of September and have had nothing but problems since. The laptop would blue screen and restart all the time. Outside of the 14 day Staples return policy, I was not able to return the computer. I dealt with Toshiba support and still over 4 months later do not have a working laptop. I was also charged a $159 fee for support from Toshiba to assist me for a computer under warranty. Toshiba charges the fee up front because they say it ""may"" be software related. After 6 weeks of Toshiba support working remotely on my laptop, they finally agreed to send the computer to their repair center. Got it back 3 weeks later with a replaced hard drive and again the computer blue screened and shut down on its own. Called back Toshiba support and they now charged me $59 for Mcafee software saying my Norton Utilities was the problem and I needed to use Mcafee because it was ""preferred"" security software. Once again the computer blue screened and again I was told to send it back to the repair center. Still no working computer after more than 4 months and paying Toshiba support over $200 for a computer under warranty? As for Staples, no help at all. I am a 20 year business customer of Staples and expected more from them as they should be able to leverage Toshiba for assistance and you would think they would want to prevent Toshiba from doing this to their other customers.

37,Tony G.,"January 8, 2016",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Toshiba S55-C5274 Performs well, lots of nice features.","Bought this at OfficeMax for a great price after rebate after researching several Dell and Toshiba models. My previous laptop was a Toshiba 17"" that I got in 2009. It ran great for six years and still does, just that the CPU is old by today's standards, kind of slow, and could only hold 4GB ram max, so I wanted something faster with a newer processor.I really miss the larger 17"" display, but I can get used to it. Otherwise this S55-C5274 has everything else I was looking for. Large 1TB hard drive, 12GB of ram, and the Intel® Core™ i7-5500U Processor with turbo boost (it runs between 2.4Ghz up to 3.0GHz as needed). This laptop boots really quick for my purposes, yes I could put in a 500GB SSD for a couple of hundred bucks and gain an even faster boot time, but for my needs this laptop is quick enough as-is.This laptop has dual band WiFi with 802.11ac, where the majority of laptops I considered were only 802.11n capable, so that's a plus.Another feature I was looking for was a backlit keyboard, this is a great feature when working in bed with dim lighting. As soon as you touch a key the entire keyboard back lights. The backlit feature times out after a period of no key press (about 12 seconds, but I think it is adjustable in settings).Also another plus, all three USB ports are USB 3.0, with one of them supporting ""sleep and charge"" where you can charge a USB device while the laptop is in sleep mode or OFF.There are only two things I can complain about:1. No HardDisk activity light. I like knowing when there is hard drive activity so you can tell if the PC is locked up or not during lengthy operations.  Why omit this feature? An LED only costs about 10 cents.2. The audio quality could be a bit better. It's loud enough and pretty clear, but could use a bit more hi-fidelity as bass response is lacking.So far I haven't had any issues with this machine. It's fast and I've had multiple tasks going with absolutely no noticeable slowdown.I'm still getting used to Windows 10, not a great fan of it yet, and of course had to remove some of the pre-loaded software garbage that most manufacturer's are putting on their products these days. First thing to nuke was McAfee Virus software among other non essential stuff.Once you clean out the bloatware and make a few tweaks to startup programs, this laptop performs very well.Would I buy it again? Yes. Would I recommend to a friend? Yes again.","Toshiba Satellite S55-C5274 15.6 Inch Laptop (Intel Core i7-5500U 2.4 GHz, 12GB DDR3L-SDRAM, 1TB HDD, Windows 10 Home 64-bit)",$499.95l
38,Meg,"August 5, 2018",1.0 out of 5 stars,Has not held up well,"I got this model about two years ago, and it is now literally falling apart; the front of the DVD player fell off in my hand this morning. It had always felt loose ever since I got it, and today it just dropped right off the computer when I picked it up. The touch pad has never registered a right-click unless I jam it down. It occasionally decides not to charge, which would be less of a problem if the battery life wasn't so bad. As others have mentioned, the fan is constantly running and is super loud, and it tends to get very warm very quickly, to the point where it is uncomfortable to have in your lap. I'm not even a gamer; the most I'm asking this thing to run is Netflix.I had heard good things about Toshiba, but overall, I'm very disappointed. All of my prior laptops have lasted at least 4 years before needing to be replaced, but I feel like even one more year would be pushing it for this one. I'll be looking elsewhere when I need a replacement.","Toshiba Satellite S55-C5274 15.6 Inch Laptop (Intel Core i7-5500U 2.4 GHz, 12GB DDR3L-SDRAM, 1TB HDD, Windows 10 Home 64-bit)",$499.95l
39,Privacy,"March 20, 2016",1.0 out of 5 stars,S55 is the worst laptop I have ever purchased,"The touchpad is defective.  It just stops working.  When you go to Toshiba Support to troubleshoot, it suggests you turn it off and then on again, using the F5 key.  Then you discover that the F5 key does what the F4 key label says it is supposed to do - toggle between the laptop and external monitors.  Several other really terrible design choices.  In addition to not working, touchpad is off-center on the devise.  To use the F1-F12 keys you have to hold the FN key down (in other words, rather than just hitting F2 to quickly edit a formula in Excel, you have to hold down FN-F2 - otherwise you turn down the brightness of the screen).  The edges of the laptop are sharp, so that when you are typing and you lean your wrists on the machine, the edges cut into your skin.  There are a lot of other issues, but I suspect they are Windows 10 related (which is a whole other issue).  I had a Toshiba Portege that worked well from startup 5 years ago until it got too small to use all the new bloated software, so I thought I would be OK buying another Toshiba.  BIG MISTAKE.

This laptop however started falling apart the moment I purchased it. It came with a manufacturing flaw, three light spots on the screen from damaged pixels. Three months in there was a problem with the wifi chip. I called Toshiba to send in the computer however they wouldn't let me access my guarantee (Which I paid $50 for) without paying a crazy $116 customer service subscription. I ended up bringing it to a private guy and now I have to use an external wifi stick because he couldn't figure out what was wrong with the chip. I have owned it for eight months and the speakers are fading out, I can't lean the screen back past a 90 degree angle without the screen going blank. The keyboard has three sticky keys with one missing. Its a lot of expensive features in a cheap frame.

44,Robert Sala,"June 12, 2016",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great price for the specs!,"Let me start by saying that a lot of the negative reviews that I am reading have to do with the operating system (Windows 10) and it's updates. These same complaints I read them with other brands, not just Toshiba. Where does the problem rely? Your using Microsoft! Microsoft impacts the physical and virtual memory thus affecting the battery endurance plus the processor speed. Thus is why we also hear the fan really kicking it in order to keep the processor and video card cool. I left Windows and Apple years ago (10 years to be exact) and have been an avid user of Linux. Linux does not hog your memory, does not defragment, does not need an antivirus since there are no known viruses, trojans, rootkits, RAT's or malware than can affect the operating system. As a result, you get a behaved pc or laptop that maximzes the performance without impacting it's resources; the battery, ram, graphics card, hard drive speed, etc. I use Deepin OS and it makes this laptop run incredibly smooth. As to the person that said the screen looks ""glary"", there are thousand of pc's or laptops that come this way. If it makes you happy, buy an anti-glare screen protection like the cellphones and it performs a double feature. Thus Tishiba has a truebrite HD screen and that is a good thing! As to the person saying that the corners are sharp, really?! Give me a break! This laptop is NOoT heavy and it is beautifully finished. So there it is folks, change your operating system to your favorite Linux distribution and this laptop outperforms others for the specs and price!","Toshiba Satellite S55-C5274 15.6 Inch Laptop (Intel Core i7-5500U 2.4 GHz, 12GB DDR3L-SDRAM, 1TB HDD, Windows 10 Home 64-bit)",$499.95l
