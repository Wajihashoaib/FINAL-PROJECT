0,BasicTek,"June 23, 2015",3.0 out of 5 stars,I had a Daunting wish list for a new laptop and Toshiba deilvered untill it started breaking!,"I got everything I wanted with this Toshiba and then some. On my list were the following...Intel I(3,5, or 7) processor at least 8 GB RAM, 14 - 15"" screen with at least 1920x1080 resolution, SSD (none of this hybrid nonsense and as far as I'm concerned the only reason laptops are coming with things like 54000 RPM drives, and wireless n, is to dump and overstock of now obsolete hardware). Anyway back to the list, a backlit keyboard, dual band wireless, touch screen, tablet capability (either flipping or detaching), light weight, good battery life, and the big kicker I didn't want to pay over $700 (really $500 or $600 was the sweet price). I had been on the lookout for many months maybe even over a year, and there were always a couple features missing or the price was extremely high (or more often both features missing like SSD and higher price). When this laptop finally came across my path it was on slickdeals posted for adorama at $699. It was my wife's bday and I didn't have the funds, but I keep searching for the model # to see if any other deals would come up while I found the money. Then a refurb shows up on amazon for $550 (bonus was a year free interest on my amazon card). Everything on my list was met or exceeded (best processor, more memory, wireless AC, very good reviews, just an amazing combination of hardware. Now I could remove a star for Windows 8.1 but will let that slide as 10 for free will be out soon. This laptop will boot from off in 4 seconds, that's really 4 seconds and you can start working, it's completely ready (I have tweaked it a little and removed some pre installed software), Even though refurb the one I got was indistinguishable from new and has no issues whatsoever, wifi is perfect (I saw some complain about that), the speed and performance of this laptop is extraordinary for day to day tasks. It's not being used for gaming so any video card limitations are no issue. Toshiba did a great job here and I wish more companies would package desirable hardware and not just obsolete junk they need to dump off on unknowing consumers. If they had more stars I'd give them. BRAVO Toshiba!!!!!To note: Reason from going from 5 stars to 3. About 8 months later (5 outside the refurb warranty) our touchpad mouse broke. While I wouldn't use a touchpad my wife couldn't live without it. I got a replacement on ebay for $12 and installed it easily in about 45 min. This may have been a bigger problem for folks that don't know how to repair laptops. I'm still giving it 5 stars for super performance and a minor low cost problem but others should take note this is not  the only mouse failure reported they are common. About 2 years later the keyboard has keys falling off and intermittently not working. the LCD display is leaking or something on the bottom so it is deteriorating (this may be form being bumped but there is no visual damage) Overall I reduced the rating to 3 stars because I've had too many issues with a laptop that rarely leaves the house. Still a powerful beast but seemingly a little fragile or not built as well as some other name brands","Toshiba Flagship 2-in-1 Convertible Tablet UltraBook 15.6"" Touchscreen Laptop P55W-B5318 - Intel Core i7-4510U - 12GB DDR3L Ram Memory - 256GB SSD Solid State Drive Satin Gold",$449.00
1,mariolina,"December 31, 2016",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Defective keyboard, long wait for repairs, cosmetic damage by repair shop - Would NOT buy again","I chose this laptop for its great specs (at the time I bought it) -- a large screen, convertible format, USB 3.0 drives, a solid state drive, and so forth. At the time, there were virtually no reviews because it was brand new to the market. I had been signifcantly underemployed and even unemployed during the Great Recesssion and I've have been playing catch-up ever since, so this notebook was a significant expense for me, but I had to buy one because I had enrolled in a programming course. Unfortunately, I soon realized that the keyboard was defective, and I had to send it back to be repaired. The repair took over two months, so I wasn't able to use it for my course. I did manage to borrow a friend's underpowered laptop, but it was a huge inconvenience for both of us. When I finally got my repaired computer back, I immediately saw that the repair center had damaged the case. The damage was cosmetic, so I reluctantly let it go because I had already inconvenienced my friend enough. However, after skimping, saving, and waiting for something as long as I have for this, and even breaking my budget, and then not being able to use it for its primary purpose, the scratches just added insult to injury. The rule for buying high tech is to buy it when you need it, never in advance, because the capabilies will increase and the prices will drop dramatically. I feel cheated because I didn't get to use this for the purpose I bought it for when I needed it, and during the over two months of downtime while I waited for it to be repaired, better options became available at lower prices. I would NEVER had bought a laptop over two months before I planned to use it, but that's what happened. Not to mention that when you buy something new, especially when you are paying more than the average cost for that item, you deserve to receive something in pristine, perfect, new condition, not scratched up, as this was when I finally was able to use it.This has to rank as one of the very worst shopping experiences in my life.Final summary: After getting the defective keyboard fixed, this turned out to be a pretty nice computer, and I would have ranked it higher if it had worked as it should have out of the box, and if Toshiba's customer server and repair had been acceptable. More than anything -- features, speed, portability, and other factors, computers need to be reliable.","Toshiba Flagship 2-in-1 Convertible Tablet UltraBook 15.6"" Touchscreen Laptop P55W-B5318 - Intel Core i7-4510U - 12GB DDR3L Ram Memory - 256GB SSD Solid State Drive Satin Gold",$449.00
2,Southern Gal,"January 4, 2016",5.0 out of 5 stars,Toshiba 2-in-i Convertible Tablet UltraBook rocks!,"This is my third Toshiba in a row, and once again I am not disappointed. However, this is my first experience with both a touch screen and a tablet, and having both in a laptop is pure heaven! I love the size, the [familiar-to-me] keyboard layout, the ease of operation, the perfect touch of the keyboard keys, the quick response of the touch pad, and the ease and convenience of the touch screen that operates on both the laptop and the tablet. And the 360 degree flip-and-fold feature provides five convenient modes: laptop, audience, presentation, tabletop and tablet. Awesome!  A couple of minor issues for me are the USB port on the left side is very close to the outlet for the power cord and it's a bit tight, and the cord plug itself sometimes comes loose and falls out on its own accord. I don't know why that is but I just put it back in. Neither of these is a big issue for me, just room for a little improvement in future models. Also, this my first laptop without an optical drive but I purchased an external drive for about $20 that works fine and meets my need. While it's true an internal drive is more convenient if you use it a lot like I do, it's really not a big deal to attach a USB drive that you can easily take with you. Buy one that is powered by USB and let the laptop run it without the need for electricity.Everything works well; the memory card reader is on the left, beside the USB port; two more USB and a HDMI port are on the right. The small power button is also on the left side. I overlooked this when I first got the laptop and asked for help from the community to find it. I wear glasses and it's pretty small and almost flush with the laptop frame so I missed it. Pardon my red face.  The screen resolution is bright and beautiful while the built in Harman/Kardon speakers provide good sound. The keyboard, complete with numeric keyboard on the right side, is laid out well for comfort and functionality. The backlight is the way to go: my last Toshiba had a backlight, and I will never again buy a laptop or computer keyboard without one. Again, I wear glasses and this is tremendously helpful to my vision as well as using the keyboard in poorly lit situations or in a bedroom, etc.  For some who have dissed Toshiba as ""junk"" I would disagree. I've had two Toshiba laptops in the past that have been real work horses and they were very heavily used. Both of them still work although memory problems [I have that too!], and generally outdated technology forced me to replace them. Other that that, I never had a problem or complaint with either of them. I had total confidence buying this Toshiba, and searched for Toshiba laptops exclusively in fact.  In summary, aside from the minor issues scarcely worth mentioning, I am extremely happy with this wonderful, lightweight Toshiba 2-in1, and I look forward to it giving me trouble free service for many years. So buy it and enjoy.","Toshiba Flagship 2-in-1 Convertible Tablet UltraBook 15.6"" Touchscreen Laptop P55W-B5318 - Intel Core i7-4510U - 12GB DDR3L Ram Memory - 256GB SSD Solid State Drive Satin Gold",$449.00
3,Deborah L,"July 1, 2016",2.0 out of 5 stars,TOSHIBA 2 in 1 CONVERTIBLE TABLET DYING IN LESS THAN A YEAR,"I love the style of it. And it's heavy but I expected that because it's big. But I've only had it 1 year and 2 months and there are cracks in the bottom of the casing ON BOTH SIDES, right at the corners, where the sides of the bottom cover leaves the keyboard to leave a space for the USB ports on one side and miscellaneous ports on the other side. This is a CLEAR design flaw.  And now one of the control keys doesn't work. Ridiculous.I was so happy to get this as it looked like I was finally going to have a Toshiba where the hinges at the bottom of the screen didn't wear out LONG BEFORE the hard drive did. Even if that turns out to be true, I have a bigger problem. I'm getting blue screen crashes. The first one happened 2 months ago, maybe less. The computer started right back up and apologized for the error, so it didn't LOOK LIKE the blue screen crashes of old -- that signal that the hard drive is dying -- but now I'm not so sure.I think I probably should have contacted Toshiba when it first happened and got a replacement, because yesterday it happened again -- another blue screen memory error. The computer said it was going to restart after it reported something to microsoft, but it didn't. I pressed the start button and it restarted without any problems but I'm nervous I spent the best part of $1000 on fire buying this thing.If it goes in less than 2 to 3 years, I'm done with Toshiba. I put up with the cheap cases because the hard drives didn't die in the old laptops I had. I even spilled tea into one of them TWICE, it kept running. The thing that made me get rid of it was the hinge on the screen falling to pieces, just like the one before it, and the one before that.If this hard drive doesn't last, I'm done. I'm going to write to Toshiba. If they attempt to ""make me whole,"" as they say I'll write another update.","Toshiba Flagship 2-in-1 Convertible Tablet UltraBook 15.6"" Touchscreen Laptop P55W-B5318 - Intel Core i7-4510U - 12GB DDR3L Ram Memory - 256GB SSD Solid State Drive Satin Gold",$449.00
4,Crimsoncascade,"June 17, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great value, huge high def tablet, silent speedy laptop","I was extremely surprised by the value of this laptop.  I bought refurbished here on Amazon from Intent -- the item looks brand new and was insanely cheap.  First off, the laptop is completely silent.  No fan, no harddrive. Complete silence.  Second, I've been getting battery life around 10 hours, which has changed my life.  Third, while  the wifi reception is a bit poor [it doesn't reach into rooms that my other laptops will still get a signal in], I was pleasantly surprised by much better transfer rates than my other (recent model) laptops, so that is a tradeoff I'll take.  Third, ssd drive means immediate startup and other kinds of speed.  When I was transferring files using a 16gig USB stick from my last Toshiba (only a year old), my old Toshiba would take something like 10 minutes to copy the files onto the stick, while this Toshiba would transfer from the stick in a minute or two.  So I find everything VERY FAST.  Fourth, for whatever reason, this laptop worked out of the box seemlessly with my NAS.  Finally, I have various 7 and 8 inch Kindle Fire's, but when you fold this screen back, you have a whopping 15.6"" High Def Tablet.  I wasn't really expecting to enjoy it that much, since I use it mostly as a laptop.  I'll tell you that when I folded it back in a room of people on their phones and Ipads and Kindles, and I started looking through my photos and using an app or two, every eye in the room was on me, asking what I was using.  The only negative I have found is that because it's a fully high def screen, the default size of text etc. is pretty small, and my eyes aren't what they used to be.  So I have to pinch and zoom a bit to make webpages bigger, but that's what a fully hi def screen means.  What perks aren't to like?  Backlit keyboard, two button trackpad, super thin and sleek, etc.  It seems to have the features and performance of nearly identical laptops twice the price.","Toshiba Flagship 2-in-1 Convertible Tablet UltraBook 15.6"" Touchscreen Laptop P55W-B5318 - Intel Core i7-4510U - 12GB DDR3L Ram Memory - 256GB SSD Solid State Drive Satin Gold",$449.00
5,J. Starns,"October 18, 2016",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Worked great for three months, now it's a hunk of junk.","I purchased this laptop for work.  It worked super fast for the first few months.  Lightning fast.  Then about the 6 month mark, it started giving me warnings about the cooling system. I googled all the workarounds, tried a ton of things to help this error message go away. Shortly after that the fan would start up and be super loud.  Like a weed wacker outside buzzing.  I took it to a work meeting and people actually stared at me my laptop was so loud.  This is my first laptop, so I thought they just ""do"" that.  It would work great if I was on a remote server, but the literal second I went on line, just one page mind you, Facebook.  I wasn't gaming or anything, and the fan would sound like the machine was going to explode.  Now conveniently just after the 1 year warranty mark, the cooling warning system pops up and the fan won't even turn on.  Sometimes I can knock gently and it will slowly whirl on.  Some times prayer works, sometimes it just won't come on at all.  Matter of fact I am writing this review on my home computer and not my laptop, because it won't stay on long enough for me to leave a review.  It stays on for two minutes at a time. Very sad about this purchase.  I do not have $900 more dollars to buy a lap top every year.  It seems this particular laptop is basically disposable, as they did not build it to last past it's warranty.  Be warned, you will be disappointed in this lap top.  It will fail you when you need it most.  If I can save just one person from the heartache of buying this computer, I have done my job.  Now I'm back stuck at my desk just so I can get my regular work done.  Thanks for nothing Toshiba.  I will never buy your products again.","Toshiba Flagship 2-in-1 Convertible Tablet UltraBook 15.6"" Touchscreen Laptop P55W-B5318 - Intel Core i7-4510U - 12GB DDR3L Ram Memory - 256GB SSD Solid State Drive Satin Gold",$449.00
6,DaveG,"December 30, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,Seems to Be the Beast People Say It Is,"Starting Out Well.  Others said it was powerful and it is not disappointing.  For comparison, I bought a high end desktop last year and had installed a large SSD on that and lots of RAM (and upgraded my download speed to 175 MB/s and a new 5G modem off ethernet) have been merrily enjoying that for some time.  This thing holds it's own in comparison, running with the same modem and wireless.  I run some pretty hefty stuff  - running VPN to work, graphics, 3D modelling, and some minor developing and I'm never waiting around for either machine.  I even installed Ubuntu in VirtualBox to run alongside it and am able to carve off 3 processors and 4 GB RAM to devote to that and don't notice any slowdown.  That's the positive side of this thing and it does not disappoint.I noticed that the speakers are half decent.  Though I haven't had much experience with it.The downsides have been pretty minor.  Toshiba installed a bunch of bloatware that was actually raising flags with the anti-malware software I normally install first thing.  It takes a half hour or so to clean up the machine.  I haven't quite got the hang of the screen orientation yet.  Sometimes I pick the thing up and it flips upside down virtually and takes a half minute to get its balance back.  The keyboard has different switches embedded in the normal key set to turn some things off so you can flip the screen into tablet mode and set it down on the keyboard.  So mostly these downsides are features not bugs.  I am hard pressed to complain about this and I'm difficult to please with my computers.We'll see how this fares with time.  I believed the positive reviews I read and so far not disappointed and have not encountered any problems.","Toshiba Flagship 2-in-1 Convertible Tablet UltraBook 15.6"" Touchscreen Laptop P55W-B5318 - Intel Core i7-4510U - 12GB DDR3L Ram Memory - 256GB SSD Solid State Drive Satin Gold",$449.00
7,Dustin,"June 27, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,The perfect laptop,"WHAT... A... FANTASTIC... LAPTOP!This thing is super (and I mean super) fast. It turns off and on in a snap, loads everything faster than you can say, ""Whoa!"" and not to mention, IS A TWO-IN-ONE!!!The camera quality is better than any laptop I've seen so far (yet still a little grainy),battery life is great on this thing (I can pull an average of about 6 hours),the speakers... oh my gosh the speakers. They are the most fantastic speakers I have ever heard out of any portable electronic device. I'd highly recommend this laptop solely for the speaker quality,the display is amazing as it is Full HD (1920x1080),and has a perfectly lit back light.I guess my only complaint would be the bezels of the computer.When you try to open it, you have to push somewhat hard on the bezel of the display on top, meaning you will get hard-pressed fingerprint spots in that area; thought it could just be easily wiped off even with your shirt... just thought I'd point that out.But this laptop is the most fantastic lapto-... comput-..... electronic device I have ever purchased.Yes... I know... look at the price tag. No one is going to be happy blowing almost a grand on a laptop without really knowing how it performs beforehand.But I assure you this is the best electronic device I've ever owned, and greatly look forward to what it holds in the future for school and work.

8,Sullen7,"February 23, 2015",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good 2 in1,"I have been looking for a good 2 in1 laptop for awhile. Going through reviews, and checking the specs of a bunch of computers. The one that would fit what I wanted was the previous version of this Toshiba. The problem was the reviews for it said it had horrible wifi issues. I wanted a solid state drive too, so that added another problem. This version with a SSD came out, so I ordered it. I crossed my fingers that the wifi problem didn't come with this one as well. It all worked out!!! Great computer. Wifi works on the other side of the house and upstairs to boot. Touchscreen is responsive, keyboard keys are not mushy, and display is vibrant. Only downsides so far are that the trackpad doesn't respond quickly sometimes and its a little heavy to be used as a tablet. That last one might problem for some people, so go for the thinner Yoga (its smaller though). Asus Flip 15 was also on my radar. I picked this one, super happy about it.Had the computer for about two months. Its still pretty good. This update is about how the battery life is about five hours. No where near 10 hours like Toshiba boasts.","Toshiba Flagship 2-in-1 Convertible Tablet UltraBook 15.6"" Touchscreen Laptop P55W-B5318 - Intel Core i7-4510U - 12GB DDR3L Ram Memory - 256GB SSD Solid State Drive Satin Gold",$449.00
9,Perplexed,"June 12, 2015",4.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect E-Reader for My Treadmill,"I already have a 15.6"" Windows 8 notebook so it was a bit of a stretch for me to purchase another one. The one I have has a built-in DVD drive which is pretty much useless and adds weight, and a 5200 rpm harddrive which slows everything down. I talked myself into purchasing this Toshiba Ultrabook as an e-reader for my treadmill. At 15.6"" with the font set to the largest setting, I can actually read while walking on a treadmill. When you think about it, Apple offers nothing close for the money. I would not be able to read an e-book on my IPad while walking on my treadmill and my Toshiba cost about the same as my IPad and the Toshiba has four times the memory. If you use Apple's pricing model that would be a thousand dollar IPad.My only complaints are that the space key does not always work and that the function keys activate PC features like Brightness instead of application features like Close application. I keep turning off the touchpad by accident.

10,Joshua,"July 27, 2016",5.0 out of 5 stars,Super long battery life,"Holy cow guys. This thing is incredible. Super long battery life. Incredibly fast. Perfection. It is very sturdy and durable. I hate windows 8 so I got 10. When I downloaded windows 10 it for some reason did not allow me to use Bluetooth anymore. I don't know how that happened (i probably deleted something i should not have while removing bloatware), but I just reinstalled it and made sure i downloaded all the updates for windows as well and it works flawlessly and perfectly now. I think bluetooth was a great idea. WOW GUYS THIS THING IS AWESOME! I am right now watching 2 large youtube videos, working with excell and IE, listening to spotify, and logged into facebook and this is not skipping a beat at all. NO wifi problems, i think it gets far better wifi reception then anything I've had before. Also I have had no keyboard problems at all either.UPDATE: Keyboard problems did arise. My number keypad on the right is acting up and the 9,6,and 3 keys do not work so far twice now. I bought this about 2 months ago, but all it has taken to fix is press the key that isn't work really hard, and restart the computer (WHICH BECAUSE IT IS SO AWESOME ONLY TAKES LIKE 6 SECONDS TO RESTART!!).

I use my computer all day everyday for work and transport it around on a regular basis.  The weight of the laptop is excellent compared to typical laptops of this size. It has a very thin form and fits well into my carry bag.  The touchscreen is very responsive and folding the screen back into tablet form works great and snaps into place nicely.  The keys have a nice response to them and the palm pad area is large and works well for people with bigger hands.

I'm an accountant so having the number pad on the right makes Excel spreadsheets easier to populate. Does make the tablet longer, but I only use the laptop at home - I do not carry it out of the house. Upgraded to Windows 10 after having to install some Windows updates. Got through that and then used Macrium Reflect (free version) to create the bootable USB drive and for weekly backups (we always think it will never happen to us and then one day it did years ago; learned my lesson!). Windows 8.1 was a nightmare even though I have used pcs for decades. So glad for the Windows 10 upgrade, which was free since this machine came with Windows 8.1. Very fast start-up and no lags,although I do not use it for gaming, just web browsing, work files, email, youtube, and video streaming. Was never able to, even with help from a tech-savvy 25 year old, to get a movie purchased from the Microsoft store to steam to my Chromecast to my TV from this laptap We think it was a Windows conflict.

The ribbon cable that plugs the keyboard to the motherboard is, from the factory severely kinked in a way that WILL make this laptop useless to type on. I was able to easily replace the keyboard, which cost $18. If you are good with hardware repairs then this laptop is great. Its priced right with a good processor, plentiful amounts of RAM, and a SSD. You can get a 128 GB sd card that fully fits into body to upgrade the amount of storage for cheap. The laptop feels great to type on (with the keyboard working) and has a very solid a durable feel to it.

Hands down, the best laptop I have ever owned - and I have owned many!  Then.......the ""A"" key randomly stopped working. I would have to strike it several times and then it would finally work. Then the ""N"" key, followed by the Shift, Enter, and B keys.....intermittently they work just fine, but randomly they stop working entirely. What was a minor annoyance soon became a HUGE problem!!! What good is a laptop if the keyboard literally doesn't work??  I couldn't even unlock the thing because my password contained an ""N"" and I could not type an ""N"" with the defective keyboard.  I went online and read every article from every forum I could find and what I found is that this is not an isolated incident.  Many others have had this same problem. What disturbs me and why I am sending this laptop back is that there is no fix for this problem and nobody really knows if the problem is with the hardware, software, or both.  To my knowledge Toshiba has yet to acknowledge this issue officially, which obviously leads one to assume there is no effort underway to fix this problem.

23,Will,"April 18, 2016",2.0 out of 5 stars,Very Disappointed with the Durability of this Laptop,"I am very disappointed with this laptop. Within a few months of purchase (Aug 2015), the keyboard stopped working. This was covered by the warranty, but I was still out the shipping cost plus the time it took to ship the laptop to and from Toshiba's repair center. Otherwise, it has worked more or less smoothly. However, it has now been seven months, and the bottom corner of the screen is coming apart at the seam. I have barely taken the laptop out of my house, and so this damage has occurred through the normal process of opening and closing the screen. When I called Toshiba, I was told that this qualified as ""physical damage"", and thus would not be covered by the warranty (and is my responsibility to have repaired at my expense). I feel that this is unacceptable, especially for a unit that is advertised as a ""2-in-1 Convertible Tablet Ultrabook"".

Windows pops up a ""do you want to enter tablet mode"" prompt because it thinks I've undocked from a docking station. The keyboard backlight stops working at the same time.

I know it's not my access point because my phone and my wife's computer both continue to see the local network. To get the connection back, I can usually just disconnect and reconnect, but sometimes I have to disable and re-enable the WiFi device.And apparently Toshiba has given up on supporting their own products.

The main issue I see out of this computer as being the culprit is the design flaw. I have replaced the fan twice because the back is flimsy, and it kept bending the fan. After the third time, the extremely fragile components were basically falling apart (the ribbon and it's connectors).

47,John Jeffrey,"June 26, 2015",3.0 out of 5 stars,Try other brands first,Works great if power button actually turns it on. Toshiba customer service provides no customer service and accuses you of damaging product instantly without listening to you. Recommend other manufacturer. If you get lucky with this though and there is no defective parts it is a great laptop.,"Toshiba Flagship 2-in-1 Convertible Tablet UltraBook 15.6"" Touchscreen Laptop P55W-B5318 - Intel Core i7-4510U - 12GB DDR3L Ram Memory - 256GB SSD Solid State Drive Satin Gold",$449.00
48,Alex,"April 4, 2016",1.0 out of 5 stars,Buyer beware!,"EDIT: July 19, 2016:After sending in the keyboard for repair, I received it back and it still didn't work! So I sent it in for repair again, and it has taken over a week because it is still ""waiting for parts!"" I am extremely displeased with this computer and appalled that Toshiba, a company I thought I liked, would sell such a bad computer and have such egregious customer service. DO NOT BUY.This item worked very well for some time. However, the keyboard stopped working after only three months. I contacted Toshiba,who repaired the unit for a $30 shipping fee. To me, it seems ridiculous that I must pay $30 to fix a manufacturer defect. Except just one month later, it stopped working again! Very displeased at the support I have received from Toshiba.","Toshiba Flagship 2-in-1 Convertible Tablet UltraBook 15.6"" Touchscreen Laptop P55W-B5318 - Intel Core i7-4510U - 12GB DDR3L Ram Memory - 256GB SSD Solid State Drive Satin Gold",$449.00
49,docman,"June 30, 2015",4.0 out of 5 stars,Minor Quirks with stiff space bar and wi-fi signal.,"Good laptop, but minor quirks. The spacebar is little sticky and annoying. Screen and built are good. Occasionally wi-fi signals can drop but it is not frequent. Overall a good laptop, wish keys were little more sensitive and wi-fi signal was more stable. One more thingI have noticed is that if I move away from the router the signals are weaker than what my older laptop used to catch!!!.","Toshiba Flagship 2-in-1 Convertible Tablet UltraBook 15.6"" Touchscreen Laptop P55W-B5318 - Intel Core i7-4510U - 12GB DDR3L Ram Memory - 256GB SSD Solid State Drive Satin Gold",$449.00
