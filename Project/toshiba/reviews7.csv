0,Nia Bwell,"September 23, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,For Some Reason Mine Has Touchscreen?,"I'm very happy with this laptop. I waited up all day yesterday waiting for it to come home. I enjoy playing games and wanted a powerful laptop to handle games like Ark: Survival Evolved and World of Warcraft. So, I am happy to report this laptop does a very good job of doing that.It's a very powerful laptop. The strongest I've ever had was a 4RAM, and of course that's not enough to play some of these heavier games which require a lot of room. And with 1TB of space I finally have the room to download what I need without having to store it on my external hard drive. So, there's a plus.As other reviewers have stated they keyboard can be a bit iffy. This honestly depends on a personal preference. The keyboard is a little shallow. Each key is ""separate"" in a with it's own little space. I personally believe this is a good design since it can help prevent the keys from getting dust and other gunk in them. Even so I had ordered a keyboard cover ahead of time. The keyboard does light up when you start typing on it which I thought was pretty cool. I type a lot and I have to keep reminding myself I don't have to press down so hard on the keys when I type.Even so, I don't mind that much. I use an external mouse and I did invest in a usb extender for this laptop. There are three usb ports, but two are on the right side while one is on the left. I would suggest getting a usb extender at the very least for this laptop. Especially if you like to backup a lot of files or are using this laptop for work and play. A decent one only costs like $10 if that. It's a good investment and can save a lot of frustration later.My only thing I found odd is that for some reason the one I received includes a touchscreen. I thought this was odd and thought on the packaging this was just a mistake. Nope. The Toshiba Satellite I received is indeed touchscreen. This doesn't bother me since I don't care either way. I rarely use touchscreen as it is and had wanted a laptop without it just to prevent smears on my screen. However, it was a nice little surprise regardless. So maybe they updated the laptop to be touchscreen?Regardless, I love this powerful laptop. Sound is excellent on it. It has bluetooth. A few things you may want to invest in for it though are: USB Extender, Keyboard Cover, and a decent set of Bluetooth speakers if you want your sound really loud (or headphones.) Give this laptop 5 stars. It's the first one I've ever bought on my own. I love the Toshiba brand.Update 10/12/2015: Computer still works great. The sound for this computer is not quite as loud as I would like it, but good enough for watching Youtube or something. Putting in a pair of headphones or having a decent bluetooth speaker does the trick too.","2015 Toshiba Satellite S55-B5280 High Performance Laptop, Intel Core i7-5500U(up to 3.0GHz), 15.6-inch HD Display, 12GB DDR3L, 1TB HDD, Windows 8.1",$565.00
1,Putputt,"May 26, 2015",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not too impressed.,"Okay, so I've only had this laptop for a few days, and I am returning it because I think I was unlucky enough to get one with connectivity issues. Ever since Day 1 it has a bad habit of disconnecting me for a few seconds and then reconnecting me. None of the other laptops or gadgets in the house is doing it, so it's definitely not a modem issue.Aside from that, which again, is probably just my bad luck, I haven't been too impressed or disappointed by this laptop. There was something weird that kept happening the first few days, which was that whenever the computer went to Sleep mode, all my windows would close. Firefox, Chrome...they'd just close, as though the computer had been shut down. What's even weirder is that it stopped doing that after about 3 days or so. There were also other things...like when I changed the desktop wallpaper, it changed back to its old wallpaper automatically. I had to change it several times before it stayed. It's really strange as these are not issues I have ever had with any of my previous laptops. I have no clue what happened there, but it's one of the reasons why my first days with the laptop were so rough.I haven't bothered installing any of my games on this, so I don't know how it performs gaming-wise. I have noticed the laptop becoming warmer under my wrists when I open Google Docs, which is surprising because I didn't think Google Docs is that demanding. I am currently using the laptop in Norcal, but I live in the tropics, so it worries me that it's becoming warm in Norcal weather.On a more superficial level, the laptop looks fine when it's open, but when closed, it is really ugly. This doesn't bother me much, but it's maybe worth pointing out. :DAll in all, for the price, I'm not too impressed with it. I think there are better laptops within the price range out there.","2015 Toshiba Satellite S55-B5280 High Performance Laptop, Intel Core i7-5500U(up to 3.0GHz), 15.6-inch HD Display, 12GB DDR3L, 1TB HDD, Windows 8.1",$565.00
2,Ricardo,"July 28, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,So far the best laptop I've ever used,"I think this is my first review ever on a purchase at Amazon. So far (1 week) I am very happy with this laptop. First I have to say I had my concerns over buying a ""like new"" item. Well, it was really like new, and I mean new. The laptop had even the original plastic cover on the screen.Regarding the laptop per se, I bought it for my wife who work as a graphic designer, and I just can say that the laptop exceeded our expectations. It is very fast (it is a 12 gb ram pc), very quiet and by far much less heavier that my old laptop.In some reviews I read that there some issues with the keyboard and the touch pad. In that department, we don't have any complaints yet. The keyboard itself is very responsive, and it is very quiet when you type, also I like the fact that is has the numeric pad just like a regular PC keyboard. The touchpad responds also very nice, it has some cool functions like zooming just like the touch screen of a cell phone, but then my wife it's going to be using a mouse so the touch pad wasn't even an issue.I will try to write an update after using the laptop for some time, but so far so good...... Update  as of 08/12/2015Still loving the laptop. Upgraded to windows 10 a few days ago. Really awsome PC.","2015 Toshiba Satellite S55-B5280 High Performance Laptop, Intel Core i7-5500U(up to 3.0GHz), 15.6-inch HD Display, 12GB DDR3L, 1TB HDD, Windows 8.1",$565.00
3,That One Lady,"April 17, 2015",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Fast, Relatviely Light and Thin, A Few Downsides","So I should start by saying I really like this laptop. It is quite fast, great battery life for a full size laptop, and seems to handle whatever I throw at it quite nicely. It's kind of large for the screen size - when it arrived I thought I had accidentally purchased the 17"" but it's just that there is an inch or so extra on the left and right sides of the keyboard. Not sure why they made that choice, but it's been fine after my initial surprise.The system feels pretty solid although I have noticed a bit of flex in the top (display) when I am walking around with it. The keyboard has a nice feel, and the touch pad is responsive, good overall. My one quibble with the touch pad is that clicking is quite loud.Overall, so far it has performed exceptionally well, especially for the price point.The main reason it isn't getting 5 stars is something I didn't think through until it actually arrived. The battery isn't user-replaceable. Which makes it almost a disposable laptop when the battery starts losing life or dies. That said, I am still pretty pleased with the speed and build quality.","2015 Toshiba Satellite S55-B5280 High Performance Laptop, Intel Core i7-5500U(up to 3.0GHz), 15.6-inch HD Display, 12GB DDR3L, 1TB HDD, Windows 8.1",$565.00

6,Joaquin Estevez,"September 1, 2021",3.0 out of 5 stars,... a year now and it still looks and works great. I am a college student,"So I have had this laptop for over a year now and it still looks and works great. I am a college student, and I use my laptop often for school and leisure. The laptop itself has a beautiful appearance and nice texture.  It doesn't overheat, which is something I was worried about because my previous laptop had overheated and died often. The only thing I had to get used to was the mouse pad, but that was just a personal preference thing. The laptop also doesn't have a lock to close it, so sometimes it won't close all the way. Overall this is a nice laptop that will last a good amount of time. (oh and I updated to the windows 10 version which is a MUCH better version than the 8.1 version that came with the computer.)","2015 Toshiba Satellite S55-B5280 High Performance Laptop, Intel Core i7-5500U(up to 3.0GHz), 15.6-inch HD Display, 12GB DDR3L, 1TB HDD, Windows 8.1",$565.00

My laptop does not work well and hangs frequently almost since the start. I couldn't instale any program (Chrome, Mozilla, Skype etc.) I could use only Internet Explorer. Something was wrong with battery. Laptop always was discharged. I couldn't understand it. I stopped use it because this laptop pissed off me all time. One day I couldn't open any file. I'm not technical. I stopped use laptop for 5 months. Last week I asked my friend to check the laptop. He said that I have thermally damaged processor. It is crazy I almost didn't use laptop. I'm pissed of!! I burned my money. I can't return this laptop because I move to Poland (I must came back to home and help my family. They had very big problem with health).
