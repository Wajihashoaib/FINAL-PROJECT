2,Amazon Customer,"January 26, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Toshiba in Disguise,"It was time to finally replace my beloved Toshiba Satellite, but because I had purchased my Toshiba at Sam's Club, and Sam's Club closed since that time, I was struggling to find a suitable replacement at my local stores.  Although I was reluctant to purchase a computer online, I found this Toshiba (aka Dynabook) through Amazon and thought I would give it a try.  So far I'm very happy with the computer I received and glad that I didn't sacrifice all the things I have grown to like on my computer just to buy one locally.","Dynabook Toshiba Satellite Pro L50-G Business Computer, 15.6"" FHD Laptop, Intel Quard-Core i7-10510U, 64GB DDR4 RAM, 2TB PCIe SSD, GeForce MX250 2GB, Bluetooth, WiFi, Webcam, Type-C, Windows 10 Pro","$2,399.00"

4,Amazon Customer,"June 1, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Shipping time was great. I received it in Panama in only 1 week,"I bought this computer for a young man who is going to school to become an architect.  He needed a high performance computer and the Dynabook fit the bill.  I always buy  a Toshiba and was surprised to see that Toshba had sold away their pc business.  I suspect Toshiba corporation still owns this division and just spun it off under a holding company.  I have not had time to checkout why they did this, but I will.  Also this particular computer has a DVD drive which are being phased out in favor of the Mp3or 4 players to USB ports.  I am 74 and in the old days 80's/90's I was consider a computer geek.  but once I retired in my 50's, I stopped keeping up with the new technology and was just enjoying life.","Dynabook Toshiba Satellite Pro L50-G Business Computer, 15.6"" FHD Laptop, Intel Quard-Core i7-10510U, 64GB DDR4 RAM, 2TB PCIe SSD, GeForce MX250 2GB, Bluetooth, WiFi, Webcam, Type-C, Windows 10 Pro","$2,399.00"
5,Melanie Dickerson,"May 6, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,I love Toshiba,"I miss my old Toshiba laptops that were not very expensive but lasted forever. I'm not as happy with this one, partly because of the price, but also because the speaker sometimes malfunctions, and I don't know, I guess I was expecting it to somehow be amazing in ways my old Toshiba wasn't, since this was more than twice the price.

7,Stephen G. DAquin,"October 24, 2020",3.0 out of 5 stars,WHY LEAVE OUT THE SIMPLE THINGS THAT LAPTOP OWNERS NEED??,"We have been Toshiba Laptop fans for decades.  Our last Toshiba Satellite lasted over 10 years.  After an upgrade to the hard drive and ram, it is still going strong.  When searching for the specific laptop we wanted, we detailed TOUCH SCREEN, BACK-LIT KEYBOARD, TOSHIBA LAPTOP, and the RAM/HD we wanted.The Tecra quickly came up.  We bought it for $1,300 with a massive hard drive and 32G Ram.  While the laptop itself is solid and on fire, there is NO BACK-LIT KEYBOARD and NO TOUCH SCREEN.  After this massive disappointment, we decided to purchase a touch screen monitor and a back-lit keyboard.Now, basically, our would-be great laptop is a great desktop.Be careful in your searches, because they will leave out the things that are the most important to you.","Dynabook Toshiba Satellite Pro L50-G Business Computer, 15.6"" FHD Laptop, Intel Quard-Core i7-10510U, 64GB DDR4 RAM, 2TB PCIe SSD, GeForce MX250 2GB, Bluetooth, WiFi, Webcam, Type-C, Windows 10 Pro","$2,399.00"
