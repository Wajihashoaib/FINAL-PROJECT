0,Karen RH55,"July 16, 2015",1.0 out of 5 stars,Buyer Beware...,"My old computer finally died after 10 years of continuous use. I did my research and homework and finally decided on the Toshiba. My husband had a Toshiba for over 10 years as his main computer at home and it served him well. I liked that when I took it out of the box and turned it on, it did not boot to the Windows 8 screen... I am looking forward to Windows 10 coming out later in the month.The computer has been easy to set up and move all my files from my other computer without any problems. Looking forward to using this computer.REVISION TO MY REVIEW AS OF October 14, 2015After using the computer since July 15, 2015 the keyboard stopped working. I spoke with Toshiba about the problem since it was within the first 90 days of ownership, I contacted Toshiba about the problem. Before they would talk to me, I had to purchase the 'Premium Protection Plan' to the tune of $159.95.. The tech attempted to fix the problem on line, however that didn't work. I was transferred to a higher level of tech and they wanted me to send the computer back to them. I had to pay an additional $30 to get a box and shipping label to ship it back to Toshiba. I purchased the box and they sent it to me via FedEx... I boxed the computer up and sent it back on Monday, October 5, 2015 and got it back, supposedly repaired on Friday, October 9, 2015. I got home from work, opened the box, read the report about they were able to 'duplicate the problem' with the same results I had reported. They replaced the keyboard cable and my computer was repaired.' I took the computer out of the box, plugged it in, turned it on, logged into my account, and that's as far as I could go. After entering my user name and password, The keyboard would not let me go any further than logging in. When I attempted to check my email and write responses,it would not allow me to go any further. I called Toshiba back to let them know the computer was not repaired, their answer was for me to send it back to them again, and they would 'try' to repair it again.I know this wasn't a very expensive computer, however, I did expect it to work for more than a few days. I used my old computer daily since 2005...and I am typing this update on my review on my old computer...It's slow and old, but it still works.I opened a chat dialog with Customer Service at  Amazon about the problem, explained everything to them, they offered to give me a refund on the computer. I sent the computer back to Amazon and will now look for another computer... Thanks Amazon for standing  behind the products you sell.",Toshiba Satellite C55-B5270 Laptop PC - Intel Pentium N3530 2.16 GHz Quad-Core Processor - 8 GB DDR3L SDRAM - 500 GB Hard Drive - 15.6-inch Display - Windows 8.1 - Jet Black,$687.00
1,Amazon Customer,"May 3, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,Exceptional for the Price,"This is an exceptional laptop for the price. I would say this computer offers real value--you could pay $200 or more and get less performance from other laptops.I see some people write negative reviews because1. - Mouse pad did not work and2. - WiFi dropping. I initially had both these problems, then I read the manual. Both of these things are controlled by the function keys, and when I discovered that, all my problems went away in about 2 seconds.As a low-end laptop, it has the Pentium chip, which was the standard just a few years ago. The Pentium is a great workhorse and is especially good with the 8 gigs of RAM this computer comes with. I use MS Word and PowerPoint extensively on this laptop and performance is excellent as you would expect. I am still using software from a few years ago, notably Photoshop CS4 and InDesign CS4, and they run as fast as ever. I also run audio recording software, and I have no problems with recording or playback.This laptop also streams Amazon Prime and Netflix videos just fine. The screen is not full HD (1920 x 1080), but it is sharp and clear and most people will be more than satisfied with the resolution and color of the regular HD (1280 x 720) that this screen displays.Any drawbacks? I could hope for a better keyboard. It works as expected, but takes getting used to. If I were to use this laptop to replace my desktop (unlikely), I would plug-in a full sized keyboard. It takes no effort to plug-in both a standard keyboard and big monitor, so that is a possibility.I'm a computer guy and have put this laptop through its paces. I'm a satisfied customer.",Toshiba Satellite C55-B5270 Laptop PC - Intel Pentium N3530 2.16 GHz Quad-Core Processor - 8 GB DDR3L SDRAM - 500 GB Hard Drive - 15.6-inch Display - Windows 8.1 - Jet Black,$687.00
2,RUSSDALL,"February 28, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,""" I absolutely ""Do Not Regret"" my purchase ""","Did a lot of research before I bought this laptop,and found with it's 8GB of memory, it was one of the best deals out there. Plus being a tech guy for years, I knew that the Toshiba name was solid as far as laptops go. I read the good and bad reviews, (which always gives a person mixed feelings after reading), and decided to go for it. ""Glad I Did"" excellent choice. Did not experience any of the negative experiences that people had mentioned.  Started solid, no issues, updated windows 8.1...(which was installed)..used Toshiba's utility to update needed drivers.....and I was off to the races. No issues with network connection dropping out. Listened to iheart radio for 2 hours without any delays what so ever. Laptop is plenty fast enough for the processor and ram it has. Would be more than enough for most college students. Plays Minecraft smoothly, ( always a plus..LOL) for those boring hotel stays.Movies and steaming video look great on it. Windows 8.1 is a learning curve, if you've never use it. But easy to get used to, and can be tweaked to your liking.All and all, a great little computer for the money.. Also shipping was super fast. Good Luck in your search.....  I absolutely ""Do Not Regret"" my purchase",Toshiba Satellite C55-B5270 Laptop PC - Intel Pentium N3530 2.16 GHz Quad-Core Processor - 8 GB DDR3L SDRAM - 500 GB Hard Drive - 15.6-inch Display - Windows 8.1 - Jet Black,$687.00
3,Kindle Customer,"October 9, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a sturdy laptop with the ""normal"" amount of bloatware (which I ...","I got this for a grandson - more RAM than in laptops you normally see in the big box stores (8G is minimum for my taste, but most other laptops for under $400 have only 4G).  This is a sturdy laptop with the ""normal"" amount of bloatware (which I removed through Control Center).  I also removed free trial programs which hound you with pop ups.  This unit has less than most I've helped people with.  The keyboard seems solid.  It was a great value for the price.  I'm not thrilled with Windows 8 (had to hunt for the system modifications), but you have to go with the times.  My grandson doesn't mind the system placing his photos and downloads.  Oh, and it comes with MS Office.  I also loaded two of the top freeware anti-virus programs and removed Norton, which is a trial version.  Some laptops in this price range also do not have a DVD-ROM - so that and the 8G RAM were deciding factors in this choice.",Toshiba Satellite C55-B5270 Laptop PC - Intel Pentium N3530 2.16 GHz Quad-Core Processor - 8 GB DDR3L SDRAM - 500 GB Hard Drive - 15.6-inch Display - Windows 8.1 - Jet Black,$687.00
4,Dane,"June 17, 2016",2.0 out of 5 stars,It's just that I've had so many stupid problems within a few months of getting it,"I mean, the computer works... It's just that I've had so many stupid problems within a few months of getting it. The external frame is so flimsy - cheap plastic - that all of the screws holding the bottom together fell out. I had to put them back in and then cover them with duct tape to keep them from coming out. What else... The computer is kind of slow, has random on and off issues. Naturally, Windows 8 sucks.I guess what I'm saying is that I wasn't expecting a high end computer for the price... But when I bought a cheap computer, I wanted something not high end but functional on its level. It makes me mad when a computer fails within months of me getting it in very simple departments like the construction of the plastic case. That just shows a lack of care on the part of the company.",Toshiba Satellite C55-B5270 Laptop PC - Intel Pentium N3530 2.16 GHz Quad-Core Processor - 8 GB DDR3L SDRAM - 500 GB Hard Drive - 15.6-inch Display - Windows 8.1 - Jet Black,$687.00
5,bri,"May 18, 2015",1.0 out of 5 stars,Has a Common Unfixable Hardware Issue - DO NOT BUY,"Was so excited for this laptop. 379 for 8gb of ram? Opened it Friday night, got all the settings just the way I wanted it, and settled in to play some  games. I'm very good with computers, and did not do anything to harm the hardware or software. Unfortunately, the next morning - less than twelve hours later - I logged onto my computer and in the middle of typing, some of the keys stopped working. E, T, Y, U, I, O, 1, 2, and the right 8 key, to be exact. If you Google this problem, many other users had the same issue, often with the same exact keys. The suggested fix is to take out your battery and put it back in. However, this requires unscrewing your computer and will void your warranty. Computers should work properly straight-out-of-the-box. I returned it, and got a Lenovo 6gb ram laptop for 329. Works like a dream. Will never buy Toshiba again.Notice: this is a SUPER COMMON problem with the Toshiba Satellites. DO NOT buy this computer. Don't scroll by this review and think ""it won't happen to me"". It can, and it probably will.

Sometimes it has strange glitches like buttons not working or programs not responding, but these go away when I reset.
