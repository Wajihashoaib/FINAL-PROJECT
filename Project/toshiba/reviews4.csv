0,LimonKay,"June 19, 2016",4.0 out of 5 stars,Upgrading from a previous Toshiba Satellite.,"After using this laptop for about two weeks now I feel confident in making a detailed summary.To start off, I'm someone who has been using another Toshiba Satellite (The p845t-s305) prior to this for 4 years and I've loved it dearly - it was the first laptop I purchased with my own money while working for it in high school. My previous one had a very nice silver finish that gave it a premium feel to it with lovely clear crisp Harman Kardon speakers.As for this laptop, I'm a full-time college student and an occasional gamer so I'm trying to supplement both when I purchased this.The laptop itself is pretty bulky, (6.2 lbs) can be a nuisance to hold onto if you're constantly walking through campus or work, also the 15.6"" screen is quite large, too large in fact to fit onto most university desks snug, if you're not careful you might actually drop it.The Harman Kardon speakers are not impressive at all, the sound is clear and crisp but not loud enough to actually give you a theater-like feel on a 4k display. My previous Toshiba Satellite speakers (also Harman Kardon) despite being a laptop $200 cheaper, they were so much louder.Although the 4k display is quite impressive, keep in mind MANY applications, programs, software haven't been integrated to work with 4k resolution as of date, so if you're like me you'll find playing some video games, and unbranded applications may be hard to look at as the text and windows may come out huge.The feel of the device is pretty cheap and the finish is nowhere near high quality, if I had to guess the price of this laptop just from appearances only without knowing a single spec of it, I'd say it's roughly something you'd find on the clearance aisle of Wal-Mart.Now with all the negatives aside, I am planning to keep this laptop as there as many positives to it as well.First and foremost, the back-lit keyboard is absolutely stunning. The battery life allows me to watch 2-3 episodes of Game of Thrones while waiting for my Japanese professor's lecture to end while she continues to rant about the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.The 12 GB ram is what really interested me in this laptop, that coupled with the intel i7 processor does make casual gaming a pleasant experience (League of Legends, Call of Duty run fine as long as you're not maxing out the settings, you'll get about 40-50 FPS). Don't expect this to run max settings without FPS drops and lags.The touchscreen is very responsive (the touchscreen on my previous laptop died after a year shortly so I'm still  a bit untrustworthy when it comes to this).Overall, for $700 you get a laptop with 12 GB ram, 1TB hard drive, intel i7 processor, a touchscreen with dual tablet mode on top of a 4k display resolution. Certainly beats your local BestBuy deal right?","Toshiba - Satellite Radius 2-in-1 15.6"" 4K Ultra HD Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 12GB Memory - 1TB Hard Drive - Carbon Gray",$649.00

3,Bob,"June 26, 2016",5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price, you ca't go wrong"," Hi There! This is a great Laptop and I love it. When I received this, I swapped the HDD to a OCZ SSD with the help of a professional. It is super fast and was working fine other than getting blacked out from time to time and then coming back to its senses by it self. But since, last week, I have been experiencing some sort of issue with the touch screen. All of a sudden few touch points start to appear on the screen and at times those points closer to the task bar self click n apps and start to open them. And at times, those points make the cursor point to lock on one of those touch points. Also at times it makes the screen zoom in and zoom out when we try to move the cursor arrow or touch the screen. Some times when you touch one of them points and move it around the issue goes away. The same happens when the laptop is restarted. but again those points start to appear after some time. I don't know how to make this stop. I'm hoping a software update will fix this issue. if anyone else had the same experience or know anything about this issue, please let me know how to fix it. I have also attached some images and a video clip for you to understand the issue. Thank you :)","Toshiba - Satellite Radius 2-in-1 15.6"" 4K Ultra HD Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 12GB Memory - 1TB Hard Drive - Carbon Gray",$649.00
4,Kimberly,"July 19, 2016",3.0 out of 5 stars,Constantly goes through set up.,"Updating review to three stars....After a headache of restarting the system, erasing half of the crap windows 10 has installed on it, cancelling background running programs and startup programs.... the computer works. I will not say perfect, but it works, at the moment it still crawls instead of running zipping through actions.We are keeping the computer, the speakers are amazing, the display is too, and we hope that eventually after we customize it all down to our liking *AKA stopping all those default things from W10 from popping up every five seconds* it will be the amazing computer we thought we bought.I hope this helps!For the moment One star.I did a lot of research before deciding on this computer, and my two previous laptops are Toshiba, immortals!The computer LOOKS amazing!... I admit... it has been used three-four times while trying to set up windows to my liking... and trying to get Office into it... the internet never works right... the computer worked fast the first day then became a slug after that....and today... It just woke up to a black screen of death... and it does nothing... I have contacted seller... depending on the outcome I will update my review. I really WANT this computer...","Toshiba - Satellite Radius 2-in-1 15.6"" 4K Ultra HD Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 12GB Memory - 1TB Hard Drive - Carbon Gray",$649.00
5,Savan,"August 26, 2016",3.0 out of 5 stars,display is nice but complicate to handle it,"Ok, I am going to try and explain to anyone who may be interested in buying this laptop why I feel it’s a good deal. Some of you really need to understand what a deal this is and why some people are having issues.I have had this laptop for a month now and I have not had any issues because, I knew what I was buying. You see, either a laptop or desktop will only be as fast as its slowest component. Yes, this thing has a great processor, lots of memory, great 4K graphics but, the hard drive is only a 5400 rpm. We’re talking 1990s technology, that’s why this laptop is so SLOW. Sure, it’s a lot of storage but, the factory installed hard drive, is not meant for speed. Also, seeing the hard drive is the slowest component, it can create some problems for all of the better components.Now, I went to Best Buy to check this thing out and theirs had the same specs overall except theirs had a 128gb ssd drive, it was fast but, they also wanted over $1, 000. So, I found this one on here for 7 something and figured by adding a faster ssd drive by myself, I could have a very nice 4K laptop for under $850. After I put in my new ssd drive, this thing flies, boots fast, files run fast, browsing is faster and no issues loading programs. Just remember to clone your factory drive to your new ssd before you swap them. Trust me I needed to load Office 365 before I got my new drive and it took 4hrs to get it loaded, what a pain.Plain English, you’re buying a formula one race car that has a lawn mower engine part that’s slowing it down, just upgrade the hard drive and own an awesome 4K laptop, It’s worth it. Even if you installed a 7200rpm drive in this laptop, it would still be worth it.","Toshiba - Satellite Radius 2-in-1 15.6"" 4K Ultra HD Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 12GB Memory - 1TB Hard Drive - Carbon Gray",$649.00

The next day I went to turn it on and it went back to the set up screen. Ok I'll set it up again. Same thing every time it shuts down. I had to return it for another one and hopefully that will work because the computer was awesome while it worked.UPDATE: Second computer came with a defective screen. It had a large bright green spot in the corner and a large cloud of dead pixles in the center. Hopefully the third times a charm because I really like this computer.","Toshiba - Satellite Radius 2-in-1 15.6"" 4K Ultra HD Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 12GB Memory - 1TB Hard Drive - Carbon Gray",$649.00

Do not look at performance because it is so slow startup takes about 4 to 5 minute to start. And main issue with its charger. My charger is burning of even for 15 min uses.

8,Yazmin Z. Armstrong,"June 20, 2016",1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible computers,This is a excellent laptop! Beautiful 4k display quality. Full size on screen keyboard works great & I use that the most. Very well constructed with the aluminum caseing but can be scratched so I suggest getting a adhesive case protected plus a screen scratch protecter. Very easy to setup especially if you already r using windows10 on another device. Also purchased the wireless display adapter for tv.s but an HDMI cord will work just as well maybe even BETTER because of no connection issues! So over all with the specs of this pc & the $ it's on sale for is something that is hard to come but. So if your lucky enuff to get one of these for 700$ there is no way you won't be extremely happy with it!!,"Toshiba - Satellite Radius 2-in-1 15.6"" 4K Ultra HD Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 12GB Memory - 1TB Hard Drive - Carbon Gray",$649.00

10,Jessica Biloxi,"June 22, 2016",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Slow, bloated, buggy hot mess","I will be returning this today. I was so excited about the 4K display, i7, massive amounts of RAM, and storage. This thing is 10x slower than the Windows 7 machine with i3 and 4GB RAM that I was replacing (glad I kept it!). Buggy from the start. Would black screen or enter recovery mode on every restart or opening the lid from sleep. And it's just soooo slow. Boot time is ridiculous. Opening Word takes 2 minutes. The only 2 things I installed on the machine were Chrome and Office. Even after removing the bloat and trying various 'speed up Windows 10' tweaks, no luck. Tried a reset twice with no luck. Now it refuses to enter Recovery mode, so I can't even delete my private data before I return it.

Unfortunately had to do a business trip and death in family, long story short it was quite a while down the road when I went back to it. Screen went out  and upon trouble shooting found to be a video card the is built in to motherboard meaning also unable to run via HDMI and was unable to use after that.

42,Amazon Customer,"February 9, 2016",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great laptop overall,"This laptop is probably a little more than what the average college or high school student might need. I have to do a lot of data entry for work so the number key pad is a necessity for me. I also do a lot of split screen work so it really helps having the 15.6” display. If you run a lot of programs at once, I’d recommend this laptop considering it has a 12GB ram. Ultimately, this laptop is a good fit for someone who does a lot of multitasking, runs a lot of programs at once, and wants a computer with full functionality and a crystal clear display.I rate this product a four out of five stars. It has a sleek design, feels light weight yet strong, and has by far the best display I have yet to see on a laptop. The touch screen is a nice feature plus being able to flip the screen all the way around. I also like that the keyboard automatically lights up when you start typing or press a key. It times out after a little bit to help conserve battery life. For me, the 12GB Ram is a big plus since I have a lot of programs running at the same time. I can’t imagine I’ll ever run out of memory either considering it has a terabyte to work with. The battery on this laptop seems about the same as others I have used. It usually lasts 4 to 6 hours, just depends what you’re doing.  I’d also recommend a warranty or accidental drop plan if available. The whole bottom is sealed up so no replacing batteries yourself on this one.When I first got the laptop a couple weeks ago I had problems with the display driver restarting quite a bit and the touch pad for the mouse would become unresponsive at times. The computer has downloaded numerous updates since I bought it and all the bugs seems to have worked out since then.If it wasn’t for the problems right away I’d give it five stars. It’s very frustrating paying a lot of money for what I consider an above-average quality laptop and having performance and operating issues from the get-go. Overall, the pros definitely out-weigh the cons and I would recommend this to a friend. Just be aware you might have to do some updates before you get to use your new laptop with its 4K high resolution touch-screen display.","Toshiba - Satellite Radius 2-in-1 15.6"" 4K Ultra HD Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 12GB Memory - 1TB Hard Drive - Carbon Gray",$649.00
43,John P. Cloninger,"November 1, 2016",4.0 out of 5 stars,and all has been great since. Just a warning about 4K displays,"I'm going to go four stars. I got a factory refurb from MicroCenter in Paterson, NJ, so I only paid $579. It was a huge risk, but it has worked out very well!It almost had to go back after a month because as I was removing all of that pre-installed software, and configuring all kinds of other stuff, I somehow corrupted Win10. But somehow I managed to get that fixed, and all has been great since.Just a warning about 4K displays...to get your settings to a tolerable compromise between icon size, font size, app size, etc. takes some time to fine tune. It can be very frustrating, especially when the OS was being fooled with a lot. I've landed at a happy medium.Battery life is awful. Know that in advance. That's probably what keeps me from saying five stars.I rarely use the tablet mode, but it's a nice to have in some situations. I think I've been in tablet mode around 2% of the time. I think of this more as a desktop replacement than a 2-in-1. I have a 10"" Verizon tablet, and so if I want a tablet experience, I go for that instead. Both fit in my gig bag just fine, so it's not a big deal.It seems like a risky purchase, but mine has been fantastic...I lost my last Toshiba after about six years of heavy use, including me replacing the HD once, the screen once, three keyboards, etc. That's not because the build quality was poor...it was that I smashed the screen, poured drinks into the KB, and just wanted a bigger HD. It's why I bought Toshiba again. I have the ability to do laptop surgery on a whim, so I'm not afraid.Recommended, but only for the right person.","Toshiba - Satellite Radius 2-in-1 15.6"" 4K Ultra HD Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 12GB Memory - 1TB Hard Drive - Carbon Gray",$649.00
44,Amazon Customer,"December 13, 2016",3.0 out of 5 stars,It would be perfect if the glass were 100% clean,"After replacing the HDD with an SSD, the performance is very good.The 4k resolution delivers impressive fine traces, but it is extremely unfortunate that the quality of the 4k resolution is overshadowed by the poor quality of the screen glass, which is not 100% clean, has small glossy lozenges, which are mostly visible on the white background. If it were not for this, this laptop would be perfect.[Sorry for my english, not speak english]","Toshiba - Satellite Radius 2-in-1 15.6"" 4K Ultra HD Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 12GB Memory - 1TB Hard Drive - Carbon Gray",$649.00

46,DWARAKA NATH ACHARYA,"September 4, 2017",1.0 out of 5 stars,Defective model and spurious product with no support from Manufacturer,"Do not buy this  defective laptop. I purchased from Best Buy store at Manchester vide bill 0484 070 8110 DATED 4/20/16.

47,Jake Guello,"August 11, 2016",4.0 out of 5 stars,I like this computer,"I like this computer. Like others are saying on here the hard drive is very slow, and i plan to upgrade to a SSD. The 4k screen is almost overkill. This is just to small of a screen to take advantage of the full 4k experience. That being said, videos look amazing and the touch screen foldy part of the computer is very cool. I wish it had more ports on, but oh well.","Toshiba - Satellite Radius 2-in-1 15.6"" 4K Ultra HD Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 12GB Memory - 1TB Hard Drive - Carbon Gray",$649.00

49,Sam Yungman,"August 14, 2016",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Was great, but now not.","If you don't have any problems with this computer it is great, but once you start having problems it is awful.  There was something wrong internally in my computer so I sent it off to Toshiba.  Then, the screen got cracked during shipping.  Toshiba refused to fix the screen and the internal problem and would not even file a claim.  This computer was good for the 3 months it lasted, but it was not worth the but because of the trouble I had to deal with from the company.  I really hope someone else doesn't have to go through the same month process I had to.","Toshiba - Satellite Radius 2-in-1 15.6"" 4K Ultra HD Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 12GB Memory - 1TB Hard Drive - Carbon Gray",$649.00
