0,Jackson,"August 22, 2021",1.0 out of 5 stars,The volume is not loud enough to hear well.,"I purchased this for my parents a month ago. When we set it up everything appeared to worked however we did not investigate the volume. I am visiting again and see that the volume is very very soft on this laptop making movies/videos very hard to hear.After troubleshooting with Microsoft and Toshiba's support for many, many hours (and it is almost impossible to get a hold of someone at Toshiba - their auto-phone system sends you in circles), I was instructed to ship the unit back. At this point- after all the testing (reinstalling of Windows) the computer would enter the blue screen of death mode. Then after 6 weeks without the unit, I received the following message. ""This is Dynabook repair service center (Bizcom Electronics Inc.)Thanks for giving the opportunity to server you. Pls refer to the diagnosis result and repairing log of your unit TC-10664080 as below.1.  The SSD in the unit is defective after tested and verified;2.  The SSD was installed by the 3rd party, which is outside of Toshiba’s warranty.3.  Except the defective SSD, the unit functions properly;Please understand that we provide IN Warranty repairing services to all Dynabook’s Laptops; however, your unit due to the failed SSD from 3rd party is not covered by Toshiba’s warranty service.
