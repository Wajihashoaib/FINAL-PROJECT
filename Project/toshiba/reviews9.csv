0,Clay,"December 18, 2015",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great machine with a bad track pad that is easily fixed.,"I've only had this laptop for a couple of weeks now, but so far I am enjoying it. I haven't put it through any strenuous tasks yet, just lots of video streaming and some basic picture/gif editing, but it seems to be quick enough and operates smoothly. There was one annoyance right out of the box that almost made me send it back the next day: the touch pad was very glitchy, delayed and sometimes completely unresponsive. However, a quick google search led me to instructions on how to fix the problem myself. All I had to do was uninstall the touch pad driver, then download and reinstall the current driver from Toshiba's website. It didn't take very long at all and now the touch pad works fine. That and the bloatware, which is to be expected on pretty much all pre-built computers these days, are my only gripes so far.The display is great. I was somewhat against getting a touchscreen laptop at first but it has turned out to be pretty handy, I like it. The tablet mode is cool as well for relaxing on the couch and watching videos. I also find the backlit keyboard to be a nice feature in the dark.The sound quality is quite noticeable. These speakers are crystal clear even at high volumes, and they get LOUD.The overall build quality seems sturdy. It feels like a well-built machine despite the plastic casing. I think they could have used a matte finish instead of glossy to give it an aluminum-like feel and gotten away with it just fine, though.The SSD is small, and I bought this with the anticipation that I will likely upgrade to a larger SSD in the future. I read that it is much cheaper to buy a laptop with a small SSD and upgrade than it is to buy one with a large SSD already built in, which makes sense. I will say, though, that the SSD is considerably faster than most standard hard drives when it comes to start-up and opening programs. This computer restarts super quickly, which is nice.So if you're like me and just want a fast computer that's great for media and basic photo editing, this is definitely one to consider.",Toshiba Satellite Fusion 15 L55W-C5259 15.6-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Laptop,$439.00
1,Rajkh,"October 21, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the price,"As you can see most of the reviews are from vine customers of free product and many freezeup complaints. So was skeptical at first to buy this laptop, but after a month of using it I would say it is a great buy at this price.The bootup is super fast due to SSD. Regarding the 128GB SSD,  people need to understand the difference between SSD and HDD. SSD is faster and hence costly! If you want higher memory space you could pay less for HDD and get a slower laptop. This laptop is not for storage! If you want to store your pictures you can use various cloud services out there like amazon's own photos app which comes free with prime membership or google photos both of which offers unlimited storage.Downloads are fast due to 802.11ac and there is no hangup while downloads like mentioned in other reviews. As with the touchpad freezing, I have had no such issues. Few times I thought I had the trackpad issues I had disabled the touchpad control by clicking on the F5 function key which doubles as enable/disable the touchpad. Probably you are trying to refresh the page with the function keys like you are used to in desktop keyboard and disabled the touchpad. In fact I dont use the touchpad much, if I have issues with touchpad I use the touchscreen. Keyboard is sleek macbook like and doesnt make much noise which I love. Backlight is cool but I am unable to find options to turn it off during day when it isn't needed -- found that FN+Z can be used for turning backlight on and off .Windows 10 isn't much different. Cortana voice assistant opens only in build apps and not the ones you download. Most of the search redirects to Bing.Display is beautiful and 4K videos does play, its little jittery when playing fast paced songs. I think can't expect much from the i5 processor or mobile hd graphics. I am not a gamer, so cannot comment on gaming experience.Audio wise it isn't good as beats as in my other hp laptop.Heavy for a tablet but can be propped up or folded on a table and can be used for long hours.Regarding the tablet mode change complaint that it doesnt work, It asks whether you want to exit/enter tablet mode and also whether you want to 'Always ask before changing' or 'Remember my decision'. I chose remember and it does remember.Doesn't heat up much. Only complaint I have which others have already mentioned is opening the laptop is a hassle.",Toshiba Satellite Fusion 15 L55W-C5259 15.6-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Laptop,$439.00
2,JSE,"October 9, 2015",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall, very nice upgrade from laptops in 2012.","It's a really nice laptop. I was hesitant about Windows 10, being a Windows 7 user prior to the upgrade. But friends and my bf suggested that I need to just engage with it and get used to it. The screen is clear and large. The 360 function is pretty cool. I like how the fan is in the back instead of the bottom. The cord is nice and small, but can heat up a lot. I wish the sleeping function would last longer. Meaning I could leave it for 24 hours still on sleep then just hit my space ar and it would turn back on again. Instead I have to use the power button every single time. Which i don't like to do, because I fear of wearing it out. I have to turn it on and off multiple times a day since I use it for classes and work. I love the keyboard; it's smooth to type on, and so far pretty easy to clean.What I don't like about it, is that the edges of the laptop base itself (on the side of the mouse pad), has a rubbery lip, that is kind of uncomfortable to rest my forearms on, while i type. Which I type for long periods of time, doing research, papers, or taking lecture notes.The other thing I don't like about it, is the fact that it's not very easy to open it from the closed position. I have to angle it in a way where gravity will help it open, then carefully pry the two edges apart. My last laptop had a little lip that I could easily push on to open it. But that must be because of the 360 design...Overall, a wonderful upgrade from my Lenovo I've had for 4 years.",Toshiba Satellite Fusion 15 L55W-C5259 15.6-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Laptop,$439.00
3,Paul M.,"March 11, 2017",3.0 out of 5 stars,Great computer but unreliable hardware and supply chain.,"There are some great things about this computer.  Lightweight, fast great screen.  I still wouldn't buy it again and will buy from a different manufacturer.At just less than a year old, it crashed and I had to reload it.  I didn't lose any data since I keep everything in the cloud but had to reload programs and set everything up again.At a year and a half old, the battery died.  It had been fine, then it quit working.  The laptop worked fine when plugged into a power receptacle. Ok, it happens, so I started searching the web for a replacement and couldn't find one.  I checked with my  local computer store and they could only find one at a sketchy website, so I called Toshiba.  They referred me to their parts supplier, who told me they don't sell those batteries. I called the company they suggested, a large tech parts supplier and they had one....but it would take almost a month to get it.  Ok fine, I'll wait.At a month since I ordered the battery, I got a notice today that it's been back ordered from the manufacturer and there's no estimate on when it will be available.If you buy this computer, be ready for it to become a desktop. I expected better from Toshiba.",Toshiba Satellite Fusion 15 L55W-C5259 15.6-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Laptop,$439.00
4,Reviewer,"April 6, 2016",5.0 out of 5 stars,SSD is IT!!!!,"I've had this product now for more than 6 months.This was a replacement upgrade for another Windows 10 laptop (that used to run Windows 7)SSD was a MUST and the deal make or breaker -- along with quad core i5 and 6GB minimum RAM which is pretty standard on most laptops.  SSD was not...The other requirement was FLEXIBILITY in usage from classical latptop, to touchscreen laptop, to full tablet.The other underlying requirement was a top tier brand.  For me this means: HP, Toshiba, Dell, Lenovo in this product class and in that order of preference based on previous purchases both professionally and personally.Price was the other measure and deal maker.  This Toshiba with the latest SSD fit the bill.SUPER FAST product because of the SSD mainly.  Gorgeous screen and keyboard. Fun to type on actually.  Excellent battery life. Many think it's an Apple Mac....I do NOT recommend that one buys anything without SSD.  This IS your purchase measuring stick that would really be noticeable in terms of speed performance and how long your storage drive would last.  Look ma, no spinning mechanical device!Only con but is livable... wish Toshiba shipped a model with a LARGER SSD drive, but price point would have been a problem at the time of purchase. The good news is that SSD prices have fallen since then.5 stars for this product.  5 stars for Toshiba.  And of course, 5 stars for Amazon.",Toshiba Satellite Fusion 15 L55W-C5259 15.6-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Laptop,$439.00
5,Angeline I. Olliff,"January 21, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,My favorite piece of tech machinery!,"This is by far my most prized possession (excepting my recent auto buy). It's beautiful, and for a l5+in. screen, it's lightweight and easy to use both as a tablet and actually a top my lap.I've had it for a full year now and still 100% recomend it.One noteworthy annoyance: one day about 3 months ago, it failed to start. Not only that, but it also had zero responsiveness--no charging light, no whirring sounds, no keyboard light, not even a flicker of life on the screen. After researching and trying every troubleshooting strategy offered by Google & Toshiba, I got through to cust.srv. @Toshiba. They then asked me to re-do those measures in case I'm an idiot, all to no avail. Next was a $30 fee for a special box in which I would send the device to their Tennessee warehouse for inspection. This was stressful a) bc Toshiba wasn't clear about warranty coverage/exclusion, b) their site implied I'd be charged for the call!, and c) it took 2-3weeks to get it back, all the while playing phone tag w/reps. The final correspondence amounted to this:""When I pressed the power button, it turned on. We are now returning your device.""So, I'm out $30. It hasn't recurred. Fingers crossed. And the lesson: Keep the original packaging & don't heed the suggestion to purchase a fancy shipping box if this happens to you.One other problem: when switching to tablet mode, it is often slow to deactive the physical keyboard.I still love this thing.",Toshiba Satellite Fusion 15 L55W-C5259 15.6-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Laptop,$439.00
6,Amazon Customer,"November 15, 2015",4.0 out of 5 stars,Fn keys hard to use,"I liked this PC when it arrived. It's a beautiful machine. I started using it, browsing web pages, and soon had a few open for various sites.I went to do my usual thing, and use Alt/F4 to close some down, when I couldn't see any Fn keys on the top row.The keys that would normally be F1, F2, F3, etc., weren't there, as far as I could tell.I did a quick search on the internet, and found that someone had the same issue. That person pointed out that the keys are lettered as F1, F2, etc.,, but in tiny lettering on the corner of the keycaps, in a faint, brownish color. So is the Fn shift key at the bottom of the keyboard.I took the Toshiba to the daylight at the window and, sure enough, the tiny lettering was there as described.But I use Fn keys a lot, and usually in a low light setting. And the keyboard backlighting, while fine for the main keyboard, is no help for the Fn keys.Maybe one could get used to the relative position of the keys, but why put up with that?I returned the item reluctantly.Otherwise, seems to be a fine laptop.",Toshiba Satellite Fusion 15 L55W-C5259 15.6-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Laptop,$439.00
7,Judson911,"January 1, 2020",4.0 out of 5 stars,Helpful battery replacement,"I should've purchased a new battery a few years ago. Basically this has been hooked up to an electrical cord a year after i bought it. I love this laptop and was hoping I could find a battery. The Toshiba site wasn't any help.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Y7RMS16/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1Easy battery to install. Remove all screws on the back, including the screws on the black hinge. Then remove battery and plug this one in. Remember to look at colors of previous plug wires before removing. Replace all screws and let charge. No tech here. Super easy and $500+ cheaper than buying a new touchscreen laptop. The only downfall of this unit is the battery.

8,Wrench,"October 21, 2018",3.0 out of 5 stars,Fine 2 in 1 BUT::,"When I purchased this Toshiba in 2015, I was a little skeptical about the runt ssd.  If you have small plans for software, it's o.k., but, if have several productivity programs in mind, forget it.  Recently, the pad has developed a mind of its own.  It started it's own nasty little habit of opening files/directories with just a split second of a hover.  Try as I may, I haven't found a work around for that.  And, it could be quite a pain in the you know what.  Been building desktops since dos, but this is my first laptop.  Just ordered a Dell Inspirion with a 1t ssd.  Hopefully soon, no more worries.Overall I've been satisfied with this Toshiba, but those are two pretty serious snafus.",Toshiba Satellite Fusion 15 L55W-C5259 15.6-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Laptop,$439.00

10,Scott,"October 24, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great!,"Great! This is a terrific laptop for general use. I don't game but I use it for general computing and for astrophotgraphy software. Windows 10 is pretty nice, fast and seems reliable. The SSD makes the laptop very quick and I ordered an external DVD drive for when the kids want to watch an older movie that we don't have digitally. The screen is nice and crisp, bright enough and looks great. Keyboard is backlit, I've never had that before so I really like that too. The only complaint I have is that there is an edge where you place your wrists and it digs into your arms. I've adjusted my typing style, but sometime when surfing the net I catch myself letting my arms press down on the keyboard ledge and it gets uncomfortable. Not enough to knock a star off. It's a great value for the money. I got the i5 SSD model. Worth every penny.",Toshiba Satellite Fusion 15 L55W-C5259 15.6-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Laptop,$439.00
11,Tim Gier,"December 22, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,Lots of power & features for the price.,"This is a very good mid-level computer. The i5 chip coupled with 8GB or RAM will handle just about everything that a home user can throw at it - I suspect that if a person wants to do professional-level video editing or AutoCad type work that something beefier would be in order. But for everyday use, this thing is great. The SSD drive is quiet and the computer doesn't run hot or noisy at all. The touch screen is accurate (although it is a fingerprint magnet) and the versatility of the 360 degree hinge makes it fantastic for watching movies or video clips. I like the size because it has a full-sized keyboard with separate number pad - the whole keyboard is backlit.Sound is pretty good, although I admit that I'm not the best judge of high-fidelity. You could easily spend hundreds of dollars more and not get anything much more useful for everyday home computing.",Toshiba Satellite Fusion 15 L55W-C5259 15.6-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Laptop,$439.00

Mine is pretty gently used, but used daily, and I have no real complaints. Love the touchscreen, don't use the flip-to-tablet much though. I had to adjust the touchpad settings because it was over-responding, but that's fine now, too. I love the back-lit keyboard; much easier to use in the dark. I did get a 128GB thumb drive to help with the drive capacity, so no complaints there either; I love having an SSD for my main drive.

Then about 2 years later the whole thing died and i hardly ever used it. While i don't expect a laptop that sees daily use to last more than 4 years, this wasn't something i used on the daily and mainly used it for travel, which was quite rare.

I purchased this 2 in 1 laptop on Sept 14, 2015 with great expectations. The computer is now totally unusable. There is a conflict between the Synaptics Touchpad driver and Windows 10. As the computer heats up the mouse cursor jumps all over the screen without any input from me. It seems to favor the lower left corner and clicks on the start menu. The screen zooms in and out and applications open and close. It is impossible to stop. I have tried everything, uninstalling the driver, checking for viruses, reinstalling Windows. Everything to no avail. Google ""erratic mouse/cursor movement"" and Synaptic's name comes up.I strongly recommend you look for a different computer.",Toshiba Satellite Fusion 15 L55W-C5259 15.6-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Laptop,$439.00

In addition to this, the wifi never worked properly. Any time the computer went into sleep mode I would have to manually disconnect and reconnect to the router or it wouldn't work.
