0,TH,"April 15, 2014",4.0 out of 5 stars,Mostly Good ... So Far,"The laptop works well.  Using VMware Player I created a Fedora VM with 2 GB of RAM.  The VM response time is good.  SQL Server installed and is running good too.  Nothing flaky so far with the processor, motherboard or memory.  It has been running without any problems.  No replaceable battery but the laptop is half the width of a laptop with a removable battery.  My only objection so far is that the touchpad right click button is a barely visible continuation of the bottom of the touchpad.  And its difficult to click.  Toshiba obviously went back and tried to reduce the manufacturing costs and I dont mind most of the cuts except the touchpad buttons.  Engineering made that part too cheap and the buttons just dont work well.This comes with Windows 8 not Windows 8 Pro. The difference is that you cannot join it to a domain nor does it have the option to install Microsoft Hyper-v. Although that is a easy $100 upgrade to Pro. Office is not installed either so that is another $100.","Toshiba Satellite L55-A5284 15.6-Inch Laptop (1.8 GHz Intel Core i5-3337U Processor, 8GB DIMM, 750GB HDD, Windows 8) Mercury Silver",$725.00
1,Klassy,"December 27, 2013",5.0 out of 5 stars,It is what we thought it would be....,"I bought this laptop for my wife who teaches in higher education.  She has to be on the computer a lot to edit papers from students to posting comments and grades through blackboard.  She has a lot of windows open at any given time and needs to work at a nice pace.  I needed something with a lot of memory and a good processor.  This computer seems to be the one that can handle anything that you dish out at it.  Many people on this site and other sites  talks about Windows 8 which has nothing to do with the computer itself.  Windows 8 is different I get it but it isn't the end of the world.  It gets easier after awhile.  This computer was rated very good in the Consumer Report magazine as a good budget laptop.  That kind of sold me. The only con is that is doesn't come loaded with Microsoft Office, which can be pricey but we get a discount working in education so it isn't a issue but it can be depending on your situation.","Toshiba Satellite L55-A5284 15.6-Inch Laptop (1.8 GHz Intel Core i5-3337U Processor, 8GB DIMM, 750GB HDD, Windows 8) Mercury Silver",$725.00
2,Essmay,"April 18, 2015",1.0 out of 5 stars,Be aware,"I have spoken with two Toshiba representatives today in regards to my new lap top I purchased in November 2014. Satellite L55-A5284. The device started to have horizontal gray lines appearing across the screen. It started with 2, now there are 3. When I called the first customer support number 1-800-513-9578 FREE I spoke with a male representative who was very rude on the phone. He said I quote "" I am not asking you, I am telling you there is a physical damage to the device"" and proceeded to insinuate that the device was dropped or that something heavy was placed on the top of it, going as far as telling me that there is a crack in the screen.1. The screen is not cracked !2. The device was not dropped !3. There was never put anything heavy on the top of the device !4. The lap top remains inside the house on the desk for 98% of the time and few times that it was taken out, it securely traveled inside a bag.5. This problem started about 2 days ago and it seems to be getting worse.When I called the second customer service number 1-800-457-7777 FREE, I spoke with a female representative who tried to be very helpful but really could not do anything but give me a case number and tell me that some one will be getting in touch with me. I still have to receive a phone call or an e-mail.I am very disappointed with the product and even more with Toshiba's customer service. I own HP lap top that I had for 3 + years. My old HP computer didn't have any of the issues my new Toshiba device currently struggles with. Judging by my recent experiences with that brand I should have never considered switching to Toshiba!","Toshiba Satellite L55-A5284 15.6-Inch Laptop (1.8 GHz Intel Core i5-3337U Processor, 8GB DIMM, 750GB HDD, Windows 8) Mercury Silver",$725.00
3,CeCe,"November 13, 2013",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not A Happy Camper,"I've had nothing but trouble with this product. Don't know if most of it is because of the horrible Windows 8 (now 8.1) operating system or the laptop itself, but I would NOT recommend buying this product. Although there is a full keyboard, I find the touch not particularly user friendly for older adults. I get frequent error messages that my wireless internet is not connected, which is very frustrating as I end up losing the web page I was on. Funny that this doesn't happen with my iPhone or iPad and didn't happen with my old Windows XP laptop. Windows 8 does not support Comcast email unless you go to it through Outlook or use the Comcast Xfinity website, which if I knew beforehand, I would not have purchased any computer with Windows 8. I do most everything on my iPad except some ongoing word processing projects that I need a laptop for. With the computer you get a one-month free subscription to Office 365, which took me a week to figure out how to access because the program and any documents you create are in the Cloud. I could go on and on but let it suffice that I am not happy with my purchase. My advice is to start saving your money and buy Apple products!","Toshiba Satellite L55-A5284 15.6-Inch Laptop (1.8 GHz Intel Core i5-3337U Processor, 8GB DIMM, 750GB HDD, Windows 8) Mercury Silver",$725.00
4,CindyR,"April 12, 2014",1.0 out of 5 stars,Froze up within the first 5 minutes,"I got this laptop after seeing it at Staples for $75 more and they didn't even have it in stock. Amazon shipped it in 2 days, perfectly as usual.  Out of the box,  I set it up following the quick start guide and signed in only to see a blank gray screen.  I called Toshiba and could tell by their attitude they could care less and wanted me to pay for support.  Finally, after several on/off and reboots, it worked. Oh, and you cannot take the battery out of this computer, its locked inside.  When the screen came up I saw that Windows 8 is bizarre.  Microsoft is trying to be like Apple but it is not working for them.  Read about it before you get a laptop with it.  I have a MAC and I was used to Windows Vista.  Windows 8 is nothing like either of them.  I felt lost and although I am not an IT person, I can usually find my way around a computer.  So,  after this first night I thought more about it and called Amazon the next day for a return.  It was no problem to send it back.  I ended up getting a laptop with Windows 7.  Much better!","Toshiba Satellite L55-A5284 15.6-Inch Laptop (1.8 GHz Intel Core i5-3337U Processor, 8GB DIMM, 750GB HDD, Windows 8) Mercury Silver",$725.00

I just started college and have already used the laptop quite a bit. It has a great battery life and is fairly lightweight. The things that I like the most about the laptop are: it has an Intel i5 processor, it has two USB 3.0 ports and a USB 2.0 port, it includes an HDMI out connection, and it has a disc drive.
