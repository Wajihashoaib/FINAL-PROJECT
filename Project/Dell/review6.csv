4,ppa,"June 13, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,I highly recommend this touchscreen laptop,"I purposely included the word touchscreen in the title because it is a “touchscreen” laptop. I’ve seen some confusion about that in some of the comments. This is a “touchscreen” laptop. I purchased the brand-new version. Used ones are being sold. I bought the new computer. Now be-clear: this is a highly exceptional deal. Value for the money in my opinion is beyond comparison. 16 GB of ram, 128 SSD Drive with one terabyte of HDD, touchscreen tablet, 15.6 inch screen - this is an amazing deal for the price. It’s fast, very very very fast. That’s because of the 16 GB of RAM and the SSD drive. If you don’t know about SSD drive, you want that. It makes the computer Boot up much faster.  This computer actually has two hard drives. It uses the SSD to Boot Up and store data, it’s a solid component and boot up is amazingly fast  it also has 1 TB HDD This computer will last me a very long time. Before I made my purchase I had looked at (I.e., studied for months ) several different Dell laptops. I have an older Dell laptop, it needed replacing. It did not qualify gor Windows 11 upgrade and was getting slower by the hour.  For the speed, the ram, the duel drives, and all of the storage this compares verifiably to the XPS class of dell computer. This laptop comes with Windows 10, but upgrades to Windows 11 upon setup. Computer will remind you to run all the updates for the Dell computer. Once the computer is set up you will see a prompt make sure you run them. Anyway, I strongly recommend purchasing this computer. This is an excellent price for a very very very good computer. Frankly, this is a steal. I’m not a Dell or Amazon employee - just an Amazon prime customer that’s very happy with this purchase of my new laptop. I highly recommend this computer. Once again, I bought the new laptop and not the used laptop.","2021 Newest Dell Inspiron 15 3000 3501 Laptop, 15.6"" Full HD 1080P Screen, 11th Gen Intel Core i5-1135G7 Quad-Core Processor, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD + 1TB HDD, Webcam, HDMI, Wi-Fi, Windows 10 Home, Black",&679

6,Amazon Customer,"June 18, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Poor performance from the unit and Dell support,"First of all, this review is for my specific model, 2.8GHz I5, SSD+Mech drive, no touchscreen, Amazon combines similar product reviews.  This product had either systemic problem or was defective leading to poor performance, and it was returned.  The nitty gritty is below, but the executive summary is the processor was locked at 0.4GHz, one sixth it's rating.  Imagine buying a Ferrari capable of 240 MPH, and when it arrived it was governed to 40MPH.  I was hoping to work through the issues with dell, but when they turned the tables asking for payment to support a brand new unit, i thought they deserved it back.I spent about 10 hours trying to fix this.  I narrowed it down to the processor thinking it was dissipating 85 watts, which would be a remarkable feat, since the power adapter is only 65 watts.  The speedshift power saving in the chip figures it would be burning up (even though the temps were fine), so it throttled to min speed.  When I was ready to give up I figured I'd call dell.  The level one tech did find a driver or two that the update drivers tool did not find, and he installed them over a period of 90 minutes.  When this did not fix it, he told me he would send an email that would allow me to have a 'software specialist' work on it.  I got the email and it requires a $100 payment prior to the work beginning, are you kidding Dell, I just bought the thing!  So, they got their speed locked and .4GHz product back.","2021 Newest Dell Inspiron 15 3000 3501 Laptop, 15.6"" Full HD 1080P Screen, 11th Gen Intel Core i5-1135G7 Quad-Core Processor, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD + 1TB HDD, Webcam, HDMI, Wi-Fi, Windows 10 Home, Black",&679
