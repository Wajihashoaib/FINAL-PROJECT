0,Cthulhu_013,"August 11, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,It's ok.,"Very lightweight and portable. Works fine and seems to be decent quality. Downsides are the touch pad doesn't work well (very little control, cursor goes everywhere) which means you need to buy a Bluetooth enabled mouse. It doesn't work well with my HP printer. It honestly sees the printer as a virus. Had to buy a different printer. Also, battery life is lacking. It drains quickly even when. Laptop is off.  If had to purchase again I would have gone with a bigger more powerful laptop.","Dell Inspiron 13 5310, 13.3 inch QHD (Quad High Definition) Laptop - Thin and Light Intel Core i7-11370H, 16GB DDR4 RAM, 512GB SSD, NVIDIA GeForce MX450, Dell Services - Windows 10 Home",&585
1,Eduardo Paz,"August 10, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Decepcionado,"This product is promoted as a laptop with a long battery life, at most it is really 4 hours of normal use such as viewing social networks, videos and zoom. An important detail is that fingerprint recognition fails quite a bit, and the worst thing is the definitely bad trackpad (mouse). It stays stuck at all times. All this combined makes for a lackluster user experience.--------------------------------Se promociona este producto como una portátil con batería de larga vida, a lo sumo son 4 horas realmente de uso normal como ser ver redes sociales, videos y zoom. Un detalle importante es que falla bastante el reconocimiento de la huella dactilar, y lo peor es el trackpad (mouse) definitivamente malo, no hay otra forma de exponerlo. Se queda pegado a cada momento.

3,C. A. Hauer,"October 24, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Satisfied with purchase,"When I was deciding on which laptop to buy, well, I read the feedback. First, this is not a gamer laptop, I don't think it's even advertised as such. So, I discounted all the unhappy gamers that were unwilling to dig into their pockets to buy a laptop geared to gaming and instead bought this one, only to be unhappy with the results of their own poor judgement, then proceed to blame the laptop. Moving along. I run my business from my laptop. Thats what the laptop is geared for, business (or personal) use. Excellent graphics. I run my website and accounting software on it, no issues. It's compact, seems fairly sturdy, keyboard is backlit and is a nice size for such a small laptop. My only complaints with this laptop are the battery, like I wish it held a charge longer, but this seems to be an issue with most laptops. I also have a hard time plugging in my USB drive, it does fit in there, but it's a struggle. But overall, I'm very happy with this laptop. 16g ram, i7 processor (11th gen), adequate storage.","Dell Inspiron 13 5310, 13.3 inch QHD (Quad High Definition) Laptop - Thin and Light Intel Core i7-11370H, 16GB DDR4 RAM, 512GB SSD, NVIDIA GeForce MX450, Dell Services - Windows 10 Home",&585
4,Miguel Ramos Núñez,"July 7, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good budget ultralight laptop,"Overall, I think this is a good quality budget ultralight. I use it as an ancillary computer at work. On battery, it averages about 8 hrs of continuous use ( I use the balanced power mode), which is mostly web browsing, and checking emails. I have not tried out the camera since I hardly ever use it; I like the idea of the sliding cover. The small footprint and 16:10 aspect are perfect for transporting in a backpack and viewing pdf files. The keyboard and trackpad are the weakest components  of this laptop but I use an external mouse and most typing is done on the desktop. The overall build quality good and the port selection is more than adequate. The screen is good quality and for the price meets my expectations. I upgraded to windows 11 with no issues. The 11370H tiger lake cpu and 16 gb ddr4 lpddr we’re my other requirements for a windows laptop in this price range. The fans will ramp up when doing an update but given the size of the machine, this is expected. Keeping it on ac when doing an update appears to minimize the issue. I am more than satisfied with this machine and highly recommend it as a good budget business ultralight.","Dell Inspiron 13 5310, 13.3 inch QHD (Quad High Definition) Laptop - Thin and Light Intel Core i7-11370H, 16GB DDR4 RAM, 512GB SSD, NVIDIA GeForce MX450, Dell Services - Windows 10 Home",&585

7,Liam Manning,"March 10, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Touchpad is bad, Dell service is worse","The touchpad has been defective from the day I received the laptop, but I generally like it so I contacted Dell customer service for options. They strung me along, offered help and every time it was scheduled, they conveniently had problems that they had to reschedule for. Dell kept closing the service requests and marking them as complete and I kept opening new ones. This happened several times and they deny it until I upload documentation. They strung me along past the Amazon return policy so now I'm stuck. Dell finally agreed to replace it with a new laptop which is a huge inconvenience, but now I just keep getting told to wait (I contact Dell service every day now because they will apparently close the service request if you don't contact them on an unidentified number of days, yet they seem mad that I call in every day as they instructed me to do). Wait. Wait. Two more days. Two more days. Two more days. Wait until they contact you. Just keep waiting. Dell has turned into a garbage company that just wants to throw garbage out and reap the money but never have to talk to customers or take care of their defects. Laptop is okay for now, Dell is terrible and I will never buy a Dell product again.","Dell Inspiron 13 5310, 13.3 inch QHD (Quad High Definition) Laptop - Thin and Light Intel Core i7-11370H, 16GB DDR4 RAM, 512GB SSD, NVIDIA GeForce MX450, Dell Services - Windows 10 Home",&585

10,Disappointed ,"December 11, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Bloated,"This is a really nice laptop, however it came with loads of bloatware. Made it really slow.  Took a while to determine what software I needed to remove in order to preserve the battery life. Only have had it for a few months now, but getting adjusted. Overall it’s  not a bad laptop. Just have to adjust it, and remove the software that you don’t need and purchase a better virus protection program, it comes with a renewable mckafee license. Even though I’ve had it for a few months,  adjustments are never ending,  The tracking, and advertisement  on Google, email and mostly every tab  is insane.

It didn't dawn on me at first to check the temp as I was running this connected to multiple monitors and I didn'tactuallyhave it in my lap. So I ran mem tests, checked event logs etc. Everything came back fine. Fired it up to full functionality and after about 30 mins on just browsing the web, BSOD again. This time checking the laptop it was hot enough that it didn't want to touch it much. So I let it cool and put a laptop cooler under it and it has worked great since. This is a design flaw I believe as to where the vents are located slightly below the inner portion of the hinge from the lid.  The pc itself is great. It's fast, great graphics after I was able to keep it cool to push it and runs many applications at once including teams IDEs, etc. If I had it to do over knowing this I wouldn't buy it again It's a serious design flaw.","Dell Inspiron 13 5310, 13.3 inch QHD (Quad High Definition) Laptop - Thin and Light Intel Core i7-11370H, 16GB DDR4 RAM, 512GB SSD, NVIDIA GeForce MX450, Dell Services - Windows 10 Home",&585

Mi laptop anterior, de otra marca, les puedo decir que no tengo queja alguna, todo funcionaba a la perfección. Ahora adquirí este equipo, nunca había comprado DELL, mas que todo por el precio, ya que tenía la otra marca como primera opción, pero como no bajo de precio, me fui por esta Inspiron 13. Tengo tres problemas con este equipo, uno es el touchpad que no esta funcionando correctamente. Este deja de funcionar por unos segundos y luego vuelve a funcionar. Es bastane estresante cuando estas realizando algo de urgencia y pasa este inconveniente. También he notado que la duración de la batería no es muy buena, la carga se va agotando bastante rápido.
