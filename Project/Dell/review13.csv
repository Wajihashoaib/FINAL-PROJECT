0,Linda,"October 2, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Chose for ports and amount of RAM,"It's been a few months now and, having solved the Insert key issue detailed below and no further problems at all, I am increasing the stars to 5, but I still want to show the bad experience I had with so-called tech support.This has the HDMI and ethernet and USB ports I needed, which were harder to find than I expected. Also the 12GB of RAM beats most of the ones in this price range. Aside from certain keys being in less convenient positions, I have had no complaints until today when I realized the Insert key works in that it presses, but it does not toggle the insert mode. It's always in overwrite mode. This feature is probably so rarely used by most users that they thought nobody would notice. However, it would make what I'm working on much easier. I also must hold Fn key to enable home and end keys to work, which is annoying but at least they work.Calling Dell support had me in tears when ""Puneet"" took remote control of my computer and immediately closed the browser window, despite my shouting to not do so. I had numerous tabs open with important work, and he didn't even ask, then said he made a mistake and meant to minimize it. What an idiot. I was not using Chrome (and was panicking) so I had trouble finding the ""recently closed"" option, which thankfully restored my tabs but what a giant tool.Anyway his test failed, meaning the key is defective, and my only option is to mail in the only computer I have right now and be without it for 2-3 weeks. I am sure there must be an easier fix, like some setting is not set correctly, but they want their sweet warranty bucks and tried selling me the premium plan. When I had a Dell in the past, a tech guy came to my home, so it's pretty galling that I'd have to pay $119 to get a defective computer fixed or be without it for weeks. (I didn't ask but assume I'd have to pay to ship it for service, which won't be cheap either.) And $119 is for a lower 1-year warranty that won't cover physical damage; that would cost $169.BTW calling support went south from the start. A voice comes on and says there are numbers on the underside of your device, so enter it now. It gives you about 2 seconds to turn the computer over and scrutinize the label to find the number among the many others. To top it off, my label was all smudged as if it had been damaged by water but stuck on anyway. I had no idea what I was looking for and the automated voice switched me to Sales, then sales switched me to tech support, and I could have easily found this service tag number by going to the Dell support page, which automatically recognizes your device and displays it. So more unnecessary stress. No wonder Dell is struggling.Add: I learned that the Insert key is not automatically enabled by the apps I was using, which is weird, so it actually worked fine once I found the setting in the individual programs. Still, tech support stunk.","Dell Inspiron 15 3000 FHD 1080p, AMD Ryzen 5, 8GB Memory, 256GB SSD, AMD Radeon Vega 8 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Black",&429
1,Alex,"May 17, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice machine, runs Linux, easy to extend - two or three buts","I bought this machine to run Linux and did not wait long to install the latest Ubuntu 21.04. It works well and so I proceeded to upgrade it to 16GB memory with modules I already had as well as with an extra disk drive in the form of a 2.5 inch SSD to complement the built-in NVMe SSD. After removing the back cover this was easy to do and I am perfectly happy with the result. Couple of warnings, though:* battery life under Linux is poor. I cannot comment on Windows but I get only about 3 hours of usage out of it before I need the charger again. I turned off Bluetooth and activated the 'power saver' setting in Ubuntu. I have not yet played with other power management options in Linux as these tend to be more involved.* Because I need to run virtual machines, I decided to try and upgrade memory to 32GB. Some websites suggest the machine can take this. I was aware of the risk that it would not work and only proceeded because I had another box that I could stick the memory into. Turns out that with 32GB installed the machine would not proceed past the power on self test. It reports memory issues with two orange blinks followed by four white blinks of the power LED. The memory works find in another machine. Btw. Dell documentation states 16GB max and question here on Amazon says it is 8GB per DIMM slot.* I made the mistake of booting into Windows once and connecting to the network. After this I tried to install windows in a VM using the license key from the BIOS (can be extracted under Linux, google it). Microsoft's crazy policies foiled the attempt. If you buy this and intend to run Linux better never boot the pre-installed Windows!Things I like about this laptop:+ matt display, which has a decent 1080p resolution that works great at this size+ extensibility, will add more storage later on once 2TB SSDs are more affordable+ Ethernet port!+ plastic case is actually not as flimsy as some reports made it sound+ pretty good value for moneyThings I don't like:- sound is thin and for video conferencing a headset is needed - business laptop!- USB 2.0 port only on the right-hand side.- can get pretty warm underneath - this is an Intel/AMD box after allHope this helps.","Dell Inspiron 15 3000 FHD 1080p, AMD Ryzen 5, 8GB Memory, 256GB SSD, AMD Radeon Vega 8 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Black",&429
2,Loral,"May 18, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Replaced our old Dell Inspiron,"The laptop my wife used mostly was starting to show its age.  The power cord was looking twisted and like it was going to fail, and came out of the laptop way too easy.Then recently, my wife was getting prompts that CHKDSK was running when she started it, and sometimes ran for about 10 minutes before she could use it.I'm a retired IT guy, so I calculated that with the age of the current laptop, its processor speed, RAM, video etc., that it was time to get a new one.My wife does some web searches, eMail, and plays some card games, so we didn't need a gaming computer.  This one is very affordable, and even folded, it's half as thick as her previous one.With that said, this is far from a business class laptop.  It is worth what you pay for it, but that is not a bad thing.  The processor is good, plenty of RAM for her needs, fingerprint logon (she now loves), and a solid state drive (no moving parts).The monitor is nice and bright and very easy to read, even in our sun room.  Battery life is about 3 hours.Also, understand that there is not a CD/DVD drive in this computer.  If you need to install something, you will have to put it on a thumbdrive from your desktop or other computer.  If you know networking like me, I just shared a drive on my home office PC and connected to it.This comes with Windows 10 Home.  You can go into the System settings and you can do an update to Windows 10 Professional if you need an OS that you can connect to a work network.  Price for that is $99.Everyday since we got it, my wife has thanked me for getting this for her.  That may not seem much to some, but from my wife, that's a homerun!","Dell Inspiron 15 3000 FHD 1080p, AMD Ryzen 5, 8GB Memory, 256GB SSD, AMD Radeon Vega 8 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Black",&429
3,Purdue Pete,"June 22, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Almost perfect,"I've been using this laptop for about a month, and I've only found 3 things that could be improved.1) the keyboard needs backlighting.  I'm often working in low light situations and the lack of backlighting makes typing very difficult.  I've worked around it by tilting the screen down slightly to help illuminate the keyboard.  This is my biggest complaint.2) the SD card should go all the way in when inserted.  Instead it only goes in about 1/2 way.  This prevents you from inserting the card and leaving it there all the time.3) for some reason the F11 an F12 keys don't default to 'home' and 'end'.  You have to use fcn/F11 and fcn/F12 to access those actions.  This is probably a setting in configuration somewhere, but I haven't found it yet.Battery life appears to be outstanding.  The unit is light and very thin.","Dell Inspiron 15 3000 FHD 1080p, AMD Ryzen 5, 8GB Memory, 256GB SSD, AMD Radeon Vega 8 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Black",&429

8,Starlyn,"February 24, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Touchpad is the fatal flaw,"This laptop has a lot going for it - fast processor, generous SSD main storage, lots of RAM memory, FHD screen.  It boots up and shuts down amazingly fast.  The wi-fi and keyboard are adequate.  It would be a great computer, but it has a fatal flaw:  the touchpad.  The touchpad areas for left- and right-click are not easy to use (the sweet spots are in the extreme lower corners) and the cursor-movement portion is so sensitive that when you move it over a portion of the screen that has links, it'll open up everything it passes over.  Plus when you've used it for a while and your finger dries out, the cursor becomes impossible to move at all.  So if this machine had a decent touch pad, or if you can use it with a traditional mouse (which defeats the purpose of a laptop IMO), it would be a value-shopper's dream.  As it stands, it's a nightmare.  I sent mine back.","Dell Inspiron 15 3000 FHD 1080p, AMD Ryzen 5, 8GB Memory, 256GB SSD, AMD Radeon Vega 8 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Black",&429

The Dell Inspiron 15 inch laptop is especially well suited for students who need a simple machine for remote school sessions.SPECS:* 15.6-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) Anti-glare LED Backlight Non-Touch Narrow Border WVA Display* AMD Ryzen 5 3450U Mobile Processor* 12GB 2400MHz DDR4* 512 GB M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD* AMD Radeon Vega 8 Graphics* 802.11ac 1x1 WiFi* Bluetooth 4.1* 720P Webcam with indicator LED when in use.PROS:1.

Slim and sleek modern styling.9. 3 USB ports10. Trackpad with gesture support.11. Speakers offer plenty of volume.12. Webcam is actually pretty good for being only 720p, perfect for online meetings with an indicator LED to let you know when its in use.13. NO BLOATWARE - seriously, none! Except for McAffee, but I was able to easily uninstall it (a first).CONS:1. No USB-C port.2. Battery life could be better.3. Screen brightness is lacking in sunny conditions.4. Fingerprint scanner is fussy.5. No Wi-Fi 6 (outdated)6. Only Bluetooth 4 (outdated)7. Not touchscreen display.8. Keyboard isn't backlit.Listed at around $550, this laptop has a few features I rarely see among laptops - like a comfortable keyboard that includes a dedicated number pad just like a full size keyboard. The keyboard is comfortable, and easy to type on without feeling cramped. The scissor switch keys offer just enough tactile feedback to allow easy touch typing while staying relatively silent. Typing feels crisp and responsive, without the 'mushy' feel you experience when typing on other laptop's keyboards.The smooth, plastic, trackpad, while not nearly as glorious as what you'll find on a MacBook, works well even if it isn't the most responsive. The trackpad supports all the common multi-finger gestures like two finger scrolling, etc. While technically buttonless, the bottom edge of the trackpad has two hidden buttons which serve as the equivalent of a right and left mouse click.Overall laptop build and appearance is very simple and clean, with the entire laptop being made from a single color and texture plastic. It doesn't feel especially high quality, and does sort of feel cheap, but it looks slick with its simple styling and build feels solid and durable for what it is. At this price range, this is all completely in line with what you can expect.The 15inch IPS LED screen is Full HD with a resolution of 1920x1090. At this size the resolution provides a crisp image with no obvious pixilation unless you're right up there with your nose against the screen doing pixel hunting. The color, saturation, and contrast are all pretty average but acceptable for a budget laptop like this. Its worth noting that there is absolutely no backlight bleed along the edges of the screen, nor is there any inconsistencies in the color - screen is highly uniform and consistent which is impressive.Perhaps the one thing that could be better is the range of brightness you have available with the screen. In full daylight, even at full brightness the screen looks pretty dim. For this reason, its probably not best for those who planning on using the laptop while outdoors or something like that.RAM comes stock at 12gb of 2400ghz memory. Plenty of memory for multitasking with tons of web browser tabs open at the same time. AMD Ryzen processor is full capable, although it tends to run hotter than its Intel counterparts, so you'll hear the fan turn on anytime you start doing any changes  to the settings while also doing other things.Battery life is decent, nothing to write home about at 6 hrs on average with moderate usage and less than full screen brightness.Built in ports are great, with one glaring omission - no USB-C port. These days its pretty rare to see a device without one so this ia pretty big bummer. Luckily ports that it does have include two USB-3.0 ports, one USB-2.0, an ethernet port, and an HDMI port.BOTTOM LINE:This is a very competent machine for those looking for a basic computer that offers full desktop functionality at a very affordable price. Overall compact, slim profile that looks as good as it is easy to take with you. Perhaps the best part about it is the keyboard with its 10-key number pad and easy to type on layout.","Dell Inspiron 15 3000 FHD 1080p, AMD Ryzen 5, 8GB Memory, 256GB SSD, AMD Radeon Vega 8 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Black",&429
23,RN,"May 3, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great mid-range for all-purpose use,"My youngest son had been using a 13"" MacBook that was our family spare, but didn't actually have his own computer even though that was essentially his.  He had to use it through most of the school year for distance learning throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and used it for playing games and keeping in tough on-line with his school friends.  During the last few months of school it started to have problems charging so we figured it was time to get him his own and one that would meet his needs better.We needed something that would be able to handle doing frequent zoom meetings, basic word processing,  school work, internet browsing, and yet still be able to handle things he enjoys like gaming with his friends.There's a lot of games he wanted to play but were not compatible with Apple systems so a Windows-based computer was ideal.  I checked out games I know he wanted to play from Steam and looked at their minimum system requirements and this laptop meets the minimum requirements for 100% of the games he owns and about 99% of those he has wishlisted.  He's played a number of games from Steam, GOG, and other places.  He's played games like Terraria, Dragon Ball FighterZ, NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 4, Genshin Impact, and Roblox and all of those have played wonderfully on this system with no problems.For schooling this system handled zoom meetings without issue, worked well Micorsoft Office and Google Classroom/Google Docs.  It handles browsers with many multiple tabs open without issue.  The wifi range is excellent and he can get a signal anywhere in our home (my older son has a gaming computer that a lot more than this and cant get a good signal everywhere like this one).  It has ample storage and decent ram along with a video card that seems to be very capable.He's able to hook up his various peripherals without any issues and so far this laptop seems to be able to do everything he needs and currently wants to do.  Will it run every major AAA game, no, probably not.  Is it VR capable, not even close.  Is it a good general all-purpose computer that's good for school/work and moderate gaming, absolutely!  I think the price is pretty reasonable for the specs and functionality of this laptop.","Dell Inspiron 15 3000 FHD 1080p, AMD Ryzen 5, 8GB Memory, 256GB SSD, AMD Radeon Vega 8 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Black",&429
24,Captain Slow,"July 8, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good general purpose laptop,"I'm not the most technical user. This machine was simple to set up right out of the box. I went from opening the package to using the laptop/on the internet in about fifteen minutes.The best thing about this laptop is the keyboard. It's not cramped and it has a full numeric keypad. As a 15 inch laptop, the machine isn't one of those tiny little mini-laptops where you have to sacrifice on the keyboard, but it's also not one of those 17-inch monsters that's not really very portable. It's a sweet spot.The trackpad is less than stellar. It's not bad, but it feels a little cheap. I guess I've been spoiled by glass trackpads on other machines in the past. The gestures work nicely though, and there's nothing wrong with it. It's basic.The other thing I don't love about this machine is that for some reason they didn't include even a single USB C port. In 2021, that's an odd choice because the writing is on the wall regarding legacy USB-A ports, even if these are 3.1.This isn't a workhorse - I mean it's good. 12 gigs of RAM with this processer is about the bare minimum to have a pleasant experience with Chrome these days, but more RAM would have been appreciated to future-proof it a bit more. It's also not a gaming PC by any stretch, but that's easily forgiven in a laptop.What I've written above doesn't mean that I think this is a bad laptop. It's good. It's not great. It's a middle-of-the-road Windows laptop.

26,Nicholas Calderone,"May 16, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Much nicer than the last Inspiron I had. All in all, a great laptop for students","First off, Amazon's system is suggesting I review the touchscreen. I'm guessing it's because people keep asking about it, this laptop does NOT have a touchscreen.The last time I had an Inspiron laptop was back in college and boy is this different. The plastic has been upgraded from cheap colorful gloss to a nice matte black. The laptop has a much nicer shape than the previous ones (maybe it's just the trend because components are better, but it's still a good reason to upgrade if you're carrying around the clunky old ones).For the price, it's got a great screen (also matte, something touchscreens are never offered with) and 12gb of ram rather than the standard 8 you'll see at the same price. It's quite light for its size thanks to the plastic body and the battery lasts plenty for what I'd do with it (mostly used in a classroom with students). I don't really do battery tests because they vary so much by use.The vega graphics are also plenty for games like valorant and league and the larger display (I'm used to 13"") makes media and games easier to take in.My one and only complaint, and it's one I can't stress enough, is that it uses ONLY a barrel jack for charging. I don't understand why companies don't just standardize with usb c. Everything else I have is, even the emergency light I leave in my car.  Standardized chargers make it so much easier to charge devices when I have multiple different types for students.","Dell Inspiron 15 3000 FHD 1080p, AMD Ryzen 5, 8GB Memory, 256GB SSD, AMD Radeon Vega 8 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Black",&429

It’s a good all-around laptop and it’s very peppy for most tasks. The keyboard is very easy to use since it’s a full-size keyboard with a full numeric keypad. I like that this was able to be included without creating a giant laptop that was too large to be easily portable.Even though the laptop is a good machine there is one big modern option that is missing. There is no USB-C port included and that is a little bit of a bummer for us since we use quite a few other USB-C devices. The display isn’t a touchscreen either, but I can live without that. Some of the other reviews here state that this laptop doesn’t come with WiFi 6 and while again, that would be a nice bonus, it’s not a deal-breaker for me. It does only come with Bluetooth 4, which is pretty outdated. I do also wish the keyboard was backlit. That last thing is more of a creative comfort than anything else, but it would be a great feature to include.Overall, the laptop is a very good machine. It offers a lot of the same power and features as most desktop computers do, but it’s versatile and portable. I think this is a good value for the product.","Dell Inspiron 15 3000 FHD 1080p, AMD Ryzen 5, 8GB Memory, 256GB SSD, AMD Radeon Vega 8 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Black",&429
28,Sean McGill,"May 8, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Not your Grandpa's Dell,"Dell Inspiron 15 3505, 15.6-inch FHD Non-Touch Laptop - AMD Ryzen 5 3450U, 12GB DDR4 RAM, 512GB SSD, AMD Radeon Vega 8 Graphics, Windows 10 Home - Black (Latest Model)The laptop comes packaged well in a plain brown recyclable box, with markings and specifications for the laptop on the outside. Inside the box, the padding for the laptop is molded, recyclable cardboard pieces. I'm pleased to see that they've taken care to make the packaging recyclable. Along with the laptop, is the power supply in two separate bags, and a quick start guide printed on a small fold-out sheet with lots of pictures. There is a QR code on the instruction booklet so you can use your phone to go directly to the support area on the Dell website and download the full manuals I'd expect. The laptop itself additionally comes packed in a plastic bag, probably to protect it from dust and such during shipping. When you open the laptop, there is a thin foam pad on the top protecting the screen from damage during shipping.The first thing I did was to plug it in to charge, to make sure that the charge was full on the battery. Then I'll go to their website using the QR code and take a look at the instructions. Once you find the support page for Inspiron 3505, just go to the documents and choose the one for setup. That'll take you through the setup step by step. Once you press the power button, it starts to finish the windows setup, and that will take you step by step, walking you through setting up your PC for the first time.It's been a while since I've set up a new PC, and it's interesting to note that now Cortana walks you through step by step for the setup. In addition to the older method of typing on the keyboard and clicking for all the responses, Cortana also can now give you a verbal walkthrough, asking you questions about your preferences and making changes based on what you tell it. Word of warning, factory default on the volume seems to be fairly high, so be prepared for the voice to be moderately loud. The setup also includes a subscription to McAfee antivirus. It's not my usual go-to for antivirus, but since it's included, I'll give it a shot. [I found out later that it's only a 30-day free trial, so I'll be taking that out and going back with Windows defender, which is free, and it works great]It appears that part of the setup also includes checking for any updates that have occurred since the computer was manufactured. Once I put in all of my setup info, it went to a black screen with the message let us take care of everything for you.Once the PC finished setting the up process since I provided my Microsoft login information, it logged me directly into my Microsoft account, and since I prefer my devices to sync, my screen was one of my backgrounds. The first thing I did was open the Dell application, which takes you to my Dell and asks you to set up an account. It appears that registering your Dell account also activates your warranty. [A couple of days later, I received an email from Dell support welcoming me to the Dell family and giving links to the most commonly asked questions, as well as explaining warranty options.]During the setup, I started hearing a jet sound, which I presumed was from a web page I was on. Nope. It was the cooling fan motor firing up for the first time. It's not overly loud, but it does have a quite noticeable volume at speed, sounded different from my older laptop and the sound surprised me a little. It's not so much a traditional fan sound, more like a gentle woosh continually running in the background.Checking out things on the new laptop, it seems that not all, or even close to all of the windows updates installed automatically when I first started the laptop. I'm running Windows updates now, there are at least 10 updates for different things that need to run, including a fairly large system update that took a few minutes, requiring several restarts. With any Windows computer, I recommend running Windows update manually at least once a week, as there are often updates that don't push automatically.In setting up my logins to the computer, evidently, this laptop does not support Windows hello face, it comes up with an error message saying, “Couldn't find a camera compatible with Windows hello face "" So, I guess that particular option is out for this laptop.The other biometric login option is a fingerprint scanner, which this laptop is equipped with. I was able to set up my fingerprint for login using windows security, but I have not been able to use that for a login. [Over several days of trying to use my fingerprint to log in, I was able to get it to start functioning. It appears that it's not entirely intuitive as to which part of your finger touches the button, for me, it was a little bit of a learning curve to touch it in just the correct manner.]The laptop also comes with a maintenance program called Dell support assist. it's not automatic, you have to run it manually. the first time I manually ran the support assist program, it found 7 driver updates that Windows update didn't cover.I installed the Netflix app from the Microsoft store because I like to watch a movie on the laptop once in a while, and I have to say playback on this machine is phenomenal! The wide full screen provides an excellent picture, and the speakers give a sound that's better than my TV at home. I don't know where they hid all that sound on this relatively small laptop body, but it's pretty great. The laptop also comes with an onboard program called Dell Cinema Guide, with which you can combine any and all streaming services that you subscribe so that you can watch everything in one spot.In using this laptop for my everyday tasks, I found that typing on the keyboard isn't a hundred percent accurate.  While I'm definitely not the world's best typist, I found that my fingers would slip off the keys and I had more mistypes than normal. Also, I'm not a touch typist and need to look at the keys every once in a while. While these keys indeed are printed clearly and easy to read, I think the keyboard would be better [as in easier to see] if it was backlit.","Dell Inspiron 15 3000 FHD 1080p, AMD Ryzen 5, 8GB Memory, 256GB SSD, AMD Radeon Vega 8 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Black",&429
