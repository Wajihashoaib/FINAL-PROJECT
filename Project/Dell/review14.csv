0,Froggy707,"August 10, 2020",2.0 out of 5 stars,Chromebook Technically Works (That's the best I've got at the moment),"My experience:- Product arrived on time and obviously hand packed...but with very minimal effort to protect the computer during shipment. I received a cardboard (flat rate?) box with the Chromebook wrapped in a single layer of Styrofoam wrapping paper. Charger was in a gallon size zip lock bag. At this point I was expecting the worst, but determined to remain open minded.- Scratches and dings on all exterior surfaces of Chromebook (obviously NOT ""Like New"" condition as advertised). At this point I'm getting frustrated by the clearly misleading description of the product I purchased. But honestly, if the computer works, then do the exterior cosmetics really matter that much?- Opened the Chromebook and the screen is CRACKED. At this point, I'm definitely kicking myself for being a sucker. BUT, the screen cracks are in the black area to the top left of the actually screen viewing area. Maybe a screen protector will hold them in place and this will all just be a funny story one day. All is not lost yet...my optimism knows no bounds...- Plugged up the Chromebook and it took a very long time to load. But it did load! This is a working laptop that my middle-school kiddo can use for remote learning. I'm regaining my composure at this point. Gave the computer to the kiddo and forced myself to concentrate on other things.- That night, kiddo brings me the Chromebook and tells me that the battery isn't working. I ran a battery_test on the Chromebook and no battery was found. Opened up the computer and there is certainly a battery in this thing. No worries, this happens all the time. No telling what life this obviously not ""like new"" battery has had.- Called a local computer store and ordered a brand new battery for $50. Waited 5 days for the store to get my special ordered battery in, but it came as promised and is exactly what I needed. Came home, installed the new battery, and the Chromebook still does not work without a charger plugged in.- Long story short, I bought my kid a very used Chromebook (with a cracked screen) that is incapable of functioning as a laptop because it dies instantly if unplugged.2020 has been one heck of a year. In the grand scheme of things, this buying experience is just not even close to the top of my personal ""unexpected/ridiculous/horrible things that have happened"" list. So, I'm chalking this up to a live and learn experience. My kiddo has a computer that seems to be working at the moment and will do what it needs to for the upcoming remote learning marathon. That said, I've already started socking away what money I can in anticipation of the day that this thing completely craps out. I know, please try to contain your jealousy.I took pictures of the unboxing process and will upload soon...but not right now. Right now this Mama needs a large glass of some nice grape juice.","Dell Chromebook 11 CB1C13 11.6"" Laptop Intel Celeron 2955U 1.40GHz 4GB 16GB SSD",&99
1,Jordan Hatch,"November 27, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Deal and Does the Job!,I purchased this my freshman year in college expecting it to last 6 months at most. It is now the middle of my third year and still running perfectly. At one point I spilled about 8 ounces of water on the keyboard and the trackpad stopped working so I purchased a $5 plug in mouse. That worked for a while and about 5 months later I tried the trackpad again and it was fully functioning. I absolutely loves this laptop and would recommend it if you're on a budget!,"Dell Chromebook 11 CB1C13 11.6"" Laptop Intel Celeron 2955U 1.40GHz 4GB 16GB SSD",&99
2,Cash Burner,"September 26, 2021",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth it.,So I had to buy a new laptop for school and first I made an impulsive decision buying this thinking it was a Windows 10 laptop. I was surprised it was a Chrome book but I was ok with it since the price was fair. The seller who shipped this to me had a previous Google education profile still logged in. I had the courtesy to wipe any previous personal data and start out with a complete fresh new start.. It was ok at first until I started experiencing problems with turning on the laptop. I looked it up and I had a solution that temporarily fixed the issue. I then started having the same problem but all of the solutions I tried just wasn't working. Now it turns on at rare times even if I change the battery. It might just be a hardware problem but I would not recommend this if you absolutely need a laptop for work/school reasons.,"Dell Chromebook 11 CB1C13 11.6"" Laptop Intel Celeron 2955U 1.40GHz 4GB 16GB SSD",&99
