2,"Jeef, the reef","June 25, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for getting some work done.,So the one I got does not have a touch screen so I am not sure why it asked to rate a touch screen. This laptop is great if you want to get get work done and play some minecraft for a little bit. If you open up the back you can add an SSD and if you want you can replace the NVME it comes with for a 2280 nvme. It does also have replaceable memory so if you want to upgrade to dual channel you can. Now if you don't run it at at full brightness and settings you can get a pretty decent battery life out of it. So for average school work and for having work papers this is a great laptop. With the benefit of being able to play some games.,Dell Inspiron 3583 15” Laptop Intel Celeron – 128GB SSD – 4GB DDR4 – 1.6GHz - Intel UHD Graphics 610 - Windows 10 Home - Inspiron 15 3000 Series - New,&279

5,K Alcaraz,"September 11, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,90% PERFECT!!,"I've always LOVED Dell Desktop computers. I've had several throughout many years. But I'd never heard anything about Dell laptops. Knowing that Dell makes the best desktops (in my opinion!), I decided to try the laptop. I couldn't believe how fast I fell in love with this laptop. I've had it for over a month now, using it for several hours each day & I have only found 2 problems with it:The color on the display is dull. Not the correct colors. I mean, I don't know the technical terms for all this, but it seems like the coloring that the display shows, is of low quality. It isn't HDR so it's kind of upsetting. I like to have brilliant color.The 2nd problem is the keyboard. The keys are cramped together so it's hard for me to type because I have big fingers. I usually type 95 wpm but on this keyboard I make so many mistakes that it's like I can't type at all!! I'd like the keys more spread out. All laptops seem to have cramped keys, but this one is worse.But, even with those 2 annoyances, I LOVE THIS DELL LAPTOP!!! The price for it was unbelievable! I'm only going to buy Dell's from now on. The customer service is Old School, which means they care. I will add to this in a couple of months so you can see that I will still love my Dell!!January 22, 2022 - I've had my Dell for almost 5 months now. Like I said, I STILL LOVE MY DELL!! I'm getting used to the keys a little bit but I bought a keyboard & attached it to my laptop & it works great. Like I said in my earlier review, Dell's are the best desktop computers, & now I can honestly say that they make the best laptops too. It's worth it to spend a little more because you'll have your Dell for WAY longer than any other brand.  Soooooo, to sum it all up, I LOVE MY DELL LAPTOP!!!

9,Lauren Nelson,"September 21, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Serviceable Solution,"We were looking to get a second laptop as the pandemic had pushed both my partner and I to be working from home. We weren't looking for anything fancy, but we needed more oomph than a Chromebook. This Dell fit the bill. It's not going to wow you, but it's got enough power to support web browsing, doc and presentation creation, and graphic design programs all at once. It moves along at a nice clip, as well. It's not incredibly heavy, but it's certainly not designed as a ""lightweight"" solution. My one real complaint is that the mouse touchpad is awkwardly positioned and configured, which can slow me down while I'm trying to switch between applications. All in all, I'd recommend it as a basic and affordable option, but don't expect it to turn heads.",Dell Inspiron 3583 15” Laptop Intel Celeron – 128GB SSD – 4GB DDR4 – 1.6GHz - Intel UHD Graphics 610 - Windows 10 Home - Inspiron 15 3000 Series - New,&279

11,melissa,"September 26, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Missing??,I did not realize that there was no CD-ROM drive nor that the keyboard did not light up for easy to see keys.

12,Adrieee,"December 13, 2021",1.0 out of 5 stars,Unbelievably Slow & Not Even The Correct Model,"I ordered this laptop in June for a new job I started. I was to be working hybrid, home on Tues/Thurs and in the Office MWF. My old laptop was a janky Lenovo from college that just needed to go, so I did some digging and found this laptop. The reviews were solid, and the price wasn't steep at all so I went for the purchase.Worst. Mistake. Ever. When I say this laptop is slow, this laptop is SLOW. I've done every update possible, checked for out of date drivers and updated the ones that needed updating. I've installed software for security, and mostly use this laptop for work and my own personal work, so nothing dodgy is ever downloaded onto my laptop.It takes about 5-7 minutes for the initial log-in to load, another 7-10 minutes for the laptop to 'wake up' and what feels like 20 years to load apps, such as Chrome or what have you. Even while typing this review, the lag is just ridiculous. The cursor is currently stuck on the word 'even'........ and it's still stuck there.Just slow slow slow all around since day one of getting this laptop.Now here's the kicker... this week and next I'm working from home again, and I decided to check with Dell's website to see if there are any additional driver updates I can find. Now according to the Amazon listing for this laptop, this is a Dell Inspiron 3583. I went to the Dell support website and did a search for the Inspiron 3583, but the website said that this search didn't yield anything. I went to my Amazon orders to make sure I had the correct model, but again the search didn't bring anything up. SO, I put my laptop onto it's monitor to look at the model number that comes on the laptop.......... the laptop I received is AN INSPIRON 3502!?!? Can you say false advertising?????? I'll definitely be filing a complaint with Amazon.Do yourself a favor, and just skip onto the next laptop if you were considering purchasing this one. I've seen other reviews mentioning just how slow this laptop is, and they are absolutely correct. If you have a 5hr work day, you'll be waiting 7hr just to get this thing slightly up and running. Definitely not a recommended product.",Dell Inspiron 3583 15” Laptop Intel Celeron – 128GB SSD – 4GB DDR4 – 1.6GHz - Intel UHD Graphics 610 - Windows 10 Home - Inspiron 15 3000 Series - New,&279

15,Kelly,"February 15, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,So far So good with this Dell Inspiron,"I use this for personal and business computing at home - currently independent contractor.  Screen size is good - can use stand-alone (when I travel) but add larger screen at home for second screen.  Keyboard is also fine for travel, which again I supplement at home with separate key board.  Could have used more ports but extension ports seem work fine.  I am not a Google fan so the Microsoft suite (Excel, Word, Outlook, etc.) work fine for me - although Edge I am not crazy about.  Google and other aps work fine.I only gave 4 stars as every new computer set up is a pain.

I am 76, my older laptops have 500 GB hard drives so, again it totally on me but I never expected such a wimpy hard drive would even be offered.  I am totally sad.  I have spent a lot of money to get stuff transferred from my old laptop to the new one, not enough hard drive space so all was put on and then taken off.
