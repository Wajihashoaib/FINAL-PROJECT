0,Question&TheAnswer,"March 20, 2012",4.0 out of 5 stars,Refurbished Dell Latitude D620,"I truly give this a 3 1/2 star rating. I'll tell you the Pros and Cons, and what the computer is and isn't made for. I wanted a new Laptop for the online marketing I do since I thought my Toshiba A205 was done for. The shipping from ABCcomputers was fast and everything they said the computer was, was valid information. I was ready to go back to Windows XP OS with the Dell, but decided to install Vista in it instead. The battery and charger worked very well to my surprise lasting well over 2 hours and there were very few cosmetic scratches. Yet the one thing that I cannot get over about the computer was how dim the screen was. I have doubts that all Dell D620 screens come that dark, but it seems as though it's always on a power saving mode for battery life like a typical laptop. It's a slight annoyance, but I believe I can live with it, and I can say this was the greatest of all problems I had with the computer.ABCcomputers described it as a powerful laptop despite it's 1GB RAM memory, 1.65GHz Dou Core Processor and only 80GB HDD memory. To my surprise it was a work horse! Here's the twist, I replaced the 80GB Seagate Hard Drive with an 128GB Solid State Drive in the Dell and could start maybe 10 applications all at the same time including 3 web browsers with practically no application effecting the others performance. Here's another twist; when I found out what was wrong with my Toshiba (a newer computer than the refurbished Dell), I switched the Solid State Drive to the Toshiba that had 2GB RAM, and 1.85 GHz Duo Core Processing. In this experiment, I found the applications sometimes load a few seconds slower than instantly like in the D620. I actually encountered some freezing of applications I had to force close in the Toshiba. This never happened when the SSD was in my Dell D620! I still kept the SSD in the Toshiba because of how bright and wide screened it was over the Dell. Besides, the SSD works good enough in the Toshiba.The computer's processing seems very good with it's original Seagate Harddrive. I really don't know what you can ask for more out of a refub Dell from 2006. This Dell's focus was primarily as a business computer so Word Processing is ideal. I was planning on upgrading the Dell even more by putting in 4 GBs of RAM as it only has 1GB. Before anything my main focus is getting that backlighting brighter as Fn + the UP arrow key does not do the trick. I'm sure that would cost at least over $100, and right now that's too much of an investment out of this secondary computer. At the same time the computer can only use 3.5GB out of the 4GB of RAM because of the BIOS blocking it or 32 bit OS you're using. Either one is the case but I'm not %100 sure. The D620 is not a light computer even though the screen width is just 14 inches wide. They made it pretty sturdy with a Strike Zone feature that probably helps keep your hardware and cpu denying damage.It's not at all a Gaming PC. A video card / whole new motherboard has to be put inside of it just to recognize a newer Microsoft game. So, sorry gaming geeks, you'll have to pay probably another hundred dollars if you wanna play Skyrim and your other favorite games. Gaming wouldn't be exceptional anyway, since the screens brightness isn't top resplendent or enchanting.Concluding my own personal story, I now have a secondary laptop that I'll probably just store files on such as music for I Tunes, and maybe in the future video file, and probably do some web browsing. I think its a good PC, but I would like to know what others feel about their Latitude's backlighting. Comment because I wanna know. It's a decent computer, but I think it would be well worth the $200 if it didn't hurt my eyes to watch lol. Other than that problem I would recommend someone buying this computer and upgrading it as they go making it a super computer like I did.",Dell D620 Laptop Duo Core with Windows XP,&132
1,Beli,"July 28, 2015",4.0 out of 5 stars,Would not recommend,"UPDATE: After updating the drivers and disabling the ""pointing stick,"" my previous issue with the cursor disappeared.It has now been one week since, and the problems have not returned. So seeing that the problem was fixed at no additional cost to me, I'm changing my rating from 1 to 4 stars. I recently discovered that the battery only holds its full charge for approx. 1-3 minutes (depending on brightness and open applications) when i attempted to unplug it and take it to another room. I''m not sure if the battery issue is a new development or not, as I rarely use the device unplugged. If not for the battery problem; I'd have given it 5 stars.Initial Review (July 2015):I purchased this laptop to use I'm my business to run office management software back in February. About 4-5 weeks after starting to use it I noticed that at times the cursor would occasionally jump to the upper right or lower left hand corner of the screen. I was usually able to move it back to where I needed it and I ignored what I considered a minor issues... But as the months have passed, thus problem has become much worse. The cursor now goes to the bottom or top of the screen and slides from left to right. I am powerless to stop it. Using a usb mouse does nothing as the problem seems to be coming from either the touchpad or the ball pointer. I'm at my wits end with this problem. I've just started pulling up my patient files for this afternoon and the touchpad has simply stopped working. The ball pointer will only moved left and right but whatever is ring will pull it back to the right hand corner of the screen. I feel like this was a waste of money and a huge inconvenience as I now have to find a way to transfer my records to another computer and as a less than techno savvy person. Im not sure how to go about doing that without the use of the mouse. I googled this issue today and found out that it is a common problem with this model. So BUYER BEWARE!!! I wish I would have read a review like this one before purchasing this laptop. Ill now have to seek proffessional help with this problem (for the sake of saving important records) which will no doubt cost me more than the laptop itself. I suppose I should have been wary of the price in the first place.",Dell D620 Laptop Duo Core with Windows XP,&132
2,Christopher Nathan,"April 8, 2016",5.0 out of 5 stars,"This process, value and reliability supersedes any Craigslist nightmare hands down!","If you are looking for an awesome reliable laptop when you are traveling, this is the one. Old school laptops cannot be beat by any means, especially a Dell as they hold their value like trucks. Yes, it has XP, but XP is reliable and not a resource hog unlike Windows10. I am moving out of state and need a stable laptop for school. I am also a computer techie and have been around the block millions of times with every computer and operating systems available to the world which is not many at all. I am extremely happy with the service I received and the value of this particular laptop. It is a beast that will not let me down in my needs. Even though, standard delivery is the only option, I needed the laptop before my moving date. I emailed the seller and they responded in a timely manner to confirm shipment. I ordered this on Monday and received it on Thursday midday. It is a very 'clean' laptop. Meaning, the shell is not beat up by any means but gently used. I would not be surprised if parts like the screen and keyboard were replaced because it looks new. The Windows XP OS is a very 'cleaned' up operating system, meaning there is no useless programs and junk. There is a couple extra programs like CCleaner and Malwarebytes that these guys installed which is very useful in case of need because XP is not supported anymore so you will not be able to get updates. Support ended April 2014. You might encounter issues with installing programs that have or will no longer support XP but the initial program will still install and work like Spotify.  It is superfast with great response time on multitasking. Everything is as stated in the sellers description. I run my internet resource off of easytether and support for LGV10 was flawless. An external wireless mouse is an essential with laptops in my opinion. The battery is expected to not completely hold the charge for a great length of time. If you understand that logic, then you understand the purpose. Unplugged is a very short temporary solution. After all, this is an old school laptop.  Keep the ac adapter plugged in when you can and you will be just fine.  If I ever need a laptop again, I will definitely be coming back to this exact spot. This process, value and reliability supersedes any Craigslist nightmare hands down!",Dell D620 Laptop Duo Core with Windows XP,&132
3,Brandon Lee Malcore,"July 17, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,Epic for me anyways.,For budget Gamer I found this laptop to be great for league of legendes. (With upgraded RAM to 4 gigs of ram) being capable to run windows 7 32 bit and 64 bit.Video: The graphics are integrated so its simple. It can run hearthstone and leauge without a problem.Sound: I can't say I like the sound on the device. I use a speaker so its working out for me but without it its hard to a lot to be honest.Speed: like I stated before the 2.0 gigs that it comes with can still do the job for the games I play and the videos I watch whilst using only one of the programs but with the upgrate its fantastic.Battery: Another downside to be hosnet it does heat up quickly and if your a gamer like me you know that if you have it unplugged windows ussaly goes into a power saving mode that slows it down significantly. So giving the battary a break from time to time is ideal.As far as non gaming pursues such as surfing the internet and what not. It runs quite well. But you'll have to upgrade your browser for some sites because windows XP is no longer supported by Microsoft. I use firefox for the best performance.You can of course upgrade to windows 7 32 bit and use windows internet explorer 11 but Windows XP doss not run it.All in all if you know your way around a a personal computer this buy is a steal and a great device if upgraded.I love it already.Oh and john the service Representative was also vary awesome for getting shipped to me faster.Thanks John!,Dell D620 Laptop Duo Core with Windows XP,&132
4,Ngirilover,"November 26, 2012",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great Computer Great Price...Tampa the Best,"I believe that I have now bought 3 or 4 refurbished computers from Tampa Laptops.  They have all been Dell's with Windows XP operating systems.  The people for whom I have bought these computers are educated poor people in sub-Saharan Africa where computer viruses regularly take down laptops.  These computers have held up well.  They are reasonably quick, and with a good virus protector on them and some instruction about scanning and keeping the virus protector up to date, the people for whom I have gotten these computers have been very happy.  One thing that has helped a great deal is the one on one assistance that I have received from Tampa.  I have always reached a human being there when I call to ask a question.  They have replaced batteries for me that were dead, and they have helped me to understand what additions I need on these computers. While the hard drives are not huge, they are fine for starter computers...especially student computers. My understanding is that the XP system still rates as the best for PC's and this is certainly what my African friends have told me.Their prices are very competitive, and again, their service is terrific.  I'm very sorry they are no longer on Amazon Prime, but I will always buy refurbished computers from Tampa. (I am a Mac person myself-so Tampa, start working on them, too!)",Dell D620 Laptop Duo Core with Windows XP,&132
5,Amazon Customer,"August 25, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,A good deal for the price.,"It's  a decent refurbished laptop, there's a loose letter key, and the power cord has some slight separation at the cord/plug joint,  but these are issues I can handle  easily. Overall, I'd say it was a good deal for the price. The  battery that shipped with my order was in good health.",Dell D620 Laptop Duo Core with Windows XP,&132
6,KJ Steve,"June 21, 2013",4.0 out of 5 stars,Clean it up and your good to go.,"Shipping time isnt the best.If you need it now look elsewhere.Computer was well packaged when it did arrive,.It could have used a good cleaning as it had several places where ""stickers""had been removed and not completely cleaned of the glue.Keys as well required cleaning.O.K.,we bought a refurbished unit and we understand that Jeremeys Computers and our standards of a clean refurbished unit do differ.Lets leave the cleaning issue and get to the functionality of the laptop.I removed the laptop from the shipping container and was immediatly able to power up and get online.I checked both the wireless and ethernet .All keys function as they should and all ports appear to work as they should.There are several sellers online and there cost for the same unit is very close.Overall it is a good little laptop.  If you can get by doing a little cleanup on your own in my opinion you are getting a reasonably good working refurbished unit.Maybe when you place your order you can tell them in the comments section you need  a clean working unit.Perhaps one of the other sellers may give you a cleaner unit but I do know that I have a laptop that arrived fully functional.Cosmetics gets a ""D"". Everything else gets  an ""A"".",Dell D620 Laptop Duo Core with Windows XP,&132
7,taylor,"April 26, 2012",4.0 out of 5 stars,Dell laptop,"The pros:  this is a good & clean computer with wifi and the company sent it in a good time frame.  I had just planned to buy a new laptop but an unexpected illness, bad economy, no job, a computer repair that would cost more than buying another computer and living in a rural community all left me in bad shape. I'm glad to have found a good computer under $200.  The cons: a lot of drivers were outdated as well as the windows xp updates (109) and the battery was dead so I had to buy a new one.  My personal problem was I couldn't do any updates so my usb internet modem wouldn't work.  Since I live rural and the closest wifi is 30 miles one way at McDonald's (their wifi is very slow) I couldn't afford to stay very long and it took me a long time to update my system.  I saved up for a mifi hotspot and had to save up for the prepaid card at $40.00 a month.  So that's why it has taken me so long to reply.  As the old saying goes - it is hell to be a poor college student. And no my old community college doesn't have wifi.",Dell D620 Laptop Duo Core with Windows XP,&132
8,"Rebel""K""","March 14, 2013",5.0 out of 5 stars,Don't miss out on a good thing!!,"Being an Mac person since 82, I was kind of leery buying a PC, especially a used one.  After checking out the products on Amazon I settled for the Dell 620 (630) since it had the speed and power I need for my online job.  The computer had a very good price for the performance it offered, and although I did not expect a whole lot in the looks department, I was pleasantly surprised when I unpacked it a couple of days later.  The item looks as if it had never been used and i would challenge anyone to tell it apart from a new one. It ran right out of the box, and I actually like it, even if I still use mainly my Ibook 4G.  After adding my own sofware  which optimizes the whole system it is now perfect. Wify runs at 12mps which is more than enough to download full movies in a matter of minutes.  It also improved my productivity since the work pops up on the screen almost instantly.  All in all I am very pleased with this product, the service I received, and the customer care offered by Tampa Laptops.  I would recommend them to anyone looking for a used laptop at a more than fair price, and a seller that cares about their customers.  I am still an Apple man, but the PC from Tampa Laptop will be by my side, and my new work horse.",Dell D620 Laptop Duo Core with Windows XP,&132
9,Kindle Customer,"October 2, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great model. Keeps in the market after years of Dell not building them.,"Thanks for selling me this laptop. I had another one (same brand and model) but my board died (it was fair after buying it already used and using it hard for a couple of years). So I just used the one I bought here, replaced the hard drive, and it has been working great for about a year.  I upgraded to WINDOWS 10 and it is now working EVEN BETTER!!!!!!I had it updated with all the memory it can get (I think is just 2 GB) and a 1 TB hard drive. But they even sell solid state hard drives for this tough guy. I but a battery replacement every 2 years. It is completely inexpensive. This is a tough, robust, laptop. I am a developer at a major tech company in Seattle, and I use this laptop for my personal self-experimenting. Also I am a Phd student at a top-20 USA university, and this is the computer where I develop, test and show my research to my advisers and colleagues (I do weather computational modeling over non-sql mongo databases) and I run this stuff when riding a bus. So, this laptop IS good.Dell. Please. Make a successor for this model. Current ""successors"" are just big tablets with keyboard. They are social-media computers. Those models suck.",Dell D620 Laptop Duo Core with Windows XP,&132
10,Joel Kitchen,"January 24, 2013",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Machine,"Now, understanding this isn't a I7 machine, it has been great. Everything ran right off and no bloatware to deal with, no wifi problems. The hard drive that I got isn't 80 meg but 150, can't beat that. And I like XP. Sure, it isn't supported anymore, but then I don't do things (like go to places that are notorious for virus like porn sites, or open any extensions) that put me at risk (and just smile when people tell me about their problems with Windows 8). Looking around I note that to upgrade to 4gig is about $60, but at the moment there hasn't been a reason. The seller might do it for you with a call, haven't tried. Been having fun playing the original Mass Effect with no problems, mostly I just run internet, play audio books, and watch movies. Only 2 usb ports, but hey, it's cheap to get usb extensions. I'm really enjoying this machine at this price. I note that a lot of people write about the shipping container. Mine was just a USPS box, but it was well wrapped in bubble wrap, don't think there would have been any problems. I am considering getting another for my goddaughter. Finally, this isn't a problem for me but future buyers should note that there isn't a recovery disk, so if you die, you die. BACK UP :)",Dell D620 Laptop Duo Core with Windows XP,&132
11,kadi Goodlow,"September 30, 2015",4.0 out of 5 stars,I Like it,"Just received laptop and unpackaged....Came with a power cord and I specifically wanted an xp laptop because of old software that won't run on current windows 8. I ran across this baby in the search engine and VOILA! Ok, to start off I have to say I am pleased to say that even though the laptop I received turned on with Windows 7 Professional.... it does have a setting to switch back to XP if need be....However I put in my software that said it was compatible up to windows XP and crossed my fingers....Program downloaded and installed with no problems...Runs fast...WiFi capability and also mine has four USB ports...Happy Camper for $45...I would suspect that it s great for personal needs that don't dwell on high graphics, but for the price great for college students and teem papers and simple gamers....Hope my review helped.",Dell D620 Laptop Duo Core with Windows XP,&132
12,Joe S,"December 2, 2016",5.0 out of 5 stars,The laptop was in very nice condition but it all started with a major hiccup,The laptop was in very nice condition but it all started with a major hiccup.  The AVG anti virus came up almost immediately after I got thing somewhat configured.  It told me there was a virus on the computer.  It asked if I wanted AVG to remove the virus and I chose this option.  I got on the internet and the AVG anti virus warned me that the same virus was detected again.  I chose to have it removed.  Almost immediately I got a voice message/warning that my files had been encrypted and links were provided to get me where I should go to pay ransom for my files.  Since I had nothing at all on the computer at this point I chuckled to myself about their timing.  I immediately contacted the seller about this issue and told them this was not acceptable.  They promptly sent me another hard drive all loaded with Windows XP(what I had wanted when I bought the laptop) and ready to go.  The whole transaction started on rocky footing but the seller quickly resolved the problem and I am a very happy camper.,Dell D620 Laptop Duo Core with Windows XP,&132

This computer came right up in XP and several of my programs were working in half an hour.  I use XNView for graphics and Quickedit for text files, they were working and finding my files in no time.  I even tried the Open Office set up and got it to recognize Word and Excel with no trouble, it also called in some files from Office 2003 that I have had for over a decade.

I did not want to spend a lot of $$ for her first computer so I gave this refurbished one a shot.  It was delivered within a week of ordering it.  It is a refurbished Dell D620.  80 GB HDD is sufficient for basic software but not really for gaming.  It has 4 USB ports but one of them was damaged so I only have 3 working USB ports which is sufficient for my kid's needs.  She watches a lot of online rerun TV programs.  For $175 it was not worth sending back.  Battery life good.  Slight scratches on the cover but is expected for a used laptop.  It was WiFi ready and it was easy to set up to our home wireless.

After verifying that the D620 worked properly by connecting to the internet and installing XP SP 3, I moved over one of the RAM chips (for a total of 1.5 GB) and the harddrive from the HP.  I then installed Windows 7 and recovered her data files (I didn't really expect a college student to use the flash drives that I gave her for backups). Finally, I installed software including Office 7.  Throughout the process the D620 performed flawlessly.  I tested it by running DVDs, Office apps and videos over the internet (after I set up a wireless connection).  This is one fine notebook, very fast and with a good display.  Its only ""short comings"" are obvious from the specs, i.e., no web cam, no media slots and no DVD burner.

My only problem with this laptop is that it is running Windows XP which Microsoft has stopped supporting and many websites will not let you in because this os is outdated. That being said this laptop is compatible with Windows 7 and maybe even Windows 8 you just have to do an upgrade. The upgrade can be tricky and is costly but worth it if you use the internet a lot.

I bought it refurbished two years ago, and the only problem was that the battery doesn't hold a charge.However! Now that Microsoft discontinued support for XP, it leaves me in a quandary. You leave yourself open to malware and viruses by keeping XP on there. This machine CAN be upgraded to Windows 7, 8, or 8.1. The specs are good enough. But it is an older machine, leaving me wondering whether it's worth it to buy the new OS or just invest in a newer laptop.

You know how some laptop keys are kind of stiff and you can't type as fast or smooth as you like, well this one is superb.  I loved it so much that I went crazy a few weeks ago when my laptop crashed probably from a virus.  I emailed for assistance from the seller via Amazon and received a quick response.  The bottom line is I purchased a Dell Restore disk from the seller and I received the very best Technical Support I could have asked for.  James in their Technical Support Team, was patient, thorough, had a great speaking voice and he didn't quit until I got my laptop working again.  That's incredible support, the PC is amazing again, and I would 100% recommend this product to anyone who wants to buy a laptop and I would 100% recommend the seller.

22,L. Sparkles,"August 3, 2014",1.0 out of 5 stars,Treat others the way you would like to be treated,"This company enclosed a letter with this laptop asking for a 5 star rating stating there customers were important to them and asked to contact them first with an issue. Alas I cannot comply. I have not contacted them as I don't see a reasonable resolution to my issue. This laptop is virtually worthless to me as when I received it in July, I instantly received a prompt when turning it on. It said that windows XP will no longer be supported after that very month, July of 2014. I would have to upgrade to windows 8.1 or expect to be targeted by a virus. I subsequently found out it would cost me around $230.00 to buy the upgraded software and have it installed. So this deal was no deal at all. If this company had been forth coming about this issue in the write up I certainly would not have purchased it. I'm normally a Mac girl and this windows issue was unknown to me. So there ya go... Stuck with a worthless laptop unless I want to go through the ordeal of trying to return it, at my cost, PLUS that ridiculous made up meant to take more of your money 'restocking fee'. In my opinion this company is not above board. Anyone can give lip service in a letter, but we know ye by your actions. Or in my case lack there of.

26,Angie,"June 30, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,The best investment I have made in yr's.,"I ordered this computer on Thursday and the very next Monday I received my computer. I am very happy with what I received. I was not expecting it until the following week. I thought it was coming UPS however it came reg. mail carrier. I was happy with that because of the fact I did have to sign for it. I am an avid face book gamer and from what I see so far I will have no problem's with it. I would recommend it very much. I do however have to get anti virus for the computer but then again I planed on that anyway. My husband is a computer guy and he has looked it over and said "" Honey you did very good with this computer"" Now I am ordering him a computer next month when I have another $125.00 As far as any other games I am not sure of yet but I am sure will have no issues there either.",Dell D620 Laptop Duo Core with Windows XP,&132
27,Ray Ray,"December 30, 2011",5.0 out of 5 stars,personal experience wasnt the best even after reading previous reviews,Everything was fine with the computer- you can defiantly tell its used with minor scratches(I expected that b/c its a refurb). The main thing that upset me was that the battery did not hold a charge at all. The computer would die as soon as I unplugged it. The reason why I didn't send it back is because it stated returns are at the buyers expense if anything was faulty. So it is cheaper to buy an new battery for it and charger cause that was faulty as well. Sooo i guess that's the thing with buying electronics online you never really know what your going to get- didn't help this was my first time. but other than those two main things its working fine so far.and an update- I reached out the the sender and they are sending me a battery. They were very prompt with replying and offered to take care of it. So I was very happy that they were very nice and willing to help me by sending me a new battery. Very happy!,Dell D620 Laptop Duo Core with Windows XP,&132
28,HARRY HANSON,"December 31, 2011",4.0 out of 5 stars,Why Buy New????,"I have to say I am very pleased with my purchase of this refurbished Dell D620. It was shipped free and arrived in great condition. The Latitude is great not having all the blotware that the Insprion retail units come with. If you are like me and concerned about buying a refurbished laptop, I am here to tell you this was my first and will not be my last. It is a great way to save 60%+ over buying new. The only negative I can come up with is that the battery doesn't hold much of a charge lasting only about an hour. I highly recommend buying from Tampa-Laptops. They were very helpful with a few questions I had after the unit was delivered.",Dell D620 Laptop Duo Core with Windows XP,&132
29,ROFLCOPTER,"August 31, 2012",5.0 out of 5 stars,Extremely Pleased!,"First of all, if they happen to read this, thanks to the  Tampa-Laptops.  I was looking for an inexpensive laptop for my personal use and these guys came through.  I've had this computer for 4 months and still running smoothly.  The only flaw in this computer it gets very hot and once it does it goes off.  The high point when it does shutdown and wait few moments after rebooting (always press the F1 key)--everything is saved -- thankfully!  My computer is running on a Windows 7 and glad for it.  My desktop is Windows Vista and like most who share my opinion it's terrible.  My memory is also running 2.00GB; Hard drive is 93.0GB (w/estimate of 120GB drive inside), if you want to upgrade some of these features you can definitely do themselves or get someone else to do them for you -- just becareful.  Overall very pleased with my purchase for an $183 bucks it was well spent!",Dell D620 Laptop Duo Core with Windows XP,&132
30,BAM,"June 20, 2016",3.0 out of 5 stars,Dell D620 Laptop Duo Core with Windows XP is not longer supported...,"Purchased refurbished units for my two grand kids to use in school and at BAMikler Summer Camp.  They are great!  Just that no support available for Windows XP now! The only issues I have had was with the battery not holding a charge and the short life span of the AC adapter charger.  The computer only is good for an hour and you have to plug in the charger.  It has worked well for the grand kids for a year now with no other issues.  Looking to soon upgrade, preferably to new ones!",Dell D620 Laptop Duo Core with Windows XP,&132
31,Christina Hodge Parks,"March 5, 2019",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great labtop for a kid/toddler,"My daughter uses this to surf You-Tube.

32,jesswhite22,"January 27, 2013",4.0 out of 5 stars,Everything is.great so far!,I received my lap top in less than 2.weeksnand it is in great condition with the exception of a few tiny scratches on the cover. Wifi has connectednwithout a problem. If you plan on using it battery only sometimes I recommend ordereing a new one when u purchase this laptop. Mme would not turn on unless it was plugged in no matter how long I charged it so save some money on extra shipping and buy the battery at the same time.  It is very lightweight also. Ive had it for a month so I hope t continues to be a great find as it was a great deal.,Dell D620 Laptop Duo Core with Windows XP,&132
33,Stephanie,"August 22, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Quality,This is a great laptop.

Irvine,"February 11, 2013",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not quite what I was looking for,"I received this in a timely manner, but the back light in the monitor was out when I turned it on for the first time.  When I called to let them know they told me I had to send to get it fixed and I had to pay to send. I decided at that time just to return because I'm not quite sure if I was going to keep it. So I just returned it, which I had to pay for. Just because they didn't provide a return label and I had to pay for it I would not order from them again. However they were very courteous when contacted and gave me no problem to return.",Dell D620 Laptop Duo Core with Windows XP,&132
36,Renetta McClee,"February 17, 2013",2.0 out of 5 stars,Big disaster,"I just received this item, yesterday, and after anxiously awaiting its arrival...I wish I had saved my money and put it on a better laptop. I know you get what you pay for but I would've tolerated almost any other minor problem but the screen being messed up. From the time I took it out of the box to just now, the screen would show all these lines up and down it unless you pressed down on it with your thumb. As soon as you removed your thumb, it would do the same thing, making it impossible for you to type or move the cursor. The only time I could type is when I held the corner of the screen with my thumb, which is ridiculous! I am planning to contact the seller on Monday and see if I can arrange to ship this ""thing""back to them and get a refund. I would accept a laptop in much better shape in exchange for this one but I don't trust that they will send one any better.",Dell D620 Laptop Duo Core with Windows XP,&132
37,WI,"December 8, 2013",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great buy!,"The computer arrived in a timely fashion, ordered from Tampa-Laptops.  However, the hard drive was failing and the battery was dead.  I called the shipper and received credit for a new battery (which I ordered and works well) and the hard drive was replaced with one of better quality.  I also requested no OS which was honored.  The guy at Tampa-Laptops was friendly and helpful. I now use this computer on a daily basis.  It stays cool under extended use and meets my needs.  A great buy for those on a budget!",Dell D620 Laptop Duo Core with Windows XP,&132

The only issue I have is the seller(Open Electronics) specifically, in all capital letters, said the screen had no dead pixels but it has several. They also said , in all capital letters that there are no bad sectors. Since the screen has dead pixels I am skeptical about the lack of bad sectors.Over all I am mostly satisfied with the purchase. The dead pixils are scattered and barely effect the image. The response time is fast also. The CD and DVD player functions work well.",Dell D620 Laptop Duo Core with Windows XP,&132
41,D. Caine,"January 18, 2013",5.0 out of 5 stars,Customer Service earned these stars!,"We bought this laptop reconditioned from Jeremy's Laptops here on Amazon.  The laptop is just fine and serves its purpose -- it was a Christmas gift to our teenage daughter who is aspiring to be a writer.  What impressed me here was the customer service we received.  After receiving the laptop, we had a little problem with it, so I posted a question to the seller through the Amazon site and received, not only a response, but a personal phone call from Jeremy --- on the same day that I posted the question!  Jeremy was very easy to work with and clearly puts customer service at the top of his list :)  Did I mention that phone call he made to us was while he was on vacation during Christmas?  I would most definitely purchase from this seller again.",Dell D620 Laptop Duo Core with Windows XP,&132

I have not been able to get it to do anything since.  I am not sure how it works.  When I get it fixed and a virus protection product installed I will try the computer again. Until then I can't even use it!!

The first one I received was defective but upon calling and speaking personally to Paul G.(PG Computers), he offered me an upgrade of more RAM or Win7. After I returned the bad unit, (yes I had to pay the postage), he sent me a new one with the upgrade.He even e-mailed me the tracking no.#.  It came quick (3 days).  As to the laptop, it's a sweet machine. WIFI, Buetooth, plenty o' 15"" screen, USB ports,DVD RW!  OK, it's an off lease refurb, and it's probably about 6-7 years old, but it's still fast, runs good, looks new, and best of all, it was under $150.

Didn't want to learn new O/S, etc., and this one came with 7 / XP.  Looks like new.  Runs quieter than my old ones.  Great price.  Not sure I will ever buy new again, when refurbished is so good and so inexpensive.  P.S.  My apologies to the potential buyer who questioned me as to how many USB ports this has.

46,Alex Humble,"September 28, 2012",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good affordable laptop,"It is a very good product. I bought it because I needed serial port, which is very rare in modern laptops. There are lots of USB to serial adaptors on sale, but they mostly incompatible. I created DOS partition on harddrive because my obsolete program was DOS based, but then I discovered that the program worked very well from Windows XP also. I had very bad experience before running my obsolete program on laptops so I simply did not expect such great compatibility! Besides this I use the laptop for my high definition video, which requires a powerful computer. The video runs very smoothly with really high quality. The battery also is very good. It lasts almost forever. The option of additional battery instead of CD/DVD drive is also a very good feature. Indeed it is a great computer and the price is also great!",Dell D620 Laptop Duo Core with Windows XP,&132
