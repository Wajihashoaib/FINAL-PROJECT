1,K. Jones,"February 11, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,A Quality Product,"I'm happy with my new laptop.  Dells to me are the best as far a PCs go.  One thing I didn't expect was how heavy it was. It's still very heavy in the order of old school laptops.  However, it's processes fast.  Mine is not a touch screen laptop.  Another thing that I wanted to know but the seller didn't list in the ad is MS Office installed.  Yes, but I've read reviews that it's a trial. I've not received a notice yet that it's a trial version. Also, it has McAfee protection. I'm not sure if that is a trial version or not.  Seller, these are the two things I'd suggest you ad to the ad so that potential buyers know this upfront and are not having to guess.Other than, the order arrived on time as promised. I recommend this seller but do hope they put more relevant information in the ad about the software installed.  This would be helpful to the average purchaser who are not tech nerds. We'd like to know what's installed, if it's a trial version or not, etc.  If the ad had this information and I missed it, I apologize.  Maybe it should be featured more prominently because I searched and searched, prior to making this purchase, and didn't see the information upfront. I didn't have the time to postpone making a purchase until I posted a question and then wait around until someone decides to answer. Thanks in advance for your attention to this matter.","2021 Newest Dell Inspiron 15 3000 Series 3501 Laptop, 15.6"" FHD Non-touch, 11th Gen Intel Core i3-1115G4 Processor, 8GB RAM, 1TB Hard Disk Drive, Webcam, HDMI, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Windows 10 Home, Black",&479
2,J Peter,"January 18, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Basic PC w/Windows 10 Home (not S) at a Reasonable Price,"This Dell is our financial PC for taxes, finances, etc. not for general web surfing or gaming.  Nothing fancy which meets the needs.  Not an SSD as I opted for more storage at the lower price point.  No DVD but an inexpensive external one does the job on the rare need.  No touch screen but that 'feature' is really pointless on this class of PC.  Just a decent & reliable workhorse that Dell sells.  I definitely would NOT recommend any locked down Windows S package.  The included & eventual upgrade to Windows 11 will be pursued at some point.  I can recommend this PC at the lower end price, disk space, processor, memory, o/s plus previous good experiences with Dell systems over many years in business use and now in good ole retirement.","2021 Newest Dell Inspiron 15 3000 Series 3501 Laptop, 15.6"" FHD Non-touch, 11th Gen Intel Core i3-1115G4 Processor, 8GB RAM, 1TB Hard Disk Drive, Webcam, HDMI, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Windows 10 Home, Black",&479

In fact, it was slower than my work PC (which is at least 8 years old). The specs are outdated for being released in 2021. Battery life is almost non-existent. I would not recommend this product because there are so many laptops in this price range that are a lot more efficient.","2021 Newest Dell Inspiron 15 3000 Series 3501 Laptop, 15.6"" FHD Non-touch, 11th Gen Intel Core i3-1115G4 Processor, 8GB RAM, 1TB Hard Disk Drive, Webcam, HDMI, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Windows 10 Home, Black",&479
4,Amazon Customer,"February 9, 2022",2.0 out of 5 stars,Slow since the day we purchased it,"Was excited that I bought a computer for my daughter, but found out weeks later that she wasn't using it because since the day she purchased it, it runs slow such as when she loads websites. Thinking perhaps she needed help, I tried to use it as well, but it is extremely slow to use websites that I use daily such as MS365 and browsing new websites.I asked my son who is a programmer and he said that one of the base capabilities - maybe it is the RAM - is already at capacity to run the native programs of the computer, so when we tax it with a new website, it slows down.Looked into purchasing a solution for this computer, but when he priced it out, it seems that we might as well purchase a new computer. Am frustrated because it seems we flushed $500+ down the toilet.The large screen is a plus though...Would really appreciate if the company would swap this one out.","2021 Newest Dell Inspiron 15 3000 Series 3501 Laptop, 15.6"" FHD Non-touch, 11th Gen Intel Core i3-1115G4 Processor, 8GB RAM, 1TB Hard Disk Drive, Webcam, HDMI, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Windows 10 Home, Black",&479
5,Barbara T.,"January 9, 2022",2.0 out of 5 stars,I really wanted to like it,"I did like that it was light but within the first few days started having problems with the keyboard and certain keys stopped working. I called the repair center and within about two weeks, a repair man came to the house after ordering the replacement keyboard and had it fixed  within a couple of hours. It worked ok for several weeks and then I went to shut it down and restart it and it would never turn on again. I looked up , on my old computer several possible issues and things to try but sadly nothing offered a solution . I wound up having to sent it back for a refund that had almost a 100 dollar 'restocking ' fee attached to it. I have used Dells in the past for my job but this issue  has changed my mind about their laptops . It is sad enough that laptop prices have soared in the past few years but after this issue I will think long and hard before trying another Dell product.","2021 Newest Dell Inspiron 15 3000 Series 3501 Laptop, 15.6"" FHD Non-touch, 11th Gen Intel Core i3-1115G4 Processor, 8GB RAM, 1TB Hard Disk Drive, Webcam, HDMI, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Windows 10 Home, Black",&479
6,Jesse Adams,"June 7, 2020",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent,"This laptop is perfect for my work. I needed a laptop with a finish that could take a bit of abuse and won't show off scratches and prints prominently. The matte black, textured finish does exactly that.The touchscreen is a wonderful feature because I'm not completely adept with the touch pad. It makes it easier to navigate hard to get to forms and links. Unfortunately, the screen is a high gloss which will show off every print, scratch and abrasion it may suffer from. It seems counter intuitive for a touchscreen monitor though it's easily solved by placing a matte screen protector on it which everyone will end up doing anyhow.It's very slim, light weight and I like that very much. The 15.6"" screen is a dream! It definitely gives you the impression that the laptop is high quality and let's you enjoy watching videos and movies with confidence. I'm quite impressed by this laptop.If you're looking for a basic laptop to run spreadsheets and simple apps this is the perfect laptop for that.","2021 Newest Dell Inspiron 15 3000 Series 3501 Laptop, 15.6"" FHD Non-touch, 11th Gen Intel Core i3-1115G4 Processor, 8GB RAM, 1TB Hard Disk Drive, Webcam, HDMI, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Windows 10 Home, Black",&479

8,Doc Smith,"April 5, 2021",1.0 out of 5 stars,Big Disappointment and Failure,"I bought this laptop for one reason....so my isolated 87 year old mother could have contact with her children during COVID. I spent much time researching what computer would be the best for video conferencing--specifically on Zoom. So two of the most important things required on this laptop were quality built-in mic and webcam. It also needed to be reliable and easy to use. I could not be there in person to handle any tech issues for my mother so I needed to have confidence everything would work. The very first time she connected on Zoom, we realized the built in mic was crap. We could barely her voice when she would start talking, then it would get louder, then faded in and out. (I learned after additional research many others have had this some issue) She had an external mic, so she plugged that in and it worked, so I let that issue go. Everything was fine until today, Easter Sunday. I was looking forward to a Zoom meeting with my son and mother, but learned my mother's Dell was slow as molasses and after an update, her built in webcam no longer worked on Zoom. After an hour of trying to trouble shoot with her and even having my son who is an IT professional living outside the country work with her, determined there is something seriously wrong with the laptop. My mother lives 360 miles away from me and I'm not sure what I can do to help her at this point. This was supposed to be a reliable computer excellent for video conferencing with awesome mic and webcam. So instead of Easter Sunday ending with an awesome virtual get-together with my loved ones, I am now stressed, in tears, and angry.

11,laurie b,"September 25, 2021",1.0 out of 5 stars,Screen Defective & Blue Screen,"This is my 2nd purchase of this model. The first laptop was great, but this one blue screened twice within the month I’ve owned it.  The computer repaired itself both times, but a day or 2 after the 2nd blue screen the monitor stopped working correctly. There were vertical and horizontal lines and crooked ones too. It looks like there is liquid behind the screen when I powered it down.Customer service online chat and to the call center said I dropped the screen and it was obviously cracked from the pic I uploaded. After trying to explain numerous times that it only looks cracked when the monitor is on. When turned off there are no cracks, but both reps refused to deal with me and didn’t want to see another pic. Finally I asked for a manager explaining the screen problem and he sent a prepaid box to ship it to their repair center. He did state that if I cracked or dropped the unit  then they will not fix it, but if they find it is a hardware problem they will repair it for free under their warranty. I also explained that I purchased accident insurance when I purchased the laptop, but I’m not claiming it as an accident, because it was just sitting in my bed when the screen went wonky. Now the screen won’t turn on at all. I will update and give more stars if Dell honors their hardware warranty.","2021 Newest Dell Inspiron 15 3000 Series 3501 Laptop, 15.6"" FHD Non-touch, 11th Gen Intel Core i3-1115G4 Processor, 8GB RAM, 1TB Hard Disk Drive, Webcam, HDMI, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Windows 10 Home, Black",&479

Apparently this is a known dell issue from way back, but none of the hacks work, so I'm looking at a repair shop ($$$).Since the battery won't charge, the bios can't update. In addition to being very slow, it won't allow files transfers anymore either. So it's basically a very expensive paperweight. Buy a Mac and save yourself the aggravation.
