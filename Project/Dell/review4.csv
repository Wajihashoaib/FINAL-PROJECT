0,ManofSteelo,"February 28, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,"So Far, So Great","Have had this about six weeks now, and couldn't be more pleased, overall. Familiar with Dell laptops because of my work computer (5500), and so when I needed a new home laptop, going Dell was a no-brainer.Overall, this device is fantastic, and certainly offers a great alternative to using my Android smartphone for emails and internet browsing; handles Microsoft Office and Adobe products with ease and aplomb also. Windows 11 upgrade arrived about 2 weeks after I set the computer up -- have not had any problems using that OS since installing it then.By no means am I a hardcore user, but it's nice to know that I have the gigs and the vid quality in the chamber, so to speak, if and when needed. Price keeps fluctuating here, so that might be a minor deterrent along with the relatively poor lighting on the screen (my 5500 is much brighter, and it's a 2019). But en toto, this is a can't-miss purchase for those folks who can keep their personal computing lives separate from their work ones. Highly Recommended!!FiveStars.","Dell Inspiron 15 3501 15.6 inch FHD i7 Laptop - Intel Core i7-1165G7, 16GB DDR4 RAM, 512GB SSD, Intel Iris Xe Graphics, Bluetooth 5.0, WiFi, HDMI, Windows 10 Home - Black",&813
1,B. Jones,"June 4, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Not built for sound.,So far this laptop has been amazing.  But the speakers are awful.  It needs to be turned way up to hear it.  I've watched some YouTube videos on it & can't hear them unless it's up to at least 65%.  Maybe headphones would work better?,"Dell Inspiron 15 3501 15.6 inch FHD i7 Laptop - Intel Core i7-1165G7, 16GB DDR4 RAM, 512GB SSD, Intel Iris Xe Graphics, Bluetooth 5.0, WiFi, HDMI, Windows 10 Home - Black",&813

4,Kyle,"April 21, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,2 Major Drawbacks....,"Overall a great, powerful computer...2 issues are the charging cable is on the left side, and the speakers are under the front of the computer so if you use it sitting in your lap the sound is muffled.","Dell Inspiron 15 3501 15.6 inch FHD i7 Laptop - Intel Core i7-1165G7, 16GB DDR4 RAM, 512GB SSD, Intel Iris Xe Graphics, Bluetooth 5.0, WiFi, HDMI, Windows 10 Home - Black",&813
5,Robert J McCracken,"December 25, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,No complaints,"No dislikes, just normal home use. YouTube, Facebook and etc. Keep in mind this is a laptop, so everything is micro. You will probably want to have an external camera and a descent headset. It does come with Windows 10 and you can upgrade to Windows 11. You have that choice on initial setup. If you don't like 11, you can restore 10. Also, it seems these days, most of our electronics are made in China. At least Dell products are. Overall, I'm happy.","Dell Inspiron 15 3501 15.6 inch FHD i7 Laptop - Intel Core i7-1165G7, 16GB DDR4 RAM, 512GB SSD, Intel Iris Xe Graphics, Bluetooth 5.0, WiFi, HDMI, Windows 10 Home - Black",&813

12,James,"March 19, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,The hinges connecting the keyboard/mainframe to the screen can be damaged,"The lapto itself is okay, it's fast and it performs well. However, it had 2 issues. One is that it tended to overheat and, while it didn't seem to affect performance, it did make me wonder the life of the laptop under such conditions of heating itself so much. The second, and most important issue, is that the right hinge that connects the keyboard/mainframe to the screen began to pull the hardware connected to the screen everytime a closed and open the laptop. Unfortunately this started happening on day 34, 4 days after returns are no longer possible via amazon. I do apparently have a warranty with Dell and I'm seeing my options, but don't really have my hopes up.","Dell Inspiron 15 3501 15.6 inch FHD i7 Laptop - Intel Core i7-1165G7, 16GB DDR4 RAM, 512GB SSD, Intel Iris Xe Graphics, Bluetooth 5.0, WiFi, HDMI, Windows 10 Home - Black",&813
