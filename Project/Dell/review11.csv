0,1eyejacks,"August 22, 2013",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good Laptop,"The Dell D630's were made in 2007 and 2008 and are a nice sturdy and rugged laptop--not like some of the all plastic ones. So it weights a bit more and the technology is 5-6 years old. It's also had 5-6 years of prior use. I need a sturdy laptop for some stuff I do so I gave this a shot. I also needed it right away. I bought this from Red Tag on Amazon and he sent me a good laptop and I've had only a couple small problems. Like the Windows Office included was only a Trial version--not what I wanted. I paid extra for that a 2 extra MB of RAM--the RAM is fine. I left 5 stars because it's a nice clean unit and works well. Pre-sale communication was good, but post sale was erratic. Red Tag has 100% positive feedback.The big thing you have to consider when buying a refurb is price vs value to you. Sure the refurbs are cheaper, but not that much cheaper when you consider that for an extra hundred +/- you can get a brand new laptop, never before used with a 1 year warranty. After looking I see many of the refurbs are way overpriced and I should have bought a new one with new technology.That hundred bucks I may have saved may come back to bite me. Any problems and one little repair will be over $100 so you may want to shop around before you buy a refurb. There are better refurb prices too out there--I discovered later. Next time I'll buy a new laptop, just for the newer technology, warranty, and no prior use. Some of these refurbs and used are way too expensive. Look around the internet first. Prices have really dropped on new laptops too and these refurbs should drop too.I've used mine everyday for nearly 3 months and so far it's fine. For now.",Dell Latitude D630 14.1-Inch Notebook PC (OS may vary) - Silver,&258
1,Vanessa,"December 1, 2011",5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic Little Computer!,"I purchased one of these laptops from Link-Tronics Memory through Amazon, to replace a laptop my grandmother had that she lost in a wildfire in Texas.  She loved it! But more importantly, she took it to her computer guy and he said it was an excellent computer - better than any refurbished computer he sold.Then I purchased one for my sister who has wanted a laptop for a while.Finally I purchased one for my teenage son for Christmas.What I was thrilled about these little laptops is that they came loaded and tweaked almost exactly how I would done. In all honesty, I was prepared with my OS disc and drivers and programs to reformat, but there was no need to do so.The performance of these laptops has far superseded an XPS gaming laptop that was given to me a couple years ago. It's an old model, but that should still say something about the Dell Latitude D630.It's slim and has a nice profile to it, easy to carry with you if you don't have a case.I have refurbished several of our old computers over the years so my advice to those that have had a bad experience with this laptop is that they *are* refurbished. When companies refurbish a computer, they go through and test to see what needs replaced and they replace it or fix it, wipe the drive (or stick a new one in), maybe clean it up a bit, and you have a refurbished computer. Considering the age of the model, there are surely things that will wear out or break much sooner than you would expect from a brand new computer. The lids, keyboards, mouse buttons, and whatnot are guaranteed to have some wear and scratches, it may or may not arrive looking sparkly and new.  Buying refurbished most likely means that calling the manufacturer will do no good for support, as it is no longer under their warranty. Purchasing a refurbished, one should expect these things and set their expectations accordingly. It is not a brand new computer.All in all, the Dell Latitude D630 is a nice little working computer. It makes a perfect gift for kids, or anyone that just wants a decent laptop, but not want to spend a fortune.  The price is good too - I've looked for months for something and found this to be the best bargain.I would definitely recommend this laptop!",Dell Latitude D630 14.1-Inch Notebook PC (OS may vary) - Silver,&258
2,JFF,"December 24, 2013",5.0 out of 5 stars,Just a fantastic piece of equipment.,"The headlines pretty much said how I felt about it. You know that you have something which you value when you are thinking about getting a similar one as a spare-not because you feel the one in your hands it unreliable-because you know that accidents do happen, and you would hate to be without something this efficient for an extended period of time. I purchased one two years ago at what I considered to be a good price, and I just got another one because to me the price was sooo right. They are both performing superbly.One word of caution though: In buying computers-new or old, but especially old, yopu want to try and make sure that you know exactly what you are getting for your money. I wish that amazon would require of their vendors that they post more complete descriptions when it comes to something like a computer, which carries a big price tag and does include many details and components/parts. However, since they don't, make it a point to contact the potential vendor by email with some direct questions before making a purchase. Just because the general product description says one thing does not guarantee that it applies to the one you are buying. Case in point: my second laptop came with a 60GB harddrive, even though in the general description for the Dell 630 laptop, it says an 80GB harddrive. This is still fine by me, because 60 GB from my point of view and my needs, is still substantial, and the device does include all of the features which prompted me to make the purchase in the first place. What I am saying is this: it is usually better to know exactly what you are getting into beforehand.",Dell Latitude D630 14.1-Inch Notebook PC (OS may vary) - Silver,&258
3,Kyle Chapman,"March 20, 2016",1.0 out of 5 stars,Never buy refurb from Discount18!,"Don't do it! Purchased last summer hoping for a not too slow, but also not an extremely high end computer. Somewhere in the middle. Received on August 1st. In the box was a no-name charger, the computer, ""Instructions"" in very broken English, and a disc for Windows XP. At first glance of the computer, looked OK, however the product key on bottom was for Windows Vista Business. Booted it up, and it completed some installation process and booted to the desktop. Came with AVG and Open Office. Pretty sure the copy of XP installed on it was illegal. Fell apart in a few months.As follows is my experience with the ""computer"".8/1/15: not too bad at first, WiFi slow but not that big of a deal. Ran decently fast, given the age. Ran Hard Disk Sentinel on it. 74% health and six bad sectors. Should have raised a red flag right there, but given the age thought it was OK.October 2015, charger burnt out, had to buy a new one. Still OK, the charger had no brand on it anyways.November 2015: starting around here was when it started to slow down bad. Reinstalling Windows did not help, even trying Windows 7 and the new 10.December 2015: burning capability on disk drive stopped working right. Nothing to do with Windows.January 2016, started getting even slower.February 2016, even slower now. Battery is completely toast. Computer started overheating. Cleaning it out did not help. Started to get Blue Screens of Death. Ran the Hard Disk Sentinel. Health is 33% with 59 bad sectors now. This number would gradually increase and the health would go down with it. Slow enough now that watching YouTube became a chore. As I said before, reinstalling Windows helped nothing.March 2016: 81 bad sectors, 23% health. Almost unusable for anything but the most basic tasks. One night I turned it on and it made hideous noises and took like 10 minutes to boot. Now it's 100 bad sectors and rising. Internal fan was not working at this point. Then you get the Blue Screen of Death saying a critical process has been terminated. Then it was done for.Opened it up to find a very old hard drive from an HP computer, and an off brand battery.So if you want an old piece of junk that lasts less than a year, THEN BY ALL MEANS BUY REFURBISHED FROM DISCOUNT18!",Dell Latitude D630 14.1-Inch Notebook PC (OS may vary) - Silver,&258

5,teapot92,"June 30, 2012",4.0 out of 5 stars,How much does a key cost?,"I have purchased several used laptops over the past few years, all totaling in cost less than what a new one would cost. I've had very good luck with two prior to this one. You get a few surprises, such as my spell check was in French, and I'm not French. But, for the most part, I've been very happy. I'm disabled, so I stay on the computer all day, every day. I have 3 lap dogs that stay on me too. They had knocked a couple of my keys off of the keyboard with their nails, and I had a couple of hints that the motherboard might be getting ready to die, so time to replace it. I won't by a new one because I hate the newer operating system they come with. So I ordered another used one. It arrived and seems to be fine, but the letters are worn on several of the keys. It's an issue with me because I'm not a typest, and have to visually see what I'm typing. Really? How much could it have possibly cost to replace a few keys? Oh, when you start your Windows, you have to put the product key numbers in.........it's not on the copy of the CD they send you, but on a microscopic stamp taped to the bottom of the computer. You have to get a magnifying glass, turn the computer upside-down, write the number down, and go from there. Think they could have stuck it on the CD for convience?",Dell Latitude D630 14.1-Inch Notebook PC (OS may vary) - Silver,&258
6,bev snider,"May 14, 2016",5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome value Dell laptop,"I ordered this Dell laptop because I write reviews for Amazon and I needed to be able to post pictures with my reviews and I was unable to do that with my iPhone or Amazon Fire tablet. This comes with Windows XP which is no longer supported by Microsoft. They upgraded it to Windows 7 free of charge. This tablet will not handle Windows 8, but 7 works just fine. Mine came with the power charging cord, very well wrapped and sealed in bubble wrap inside a box. No damage found. It was partially charged and after setting up my email, Amazon and Google Chrome on it, I was able to get my auto form filler set up. I was pleased that this laptop allows me to play, rip and burn CD's with it. The speaker quality is not that great for music, not as loud as I prefer but it has an audio headphone jack that takes the 3.5 mm jack. The computer works great and is really faster than I expected. I am very pleased with this purchase and the customer service is awesome. I'd recommend this to people who want a laptop that runs pretty fast, is perfect for Internet, Facebook and general use. I am able to build my music library and wear headphones to listen, or listen to the built in speaker or hook up an external speaker by either a 3.5 mm jack or USB. There are 4 USB ports as well as hdmi ports. Awesome and perfect for what I need.",Dell Latitude D630 14.1-Inch Notebook PC (OS may vary) - Silver,&258
7,Walker,"February 11, 2013",5.0 out of 5 stars,This was an excilent deal for me,"I was quite surprised when I opened the package and plugged the laptop in.  I was thinking that maybe Tampa Laptops made a mistake and sent me a new computer.  There is not a mark on it anywhere.  Better yet, it even has a larger hard drive than what Amazon advertised.The computer is very fast running XP Pro.  All of the ""older"" software I wanted to use loaded and booted without problem.  So I was good to go in about an hour -- even factoring in playing around with it a lot.  It works on battery, too, although I only had it in use for about 90 minutes and battery operation is not something I really care about.What surprised me is how fast that Dell is.  It seems much faster than my rather new Windows 7 Lenovo with an i5 processor and 6GB of ram.  Cold boot-up to running Firefox on the net and using Word is well under two minutes.  When I loaded Office on it, I was going to make some coffee while waiting.  When I turned around and glanced at the computer, it said it was done already.  I thought it probably didn't load, but it did.Yes, I am very happy with this computer.  This was an excellent deal for me.  I expected an old clunker that I could use just as a writer's platform.  What I received is a fast laptop that will do anything I want and more.",Dell Latitude D630 14.1-Inch Notebook PC (OS may vary) - Silver,&258
8,Alan,"November 5, 2011",2.0 out of 5 stars,not refurbished,"I had a old Dell with a CD drive instead of a DVD drive. I never at any point said I will never buy another Dell. When I wanted a new desktop I bought a Dell. It had no volumn to it which I figure was due to it being from the bottom of the price range and I do not like Windows 7 which is not Dells fault. I had this for several months and never said I will never buy another Dell. I decided I wanted a laptop with wireless internet as I did not have the money to get internet service and with Windows XP. I read the reviews and when I saw that it was a Dell referbished by Dell, I bought one. I will never buy another Dell. The left mouse button constantly clicks by itself. I had to reverse the buttons to be able to use it at all. Even then it causes a lot of problems when I am writing e-mails and other things. When I turn it on The Windows logo comes up and after a while the screen goes grey. Half the time the computer continues normally, but about half the time the computer just sits there and grinds. I have to hold the button down until it goes off. I am on a fixed income which it why I buy low priced computers. It hurts to have to put money aside to repair a refurished computer. Some people trade in their computers because they need or want something new. Others trade in their computers because something is about to break and they do not want to have to get it fixed. You buy these machine it is a crap shoot as to what you are going to get. Dell does not refurbish them, they just reinstall the old software and they do not care it you are ripped off by them.",Dell Latitude D630 14.1-Inch Notebook PC (OS may vary) - Silver,&258
9,Josephine,"March 13, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,good laptop if you want to use windows xp,"A really fast, good laptop if you want to use windows xp, 8, or linux. I could play all the types of media and have yet to try a blueray video file I have on my other hdd at 1920x1050(?) resolution. I know my duocore desktop lagged and this is just a tiny bit slower but this might be able to (different video card).I could play SC2 on this if I wanted. All emulators worked no problem. It's a great laptop and I rarely find myself waiting.With my laptop only...The ""a"" key was very touchy, a small amount of pressure caused it to type. The USBs on the side easily pushed in slightly (but still work) while I pressed on them to check them. Also the screen I got had a few grouped missing pixels that looks like ""ff"" but works fine.I almost sent it back but decided to keep it and it has not failed.",Dell Latitude D630 14.1-Inch Notebook PC (OS may vary) - Silver,&258
10,Jonathan Taub,"June 18, 2015",4.0 out of 5 stars,reliable and inexpensive laptop for light use,"My older laptop was dying and I was looking to get a new one. Intel's next generation CPU Skylake is just around the corner as well as DDR4 memory. With technology, there is always something better around the corner, but these 2 are a major advancement. So I decided to get an inexpensive older computer to use for the time being. I use it for internet, Quickbooks (my financials), and other light use. So it fits my current needs perfectly. I will probably sell it in the future for a few bucks for someone who just needs a computer for light use.The computer is fast enough for my current needs. If you intend on playing video games or do heavy processing (photoshop), this is probably not the laptop for you (it is not meant to do that).

Was extremely pleased that it came with a full MS Office suite installed.Pro:  Everything works, price was rightCon:  A little slow, desktop items a bit small, outside has a few minor scratches, not very clean.I ordered this after returning a new Aesus laptop with Windows 8 which  I don't care for.  Saved about $180, too..Follow up:  I bought this computer for my wife for Christmas, two years ago.  Everything worked as described above until a week ago - when it would no longer access the internet. It appeared the wireless modem had failed.  I figured that was the end of that computer but I just happened to have an old wireless addapter PCMIA card that I hadn't used for years, plugged it in and it worked like new.

12,Andrew Ellis,"August 9, 2015",4.0 out of 5 stars,A good value,"I've gotten to be a fan of these laptops, which I've bought from several vendors.  One was fine for months, then began reporting itself as ""Not Genuine Windows.""  The others are fine.  I converted the ungenuine one to Ubuntu, and it works fine again.  Apart from the OS issue, they are excellent choices, with relatively modern processors.  Upgrade them with a solid-state disk drive and you have a very good laptop.  Unlike many newer laptops, they have both a serial port and an external VGA display output, both of which are useful.  I suggest you inspect them for a certificate of authenticity for whatever  OS they have installed and run Windows Update on it right away to make sure it'll be OK.  The ""Genuine"" one has now upgraded to Windows 10, and it made it fine.",Dell Latitude D630 14.1-Inch Notebook PC (OS may vary) - Silver,&258

15,Barbarianz,"February 28, 2013",4.0 out of 5 stars,Well Worth It,"I purchased this refurbished about 6 months ago and have been more than pleased with it.  Having been a Mac user since the beginning, I did a lot of research before I decided to buy a PC, let alone a used one.  I was not expecting another Mac, but I wanted a good, daily functional workhorse to have as a backup since my Mac is on its last legs.  It does the basics very well, so I have no complaints about that.  It's also nice to have 4 USB ports instead of 2, and to have a few Windows programs that have proven useful.My only complaint is that the battery is dead within 6 months.

All I wanted is something to use offline, a graphics art program.  I do not want to be online with this laptop - I use a desktop for that - because I don't want to worry about viruses or hackers etc.  messing with my art projects.  Therefore I can't comment on how it works online.The program, Painter X  (X stands for 10, not X rated!), works just as fast and well as it does on my brand new Dell laptop. Ditto Windows XP.  I don't know about the battery since I plan to pretty much leave it in the same spot and keep it plugged in.  Everything looks virtually new.

I'm not a gamer, so I don't need blazing speed.  I write and do research.  For my klutzy fingers, touch typing on this keyboard is more comfortable than on a newer Dell laptop (15-3521) I also own.  This model was just what I wanted, and for a month now I've been using it and singing its praises!  If it gives me a year or two, which other used D630s have, I'll have no complaints.",Dell Latitude D630 14.1-Inch Notebook PC (OS may vary) - Silver,&258
30,M. Eames,"August 27, 2013",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect casual laptop - very sturdy,"A great laptop to take on a business trip or vacation.  It won't sting too badly if it's broken or ""lost"".I replaced the 80gig hdd with a 250 gig ssd and added 1 gig of memory to bring it to 3 gig total.  It boots up very quickly. The battery works fine but still for $25 I replaced it with a 9-cell long life battery.It showed me all the available wireless networks.It's now running win 7 pro 32 bit.  The 2.2ghz dual core processor is fast enough to play my hi def movies just fine (Of course the screen is not hi def). I did not expect it to be able to play my movies, it was a nice surprise.",Dell Latitude D630 14.1-Inch Notebook PC (OS may vary) - Silver,&258
31,tikiboss,"March 29, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,Put Linux on it !,Editing previous review. The laptop came installed with windows 7 64 bit which was running very slow.I decided to do some research and i found linux is great and will revive an old laptop. I installed peppermint 5 OS (32 bit)and this laptop is running so smooth and has a nice sleek interface (which once you get to know linux) you cancustomize and make it look great. I would recommend anyone who has bought this laptop for school or generaluse to install linux especially the lightweight distros like peppermint of lubuntu. Good stuff can't go wrong.Btw if you didn't know the DVD/CD caddy can pull out and you can slide in an additional battery and or HD.,Dell Latitude D630 14.1-Inch Notebook PC (OS may vary) - Silver,&258
32,Sparkey,"September 23, 2013",4.0 out of 5 stars,I work overseas in a developing country and everyone wants a computer.,"The problem is they can not afford a new one. I have purchased dozens over the last few years, and places like EKAGS has supplied good quality machines at a reasonable price. Every once and a wile you will get a lemon, but it makes a difference who you deal with ( what the outcome will be. )  Recently that happened and I got a quick response, and returned the notebook and was sent another Dell.  Many Thanks, Sparkey",Dell Latitude D630 14.1-Inch Notebook PC (OS may vary) - Silver,&258

For starters, it says the OS is Windows 7 but it was Vista. The wifi switch is broken in the off position, so I had to buy a wifi adapter for it. Now, three months later, the hard drive is dying and has to be replaced. It's an old laptop and very rugged, still in good condition for all that so it's not a total loss, but I'm definitely disappointed.",Dell Latitude D630 14.1-Inch Notebook PC (OS may vary) - Silver,&258

I couldn't change the volume of some of the screen settings or the power settings. I ordered a recovery cd from a 3rd party in January (haven't received it yet). I bought this Laptop for a job that didn't come though, but I am planning to use it as a back up or to use on trips so if I do lose it no real big deal.

35,Ward Scott Watson,"January 17, 2012",4.0 out of 5 stars,Well worth the price,"This computer is a great novice computer, it has all the necessary features of an entry level PC, without the junk that is usually installed. The RAM installed is adaquate, however an additional megabyte makes this PC work much better. This PC has no media slots, stereo speakers, web camera, or microphone, each of which can be purchased later.

But the computer itself was everything I was hoping for.  So the computer itself - five stars.  The company that refurbished it and sold it to me gets a negative two stars for not bothering to make sure the power cord  or the battery worked.

As this was my first venture into the laptop realm, I wanted to do my home work.The Dell Latitude D630 fit almost everything on my list. I was concerned however about getting a pre owned laptop. But I made the plunge and came out very satisfied. It is fast, clean, smooth and most of all, priced right. With shipping I paid a little over 200.00 bucks.If you are looking for a laptop as a home use or for business this is an outstanding choice. I may purchase another one for my wife at this price.",Dell Latitude D630 14.1-Inch Notebook PC (OS may vary) - Silver,&258
41,Amazon Customer,"August 11, 2012",5.0 out of 5 stars,Refurbished Dell Latitude D630,I purchased this laptop to give myself something to tinker with while recovering from surgery.  The system has been working perfectly for the last 2 months and is probably the best bang for the buck for a laptop refurb.The versitility of this machine allows for a second battery or hard drive to be installed in the module bay.  I purchased a used docking station which also includes a bay where the battery can be charged or the HD or DVD-ROM module can be used.It is always a roll of the dice when you buy refurbed or used computers and parts and sometimes you will get a defective unit but I am very happy with this purchase.,Dell Latitude D630 14.1-Inch Notebook PC (OS may vary) - Silver,&258
42,SirTopp'mHat,"March 10, 2012",5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than new,I received my latitude with a 2.2 ghz cpu and 2 gigs of ram a week after I ordered it. Right out of the box it started up fine and the battery lasted for 6 hours. The only obvious sign of wear was on the bottom side. I loaded a 3d CAD program onto it and it performs great and runs cool. That is exactly why I love a laptop with XP. Also included was a dvd-rw drive and all for the lowest price on the net...  I have also received a monitor stand and d-port replicator from amazon and everything works fine. I will be buying refurbished from now on as new computers simply aren't worth the money.,Dell Latitude D630 14.1-Inch Notebook PC (OS may vary) - Silver,&258
