0,M. Gomez,"December 5, 2019",3.0 out of 5 stars,BEWARE ! This Dell Inspiron 2 in 1 comes with Windows 10 S !!!,"Just unboxed this little ditty nd completed the initial set up once I got connected to the internet. That process took less time than it took to open the boxes! First critique is that there is no charging light or indicator - that would be useful so I would know if the Unit was operating or even charging. A backlight to the power ON key would have been useful in a similar vein. It's weight and size is perfect for what I wanted and the touch screen is quite nice and reactive. The keyboard is not quite as springy as I am used to but given the laptop's size and weight that can be forgiven. I wanted something light and portable and I have definitely found that. The most major critique I have however is that contrary to what was advertised on this site - this particular device comes with Windows 10S and NOT Windows. Of course this was only discovered when I tried to make the switch to the much preferred Chrome Browser as opposed to WIndows Edge. I mean they did try to hard sell the Edge browser during set up, but I would much rather prefer Chrome due to it's user friendliness and accessibility across my devices. I feel somewhat hoodwinked by the seller! So now to consult You Tube and Google on how to switch out of S Mode and go about my business. With some more usage I may update this review.","Dell Inspiron 11 3195, 2 in 1, 7th Gen AMD A9-9420e W/ Radeon R5 Graphics, 4GB DDR4 2666MHz RAM, 64GB HD, 11.6"" HD (1366 X 768) LED-Backlit Touch Display (i3195-A525GRY-PUS)",&229
1,Tweakes182,"July 18, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great Bang for the Buck.... But it is not Performance Driven,"It packs a good amount of features into the little notebook. Bigger screen, touch screen and decent performance. It does struggle to keep with some applications especially if you try to multi-task.","Dell Inspiron 11 3195, 2 in 1, 7th Gen AMD A9-9420e W/ Radeon R5 Graphics, 4GB DDR4 2666MHz RAM, 64GB HD, 11.6"" HD (1366 X 768) LED-Backlit Touch Display (i3195-A525GRY-PUS)",&229
2,mizfly,"April 23, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Not much hard drive space.,Did not like being unable to upgrade the hard drive.  Hard drive space is very limited and fills up quickly.

3,Robert P Knowles,"April 25, 2021",3.0 out of 5 stars,Storage space,Hard drive space not upgradable and at 64gb not enough space available to store my data. One drive seems to take up a lot of space on local hard drive. Even tried to move pictures and music directory’s to a D drive but Still not allowing to free up space. Would recommend purchasing unit with large store capacity upfront and not counting on upgrading.,"Dell Inspiron 11 3195, 2 in 1, 7th Gen AMD A9-9420e W/ Radeon R5 Graphics, 4GB DDR4 2666MHz RAM, 64GB HD, 11.6"" HD (1366 X 768) LED-Backlit Touch Display (i3195-A525GRY-PUS)",&229
4,Thomas Jonsberg,"June 23, 2020",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Adequate, you get what you pay for","Fine for a $400 tablet/notebook thingy to play Spotify, watch Netflix in bed, or pretend to write a novel at Starbucks. Battery life is okay, roughly 2-3 hours with a brightish screen. Screen viewing angle is garbage, like 20-30 degrees max. Streams well enough, built in speakers are all right, doubles as a personal heater with extended use.  Got it to replace my faithful Asus Transformer and while it does almost everything Tiny did a little bit better, I'm not inspired to give it a name.","Dell Inspiron 11 3195, 2 in 1, 7th Gen AMD A9-9420e W/ Radeon R5 Graphics, 4GB DDR4 2666MHz RAM, 64GB HD, 11.6"" HD (1366 X 768) LED-Backlit Touch Display (i3195-A525GRY-PUS)",&229
5,Augusto Gabanzo,"January 20, 2021",2.0 out of 5 stars,This Feels like a nice value when you read about it in the reviews but oh boy you are wrong,"My sad problem with this item was the product support. Mouse and keyboard started failing as soon as we 1st got it, Dell made us update bios, run tests and many of the normal things, as it does work when you power it up. its clearly not a hardware failure they can just replace. SO everything keyboard or mouse die we just have to power it down and power it up again, soft or hard reset doesn't work have to power it down. Don't waste money on this, it isn't slow it isn't fast it works well as a tablet if only windows didn't kick those ""usb"" devices out i could rule. But sadly windows does, they become ""PS2"" and stop working. Lets hope amazon doesn't delete this review so you all  can stay away from this product.","Dell Inspiron 11 3195, 2 in 1, 7th Gen AMD A9-9420e W/ Radeon R5 Graphics, 4GB DDR4 2666MHz RAM, 64GB HD, 11.6"" HD (1366 X 768) LED-Backlit Touch Display (i3195-A525GRY-PUS)",&229

7,Richard H.,"January 5, 2020",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Value,"I purchased this  for a total of about 180 with a 20 dollar discount. Great xmas gift for my mom. I was concerned about the 4 gigs of ram being adequate but it works fine with Windows S. Also, Dell, even on inexpensive products does not have to solder in the memory module. If need be in can be upgraded to 8. Only one slot so you would have to get an 8gb stick. SSD is soldered but for sub 200 bucks I can forgive this. An SD card would be an easy fix to this.","Dell Inspiron 11 3195, 2 in 1, 7th Gen AMD A9-9420e W/ Radeon R5 Graphics, 4GB DDR4 2666MHz RAM, 64GB HD, 11.6"" HD (1366 X 768) LED-Backlit Touch Display (i3195-A525GRY-PUS)",&229

We both like the keyboard a lot.  The problem is that ours insanely slow!!!  Thenit crashes!!  He can't do any school work or zoom which is what I bought it for.  He's still able to do it on his tiny Nuvision, which I paid much less for!!  I called Dell te h support and they didn't help at all.

41,T,"March 8, 2020",1.0 out of 5 stars,Never going to purchase like computer again,Would not purchase again. Crashed two of my external hard drives. Turns itself off in the middle of operatiins. Can not make a backup of my phone to an external without crashing. I am so disappointed in this Dell computer. First Dell I purchased and appears to be my last. I don't play video games or stream movies but I don't feel like it can handle that. I used ms suites and it crashes on me. Would think its a virus but it has windows s mode (which obviously doesn't work) not to mention limits usage on apps and programs I know are good and I like.

42,Dan Riola,"September 26, 2020",1.0 out of 5 stars,Biggest piece of junk and even worser technical support.,This computer is a piece of junk.  It froze and was slow from the beginning.  Dell's tech support  the worst.  I tried to work through them to have it fixed and it dragged on.  To make matters worse the 1 year warranty starts form some random date the computer was made not form the date you bought it.  So now 9 months into owning this computer I have an expensive paper weight.  Do not buy this.,"Dell Inspiron 11 3195, 2 in 1, 7th Gen AMD A9-9420e W/ Radeon R5 Graphics, 4GB DDR4 2666MHz RAM, 64GB HD, 11.6"" HD (1366 X 768) LED-Backlit Touch Display (i3195-A525GRY-PUS)",&229
