0,JWCARLON,"June 17, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Far exceeded expectations,"Laptop arrived in good order.  Using the product ID on back searched Dell and updated bios and drivers. Performance, battery life and backlit keyboard are all great.  Screen quality is just ok, but movies look good  Screen is good enough.  Audio is great!  Lots of ports!This laptop is light/portable and based on all above far better than expected.  For these reasons even though years older than my newer Dell I'm using this one a lot more.As I plan on using this a lot more than planned, I upgraded RAM to 16 gb (super easy).  I bought a webcam to attach when I need to do video calls.  I upgraded to Window 11.  Now Dell will tell you it's not supported.  But I found a list on Dell where this laptop was tested with Windows 11.  I did run the utility to upgrade boot from MBR to GPT and set bios to secure boot.  found steps online.  Just ran one command.  Rebooted and set bios.  Was good to go.  This laptop has an older version of TPM than Windows 11 would prefer, but was only yellow on Windows 11 pre-check.  But the one red item was this processor just missed Windows 11 cutoff.  I found online an approach to bypass the Windows 11 check and this worked great.  Windows 11 installed and is running with no issues.  Was able to install Windows 11 as an upgrade so kept all my files and settings  Performs as well when WIndows10.For the $$ this was a great purchase.",Dell Latitude 5480 | 14 inch Business Laptop | Intel i5-6300U | 8GB DDR4 | 256GB SSD | Backlit Keyboard | Win 10 Pro (Renewed),&220
