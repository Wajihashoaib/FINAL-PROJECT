0,Donna301,"August 16, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for the price!,"This laptop is a great value. I use it for basic stuff and don't take it anywhere. The lid/screen is somewhere flexible and when you press the keys, you can see the case press down as well, so I'm not sure it would hold up to a lot of rough use. But if you're looking for a good, basic laptop for home computing, this model is a great value.","Dell Inspiron 15 3511 15.6 Inch Laptop, Full HD LED Non-Touch WVA Display - Intel Core i3-1115G4, 8GB DDR4 RAM, 256GB SSD, Intel UHD Graphics, Windows 11 Home - Carbon Black",&560

There's a great video on YouTube called Dell inspiron hinge calibration. Mine lasted less than 6 months before the plastic broke. Thankfully the screen was unharmed. I was able to repair it with the super glue - Baking soda trick.Otherwise, it's a great laptop.","Dell Inspiron 15 3511 15.6 Inch Laptop, Full HD LED Non-Touch WVA Display - Intel Core i3-1115G4, 8GB DDR4 RAM, 256GB SSD, Intel UHD Graphics, Windows 11 Home - Carbon Black",&560

11,Laura M.,"March 17, 2022",1.0 out of 5 stars,No Ethernet Jack & Known issue with hinge breaking,"I downgraded this review. See below.I didn't read the specs carefully enough. This does not have an Ethernet jack to plug into the internet.  I was able to order an adapter to plug the Ethernet cable into a USB port. I could have ordered the dock, but that would have added an extra $250 and at that price I should have just bought the upgraded version.The cheaper models of Dell have a known issue where the hinge on the monitor breaks. The screws come loose and if you are not watching, it will damage the plastic around the monitor. I leave my computer on a desk. When I do travel with it, I carry it in a padded laptop case. After 5 months of gentle use, this should not be a problem. I'm shipping it off to Dell for a repair. Technically I'm still under Basic warranty but we know they will still charge me for it. There is a long list of these complaints on the Dell support site about this and the company is not doing anything about it.","Dell Inspiron 15 3511 15.6 Inch Laptop, Full HD LED Non-Touch WVA Display - Intel Core i3-1115G4, 8GB DDR4 RAM, 256GB SSD, Intel UHD Graphics, Windows 11 Home - Carbon Black",&560

30,University Doc,"June 24, 2022",2.0 out of 5 stars,Great at 1st. Touchpad died less than 4 mos of use....,"I was excited to get this new laptop. Not that I wanted one, but Microsoft makes one buy one with Windows 11: I began having issues with my Windows 10 laptop since Windows 11 was announced. 1st, thanks to a local delivery company, delivery was very late on this laptop. Very late and when calling them, they had no idea what was going on. When we contacted Off--- --x, they had no idea what was going on either and didn’t even care. In fact, if we didn’t phone the delivery company, it would never have been delivered. O----- --x was no help in tracking or getting this laptop to us. Shame on O---- --x. A helpful supervisor did take the time to give us a credit but couldn’t do anything else.  I do love the speed of the laptop. It is quite fast. The speakers are lousy. Even on highest level, it is low and tinny. Horrible for a laptop like this. I have two older laptops that have better speakers. However, the biggest con with this laptop is its lack of durability and reliability. Within just 3-1/2 months of use, the touchpad and mouse failed. Can't use it. Through remote testing Dell made the diagnosis that it failed and informed me that they would send me a replacement per the warranty. I am to send the broken one back or have to pay for it. After waiting a week, I checked on Dell.com to find out the status. No status showed and all I could find was, ""Resolution Pending"". What does that mean? I have no idea. Just how long am I supposed to wait to get a replacement part? I can’t use the laptop without it. I don’t like the touchscreen. I would think under warranty the replacement part would have been shipped out directly. No need to say how very disappointed I am in this purchase. The price at the time I purchased in in late February 2022 seemed reasonable. After this, all I can say that it was and is now still overpriced. Save your money and purchase another brand. And I miss having a CD/DVD recorder/player. As with everything else, size shrinks and prices go up. Overall, this purchase was a big nightmare: from the lousy shipping company; Do----- shipping of Jackson, MS to the failed touchpad/mouse, and lack of efficient warranty service and response. I'm not pleased at all. Sorry, but I can’t recommend this pc at all. I guess I should have listed to the rest of the negative reviews at Off----ax.","Dell Inspiron 15 3511 15.6 Inch Laptop, Full HD LED Non-Touch WVA Display - Intel Core i3-1115G4, 8GB DDR4 RAM, 256GB SSD, Intel UHD Graphics, Windows 11 Home - Carbon Black",&560
