2,John Street,"January 2, 2019",4.0 out of 5 stars,Buyer beware!  Might not have optical drive,"Be prepared to find your new laptop does NOT have an optical drive installed.  That's what I discovered but only after being a long ways into the setup.  Already had personal info on the machine, set up for email, etc.  After call to Dell [who was not the 3rd party seller, so had no control over this listing] determined this laptop never had one installed coming off the assembly line.  Contacted Amazon who initially offered refund/exchange but I was really reluctant to do that, first of all because I would have had to scrub this one of personal information and second because they couldn't tell me if the missing drive was a one time occurrence or whether all of them being sold by this vendor were without.  Finally they offered me a partial refund to cover the value of the missing drive.  I opted for that and ordered one [refurb] from Dell that I can install.Having said all that, we like the machine and have no other issues at this point other than discovering Windows 10 has eliminated the Homegroup function so I had to do some research on how to connect to our home networked printer.  Not difficult.I'm giving the laptop 4 stars, the seller not so good for the erroneous listing (or item delivered).",Dell Inspiron 15.6 Inch HD Touchscreen Flagship High Performance Laptop PC | Intel Core i5-7200U | 8GB Ram | 256GB SSD | Bluetooth | WiFi | Windows 10 (Black),&527

Very inconvenient for a right handed person.  Every time I left click the pad, it's as if I'm right clicking.

5,Heather,"February 6, 2020",3.0 out of 5 stars,Windows 10 in S Mode,"This computer comes with Windows 10 in S Mode, which is similar to a Safe Mode or a parental control mode. It can easily be turned off by going into Settings, Update and Security, Activation, and clicking where it states ""Turn off S Mode."" You will need a Microsoft account in order to do this as you have to download it from the Microsoft Store. Once you do this, you can restart the unit and it will display Windows 10 Home with a fully activated license. We purchased a large number of these to use for my company and it is severely annoying that I have to do these steps to each individual one.Touch screen feels cheap but it does function. I am not thrilled with the LCD-like touchscreen, definitely does not feel sturdy and I am worried that overuse will eventually lead to damages. The seller should be more descriptive in their products but alas, I have no further complaints. It is a fast little machine and installed the updates in a matter of minutes, relatively large updates as well. I was quite impressed with that. All in all, I rate this a 3 because it should be in the description as being Windows 10 in S mode even though there is a work-around to it.",Dell Inspiron 15.6 Inch HD Touchscreen Flagship High Performance Laptop PC | Intel Core i5-7200U | 8GB Ram | 256GB SSD | Bluetooth | WiFi | Windows 10 (Black),&527
6,Manda,"December 30, 2019",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Solid laptop- no cd drive, slightly awkward keyboard","I purchased my laptop a few months ago, and have mostly loved it! I have only used the touchscreen a few times, so am learning it's not a priority/necessity for me... maybe if the monitor swiveled so it was more like a tablet? Still a cool feature. I have struggled with the touchpad being slightly off center, so I end up hitting the right-click when I mean to left-click, or my palm touches the pad and messes with the mouse. Also, the keys on the board are about halfway up the keyboard, and spread out. Took a long time to get used to this layout. Most recently I discovered that this laptop doesn't have a cd rom! I didn't even know to look to make sure that it did have one! I thought it was a basic laptop function, but I hear more and more laptops are being created without them. Apparently cd drives allow a lot of dust inside the computer, and often lead to internal errors. External cd/dvd drives can be purchased for pretty cheap.For the most part this is a great laptop- it's just taking some getting used to! If you're picky about laptops, go to a store to feel out the keyboard. Don't know if I will order a laptop online again!",Dell Inspiron 15.6 Inch HD Touchscreen Flagship High Performance Laptop PC | Intel Core i5-7200U | 8GB Ram | 256GB SSD | Bluetooth | WiFi | Windows 10 (Black),&527

8,HR,"March 25, 2021",1.0 out of 5 stars,Hinge and Screen fell apart after 18 months and had to replace the keyboard - Over $900 spent,"I did not realize that this model did not include a DVD drive so I had to buy one. After less than 18 months, I noticed the right hinge was popping out. That lead to me calling Dell and they were of no use, etc. and wanted $160 to analyze it. I called a local computer tech and that led to needing to replace the keyboard. Now I am faced with not being able to close the lid as the hinge issue has caused the screen to fall apart and separate. I have no idea what the repair will be this time and am faced with having to pay for an extensive body repair or buy a replacement computer. I do not recommend this product or if you do buy it, pay for the extended warranty. I have owned this computer since Dec 2018 and have already put more than $200 into it.April 5, 2021 Update: Today's repair was an additional $265. The tech had to replace the laptop body and said that he has never seen such brittle plastic in his 20 years of experience. Not only did all the little rivet's fall out, but three of the hinge screws were broken out of the plastic. What was even more depressing was that the replacement body's screen is not a touch screen as I had before. Overall, do not buy this unit. I have owned or possessed at least 16 Dells over the years via business and personal use. I am not down on Dell, but this laptop really stinks. I have over $900 invested in this laptop now. Had I had known that I would no longer have a touch screen (my first BTW), I would have just purchased a new laptop.",Dell Inspiron 15.6 Inch HD Touchscreen Flagship High Performance Laptop PC | Intel Core i5-7200U | 8GB Ram | 256GB SSD | Bluetooth | WiFi | Windows 10 (Black),&527
9,MamaKat,"October 14, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Tremendous Value,"Thankfully, the listing has been updated to state no optical drive.  When I bought it, it said it had a DVD/RW.  I was disappointed but decided to keep it.  Honestly, I haven't missed the drive.  The touch screen is great.  The picture is great.  Having a solid state drive is GREAT.  Lightning fast even with the bloated, resource hog known as Windows 10.  I game with this laptop and it keeps up pretty good.It's not really a gamer, but it WILL game in a pinch. Dell name, touch screen, ssd, windows loaded, core it, all for under $500.  If you can live without an optical drive (come on, its 2019), it's a fantastic bargain.",Dell Inspiron 15.6 Inch HD Touchscreen Flagship High Performance Laptop PC | Intel Core i5-7200U | 8GB Ram | 256GB SSD | Bluetooth | WiFi | Windows 10 (Black),&527
10,Leon And Antoinette ,"December 29, 2019",4.0 out of 5 stars,Product not as described,Product not as described. Order information said Windows 10 Home was installed on the computer. The box said Windows 10 Home. When I turned the computer on it said Windows 10 Pro S mode was installed and it kept prompting me to buy Windows 10 Pro for and additional $199 in order to switch out of S mode.

13,TECHNolli,"January 6, 2020",5.0 out of 5 stars,Did you think it wouldn't be any good?  Well it's EXCELLENT!," I loved this laptop for the first 2 months, then it started having these bubbles pop up out of nowhere and I am unable to do anything at that point. When it first started, all I had to do was restart the laptop. Now no matter what I do it doesn't go away, I called Microsoft to see what they could do, I have them troubleshoot over the phone while screen sharing with a tech only for them to crash the laptop. I found a Microsoft office here in MN and I brought the laptop there to have it reboot only for them to tell me my files are all gone. I have only had this computer since April and at this point I am frustrated. All my school work, my apps for school, all gone. After Microsoft did what they, (wiping) the laptop, I went for it back since i needed it for school only for the issue to start back again even worse this time. I got this back only 2 weeks ago.

This was purchased to be a field tech laptop but we were using it in office and in the middle of working in only chrome browser sessions, the laptop would crash and blue screen with different messages such as ""critical process dies"" or ""unknown fatal error occurred"" with some code that when i looked up was useless information. I tried to return the PC but after troubleshooting and letting it sit I was 6 days past the 30 day warranty. I troubleshot with Dell support and performed multiple remote sessions with them to reset and diagnose the problem and they could not figure it out.
