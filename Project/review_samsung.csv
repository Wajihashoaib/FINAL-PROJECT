0,0,Steph,"May 11, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth every penny!,"After spending alot of time researching many different chromebooks, tablets and laptops in the $200-500 that would best suit my needs I found myself getting frustrated and overwhelmed by the process and was about 30 seconds from giving up and settling on one that was not ideal just to get the process over with. That is when this beauty miraculously appeared! Not only did it check 9 out of 10 of the boxes I needed it to, it was also 1/2 the price compared to others I researched in this category.  I love the design and versatility of having a laptop and tablet in one option.  I also like that unlike some of the other 2 in 1 chromebooks it is not flimsy and they clearly took into consideration the lifestyle needs of a 2 in 1 chromebook keeping it lightweight yet very sturdy. The battery life is wonderful, it charges quickly and a full charged has lasted me over a full day at work as I used it continuously for a total of 10.45hrs before it got down to the red at 15%. And that was without turning on the battery saver option! The display is clean, crisp & vivid. Whether it's used for streaming a movie or creating a new document, you will be satisfied with the visuals for sure. Set up was a breeze as was learning the ins and outs of all this chromebook offers. The only ""complaint"" I have in regards to this specific model is the lack of protective cases designed to fit it. I understand this is not a issue about the product itself but I did want to make people aware of it as there is only 1 brand of hard cover cases that fit it and do not have to be removed for use(mCover hard shell case for 12.2in Samsung v2 chromebook).I highly recommend also using a padded waterproof shock absorbent carry case as well for travel, as the hard case is mainly to protect from scratches and dings and WILL NOT protect it in the event it is dropped, banged or similar.  The other recommendation is a 9H screen protector, especially if you plan to use the touch screen and stylist pen options. If I could give it 10stars I would.  Hands down this is the best purchase I have made this year, I only wish I found it sooner!","Samsung Chromebook Plus V2, 2-in-1, 4GB RAM, 32GB eMMC, 13MP Camera, Chrome OS, 12.2"", 16:10 Aspect Ratio, Light Titan (XE520QAB-K01US)",&299,review1.csv

2,2,chizzie,"June 26, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Delightfully happy!,"I purchased this on PRIME day and got a really great deal. :)I've only ever used Apple products.... and the last laptop I purchased in 2010 was a Macbook Air. Needlesstoday, it's now super outdated and, given that my email, photos and browsing is always on Google, it made sense to move to a Chromebook. Sorry Apple. But I'm still loyal to your iPhone.WHAT I LIKE about my NEW CHROMEBOOK!>> I like the keyboard! Unlike a mac where I felt like I could barely feel the keys, I can 'feel 'the keys on this pc and typing seems easier.>> Ease of use: Charge and GO!  Upon receipt, just charge your Chromebook right away. Then, open 'er up, put in your google credentials and you're on your way.>>Screen: well lit, colors are great.>>Sound: EXCELLENT.  Clear, sharp, great stereo sound. (ha, stereo! I needed to call that out? I'm a 70s girl so, yeah.)>> Consider getting yourself a wireless mouse with a beanbag wrist rest, and, pick up a microSD card to give your little machine more storage. I'm not big on touch pads so, call me old school but I like using a mouse :)>> FUN FACTOR: It's just a fun machine.  I like it! And I haven't even tried the stylus or other cool features yet!WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:>> so far - there's nothing that I don't like about this Chromebook. Happy customer right here! And this was after (seriously people) agonizing over 3+ hours over WHICH brand to buy.  I'm glad I went with Samsung!>> Oh, there is this one thing. AMAZON: why would you package this sleek, cool Samsung Chromebook in a GIGANTIC, over-sized box that looked like it could have held about 8 Chromebooks?  The machine (which was packed in its own box) was 100% jostling around in transit. There's no doubt. There was the thought of a small, crumpled amount of brown paper packing material that was in there for... show? Because you would have needed about 25 pieces of crumpled brown packing material to have secured the Chromebook.","Samsung Chromebook Plus V2, 2-in-1, 4GB RAM, 32GB eMMC, 13MP Camera, Chrome OS, 12.2"", 16:10 Aspect Ratio, Light Titan (XE520QAB-K01US)",&299,review1.csv

5,5,Person,"February 1, 2020",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome battery life, heavier than expected, pen is fine","I like this computer.I received it yesterday and spent the entire evening getting used to it. The laptop comes with a stylus, and a power cable. I think it's made of plastic but it feels pretty solid, and it's way heavier than I expected. I fear I may drop it because of it's weight. Out of the box it has no power, you must plug it in to the wall with your provided cable.Some issues are that there is one dead pixel that has been present ever since I turned on the device. I don't really care for it as it's so tiny, but I know that some may not be okay with it for it appears to be an irremovable speck of dirt. Another issue is that the stylus has a bit of delay. Another is that the scrolling is a bit wonky in Android apps, I can not use two fingers on the mouse pad to scroll in the Discord app for example, but I can use the pen/my finger to operate it from the screen as I would on my phone. This makes sense since it is an Android app after all, but it'd be nice to not have to switch back and forth from laptop to pen abilities. The app drawer is only properly functionable when using the pen or your finger.I fell asleep with it the laptop on, and woke several hours later. My battery did not empty in my absence of activity, and none of my progress was lost. Though it did not lock my screen, but I am pretty sure I can fix that in the settings. I am just amazed that it did not die and nothing was lost even though I left it for several hours. The laptop is also extremely quiet I now realize, I have not heard a single mechanical noise coming from it and I am typing this from a silent room.Also, Chrome OS isn't that bad, I had planned to attempt to download Ubuntu on it, I am still going to get it to have more useful software available, but I will also use Chrome OS since it's not as bad as I thought it would be.Overall the computer is pretty epic","Samsung Chromebook Plus V2, 2-in-1, 4GB RAM, 32GB eMMC, 13MP Camera, Chrome OS, 12.2"", 16:10 Aspect Ratio, Light Titan (XE520QAB-K01US)",&299,review1.csv
6,6,David Edwards,"March 27, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's more like ""2/3 laptop, 1/3 tablet"" rather than a 2-in-1.","I've been in the market for a cheap laptop for work for a while.  I have a hefty gaming PC at home but I wanted something completely separate and portable for non-gaming needs like using the internet and word processing.  Additionally I've been trying to read more and sometimes this leads to me using the Kindle app on my phone.  I was drawn to the Chromebook Plus (V2) because of the attempts to make it more like a tablet and utilize Android apps.Overall the product works exactly as described.  The screen is good, though the default settings make the things like the app shelf, window borders, and pointer size a little too large in comparison to the parts of the screen in use.  This is variable once you poke around the settings, though, and I have no complaints.  The keyboard is fantastic and responsive.  The touchscreen is pretty good, though it's not quite on par with the perfection that is an iPad touch screen.  Sometimes I miss when I try to click on things with my finger or perhaps it doesn't register at all.  That happens so infrequently that it's still entirely usable.  The pen is also nice, though I've only used it so far to doodle in the Google Keep notes app as it was not a main selling point for me.  The battery life is about on par with what is advertised; I used it lightly from 7:30-2:30 yesterday, for example, and it only got to about 50%.  The foldability for tent and tablet mode is a little bit awkward considering the size and the fact that the keyboard is always attached, but it works.  It just makes me prefer it as a laptop more than a tablet most of the time.The performance is acceptable considering the hardware.  With my other machine having a much more powerful processor and more RAM, I actually do notice a bit of delay in navigation online and when using multiple apps.  With that said, it's not bad at all, and the comparison is actually rather unfair.My main complaint is really only the quality of the touchpad for using the cursor.  It works well, but it's a little bit choppy and doesn't respond to light and subtle movements when trying to be precise.  Again, this might be unfair because the only recent laptops I've used have been MacBooks and those touchpads are incredibly smooth, but it's still worth pointing out.Overall I'm highly satisfied with my purchase.  The problems I've described really aren't even problems but rather little quirks that I've already gotten used to.  It works for everything you'd want a Chromebook to work for and it does it well.","Samsung Chromebook Plus V2, 2-in-1, 4GB RAM, 32GB eMMC, 13MP Camera, Chrome OS, 12.2"", 16:10 Aspect Ratio, Light Titan (XE520QAB-K01US)",&299,review1.csv

8,8,bthsllnk,"October 5, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good Chromebook well worth the money,"I bought this chromebook plus v2 used, it was supposed to have blemishes on the back. But so far I haven't found any. It looks and acts like new. I needed to replace my old acer chromebook that was starting to freeze up. So far I'm very happy with this Samsung chromebook. It's still under warrenty, the keyboard is very responsive and clicky. I use it mainly for work, editing videos, photos then uploading them to my website. Granted I've only had it for a few days but it's been very fast without any lag. I typically have about 8-10 tabs open at a time, this hasn't caused any slow downs. It got about 3 updates when I got it up and running. It's now on chrome 93.0.4577.95. Having the s-pen is also a bonus since I do some journaling. So far I'm happy with my purchase. It is a bit heavy so keep that in mind. Battery life is about average nothing great. I do wish that each side had a usb C port instead of them both on the left side. But the charging cord is long so I'm making due.","Samsung Chromebook Plus V2, 2-in-1, 4GB RAM, 32GB eMMC, 13MP Camera, Chrome OS, 12.2"", 16:10 Aspect Ratio, Light Titan (XE520QAB-K01US)",&299,review1.csv

So I bought it because if the features that come with it and it seemed like a cool computer to have. WRONG! With all the cool things this thing can do it can’t even run photoshop, it can only run photoshop express and they are not the same. It’s basically an android phone but on a foldable laptop. Didn’t bother checking out any of the other features because it’s not what I wanted. But if you want a small laptop for drawing and playing games on then this is perfect. I wish there was real reviews letting customers know the specifics cause it may have been delivered fast but it’s ultimately a waste of time.","Samsung Chromebook Plus V2, 2-in-1, 4GB RAM, 32GB eMMC, 13MP Camera, Chrome OS, 12.2"", 16:10 Aspect Ratio, Light Titan (XE520QAB-K01US)",&299,review1.csv

11,11,Ian B,"November 24, 2018",3.0 out of 5 stars,Decent convertible with tradeoffs,"This is a decent hybrid and good for basic browser/tablet tasks. If you try to do much more with it, you might be disappointed. I'm ok with the $350 Black Friday price, but would be disappointed if I spent $500 on this, so giving it 3 stars instead of 4. Paying $600 for the m3 processor would be too much for this class of device, especially with only 4gb ram. It does fine for browsing, but Android apps can be kind of glitchy.  Touch responsiveness can be spotty in tablet mode. This might be ChromeOS' fault, but it's an advertised feature and should be expected to work. Using a 2k external monitor over usb-c works, but is choppy. I'm guessing this is a combination of the low ram and integrated graphics (cpu usage wasn't high). I wouldn't do it regularly. I like that is has 2 usb-c ports, but putting them both on the same side is annoying. The screen half is much heavier than other laptops I've used and makes it hard to balance on your lap. The camera on the body is pointless unless you plan to take photos in tablet mode (don't be that person). The keyboard is fine, but the touchpad is a little cramped. This just comes with the territory on this size device.Basically it does a lot of things adequately and not much more. If you're ok with that, you might like it. For the price, you could get a much better tablet or laptop, but this gives you a little of both.Pros:- USB-C- Screen- Stylus- Size- Build qualityCons:- Speed/responsiveness- Weight (top-heavy screen)- Thickness- Price","Samsung Chromebook Plus V2, 2-in-1, 4GB RAM, 32GB eMMC, 13MP Camera, Chrome OS, 12.2"", 16:10 Aspect Ratio, Light Titan (XE520QAB-K01US)",&299,review1.csv

13,13,Joanne Wolfe,"June 28, 2019",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice, but buyer beware","The Samsung Chromebook V2 is a super nice product; however, buyers beware that this particular item did NOT have a mobile device chip installed, necessitating my purchasing a $99 Jetpak from Verizon in order to get their unlimited wi-fi plan. I bought the Chromebook to use when traveling extensively in the US and Canada, so I need wi-fi on the device at all times. If you buy the Chromebook from Verizon, it comes with the chip installed. So I ended up paying quite a bit more than I was hoping for given the fact that I initially got a good deal on Amazon. It's not recommended that you use your cellular phone as a wi-fi hot spot for the Chromebook. And I don't have a smart phone anyway, so that was not an option for me. Otherwise, so far I love the Chromebook and would buy it again, for sure. Track pad and touch screen are super responsive  and the keyboard is quite nice as well. Screen has great resolution and sound quality is fair.

It does the former better than the latter, but if I'm crunched for weight and space, it does the job.  I import music scores from PDF into Squid (Android app) and I can mark them up with the stylus.  A little unwieldy as a tablet, just because it is so big.  It has no direct connection to HDMI, but I bought an inexpensive USB-C adapter and we are in business.  Same for full-size SD cards.  However, it does have one built-in USB 3.0 connection, so you don't need an adapter for USB sticks.Wi-fi performance appears to be a little weak compared to some other devices I have, but has worked okay.","Samsung Chromebook Plus V2, 2-in-1, 4GB RAM, 32GB eMMC, 13MP Camera, Chrome OS, 12.2"", 16:10 Aspect Ratio, Light Titan (XE520QAB-K01US)",&299,review1.csv
18,18,Dsol303,"November 16, 2021",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the hype. Glitchy and heavy,"I was really excited to try a Chromebook and searched around through many of them before choosing this one. I wanted it for my travels as something smaller that could fit in my purse or bag. Unfortunately during my trip there were many times when I would try to turn it on and it just would not turn on. Or it would be frozen up. And it was brand new. The battery life lasts a long time but what's the point when I can't get it to even turn on or open a program. And although the size was right, or I thought it was, it is actually very heavy for its size. The weight of it in my purse actually made my shoulders hurt where my purse strap was. It's quite hefty. It doesn't seem like it for the first few minutes but as you continue on with it you can really feel its weight. At this size I feel like it's kind of pointless. It's not small enough to easily fit in a purse or small bag, and definitely not light enough. But it's also too small to be a decent laptop for home. Unfortunately by the time I got back from my trip, only having used it a couple times, the return window had closed and so I'm not able to return it. So now I'm stuck with this.

I am currently at a conference in Paris, and Chrome is registering the wifi provided by the univerisity here as being unsecure. Chrome refuses to let me log on, (I even tried the usual workarounds. No go) and since the device does not allow Firefox or IE, it basically is functioning like an oversized paperweight. Toggling between porjects is very painful.

2,2,Alia Rose ,"April 11, 2021",1.0 out of 5 stars,Seemed worth the money but major hidden costs,"Fourth Update:A brief moment of connectivity assured me: ""You're connected to a Ethernet network."" Not just getting norked out of your two hundred smackers and your valuable time. Right? Not just serving to provide a connection to someone who lacks a valid visa, Right? Now's the time to dish the real dirt on the first purchase: it burned my legs, there was some bad circuitry or programming. This device is labeled as made in VietNam but I wouldn't be sure it's even that good. The price is cheap and the build is like from Mattel but this is no toy. Buyer Beware!!!The replacement seemed new enough & didn't burn my legs or fingers but I had to return it. Along with the bargain chromebook came some dedicated representatives of the seller/manufacturer...? Who set up camp across the creek from my cabin & have been diggling with the connections for weeks. Its been a total hassle. Still I wanted to avoid the bother of returning a $200 dollar purchase & tried & tried to make it work but just like the first purchased (killswitched) there has been an administrative kaibosh on internet access at the last day to return the thing. I was one hundred percent connected yet denied internet access (see screenshot) & had to use my older chromebook to set up the return.Updates: (third review)The replacement netbook from Samsung. Could Amazon be the unwitting host of a seller of stolen or even counterfeit goods? More and more programming irregularities keep  showing up. Like the pic I'm posting now: Prompted to use Guest Mode and/or Sign In when I already AM in Guest Mode...Still I really wanted to love the netbook but closer inspection showed more and more signs of excessive factory-programmed presets and physical scuff marks, even dings in the cover that evidenced this was a used chromebook. I would still give it four stars for the moments it did work, at one point my one-bar cell connection ran an hour-long documentary on Prime Video with virtually no interruptions, BUT once I attempted to use the logged-in owner account and install ZOOM and Bitdefender the thing just DIED!!! It won't charge, it won't turn on, NOTHING!!!Thank God I'm within the 30-day return period and bought the Assurion plan, but how disappointing to have to return it, it looks like if this sort of problem continues I might be profiled as a difficult customer.The main reason I selected this 6GB RAM Samsung Chromebook: the USB charging function, and for this I'd give it ten stars if possible.Drawbacks: The hi-speed charger that came with the unit just about overheated & I had to purchase the 45w adapter and a couple C-to-USB adapters separately, but my dream of keeping my off-grid connection charged from my rinkydink solar setup has now come true!Bonus Tips from a Non-techie: I'm not a techie here so I'm just wondering if the compatability between my Samsung phone and chromebook has boosted the connectivity through the use of tethering plus bluetooth. Whether it's the faster processor or whatnot, what took hours to load a 3-minute video before now loads instantly and this has saved me the time and expense of buying a signal booster.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K8G7663/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08QMSZR2C/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1","Samsung Chromebook 4 Chrome OS 11.6"" HD Intel Celeron Processor N4000 6GB RAM 64GB eMMC Gigabit Wi-Fi - XE310XBA-K03US",&279,review10.csv

10,10,Cee Chance,"March 7, 2022",1.0 out of 5 stars,Chromebooks are the worst!,"I bought this laptop for my daughter (9 yrs old) to be her first laptop computer. I was looking for something that was somewhat easy to use and this chromebook popped up on a number of ""best first time laptops for kids"" lists. We've used it maybe a total of 3 times and it was a complete waste of money.First, the chromebook does not have the capabilities my daughter was looking for. This is our fault for not doing a little bit more research before buying (but this was more due to a miscommunication between parent and daughter). Unfortunately, this was a Christmas gift and my husband accidentally burned the box it came in on Christmas morning! So returning it wasn't an option. So we tried to make the best of it!The second issue is that the login and parent control features are too much. Every time my daughter tried to turn on the computer, we had to go through a lengthy process of entering a password, parent access code, password again, and sometimes we were then asked to enter all the parent email account information! It was totally ridiculous! And we even tried to adjust the settings to allow easier login but it seemed very arbitrary when we were or were not required to go through extra security levels to login.I'm not really sure why anyone would want to purchase a chromebook. They are junk. Limited capabilities (might as well buy a tablet) and everything is google dependent (not surprising but comes with too many limitations). I regret trying to buy a more affordable laptop for my kid.","Samsung Chromebook 4 Chrome OS 11.6"" HD Intel Celeron Processor N4000 6GB RAM 64GB eMMC Gigabit Wi-Fi - XE310XBA-K03US",&279,review10.csv

13,13,Cheryl Ann,"March 30, 2022",1.0 out of 5 stars,This Chromebook was 2.5 times more than the one I bought at Walmart and is even worse,"My first recommendation, is never buy a Chromebook. They are just terrible devices. First of all, the screen quality is horrible. You can't watch videos or movies, because it is terrible. You cannot brighten the screen, think of looking at a dingy gray screen that has no contrast. Between the two I bought and my friend's Chromebook, all from different manufacturers, it is clear that all Chromebooks have this problem. They don't have delete keys on the keyboard, and when I hook up an external keyboard, the enter, backspace, and several other keys do not work without pressing down the Shift key. The way your hand rests on the square hand control of the keyboard makes the curser jump around on you and do all sorts of things you don't want. So you cannot really use the device keyboard, you have to install and exterior one to do any real work. The devices are also very slow, which defeats the purpose. 6 GB Ram should be a lot faster. I had two ASUS notebooks a decade ago that were better in every regard. It is hard to navigate, hard to find what you need, really cannot use it for the word docs and other things. I really cannot think of one good thing about this Chromebook. This is NOT a touch screen device either, so know that upfront.","Samsung Chromebook 4 Chrome OS 11.6"" HD Intel Celeron Processor N4000 6GB RAM 64GB eMMC Gigabit Wi-Fi - XE310XBA-K03US",&279,review10.csv

12,12,Johnny_Amazon®,"September 28, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for Students, But Also Great for Adults, Especially for Travel","Since I'm not a student (Chromebooks are usually geared towards students), this review is mainly from a regular adult's point of view. Here is my reasoning for the title of my review - Chromebooks are perfect for travel because:1) Mainly because they are cheap, so in the event that you lose it or break it, you won't regret it so much.2) It is very light, especially for being a 14-inch laptop. At just over three pounds, it's beneficial for your carry-on luggage so you can save more leftover weight for your other essentials.3) The main difference between Chromebooks and regular laptops is that you can't install programs in the traditional sense. You have to use apps or extensions from Chrome. However, in this sense, the bright side is twofold: It allows for your computer to be more safe since you don't install programs onto it, and also it allows your laptop to perform faster since it's more streamlined in its purpose, which is a web-based/cloud-based laptop.4) A big 14-inch screen at this price is awesome. The bezels could have been thinner, especially at the top edge, but overall the screen is a plus considering the price. The battery life is also tremendous - I used it for a total of over six hours of surfing the web, watching movies, checking my emails, and it still had over 30% left. This is much better than my main laptop, which is an OLED 13"" HP Spectre x360.With this particular Chromebook from Samsung, I feel it is especially more faster than other Chromebooks I've used in the past. However, full disclosure, the last time I used a Chromebook was four years ago, so technology surely has since improved. There has been no lag for me so far when I'm using Chrome with a bunch of tabs open, including a few just for Gmail. I have also watched movies on Netflix.com, and it can handle all that running at once.With that out of the way, here are a few niggles that I was disappointed by. First and foremost is the screen, which is decent and expected of cheap laptops at this price range. Nonetheless, it's disappointing since it's Samsung, and I had expected better, since I have and have used so many Samsung products in the past it has made me jaded. It is not very bright, not made for outdoor use, with very limited viewing angles. The screen being at 14 inches was definitely a plus. especially since the whole la[top weighs just over three pounds, but I just wish it was better quality. And finally, the specs on this is a measly 4gb of RAM and only 32gb of flash memory drive. It would have been nice if they had an upgrade option of a better screen and specs for like $100 more.Taking everything into consideration, I still enthusiastically recommend this laptop. It's something you can buy just for a trip, and then back at home have as a secondary laptop that you rarely would use, and it would still not be a wasted buy. That's because with the overall package of everything put together, it's a great value: Big screen, great battery life, super lightweight, snappy performance, all at a great price of under $300.","Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Go Laptop Computer Lightweight Slim Durable Design 12-Hour Battery Wi-Fi 6 Share Files with Phone, Black,Silver,32GB",&289,review11.csv

However, AT&T continues to sell them, knowing there are problems with the Chromebook.For what I've contracted to pay, I am not getting my monies worth, nor can I use the Chromebook on anything other than WiFi, which was not my intention when I got it.For those who may look at this review, All info regarding the failure and known failure is available online from various sites via Google.By beware, but, if you are only going to use it with WiFi, then you might be OK.","Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Go Laptop Computer Lightweight Slim Durable Design 12-Hour Battery Wi-Fi 6 Share Files with Phone, Black,Silver,32GB",&289,review11.csv

If you must have a nice display, look elsewhere. The screen in this one is not IPS, and the viewing angles are limited, the resolution is only 1366x768.That said, everything else is good. It's quick, runs smooth, power through everything I threw at it. It streams 4K/60 content from YouTube without dropping frames. (you'll want an external display to appreciate it though!) Benchmarks are better than I expected given it's specs. Results were better than 70% of all users that ran the same benchmark, and 80% better then those using ChromeOS. I used it all day, then into the next and still had over 50% battery left, which it estimated to be nearly 8 more hours of runtime. I think the spec'd 12hr battery life is very realistic. Samsung did a good job tuning this one to get all it's potential, efficiently. Even stressing it like this it doesn't get hot, just barely warm. There's no fans or anything for cooling, so it remains totally silent.The keys feel good, though spacing is a little weird for me. I'll get used to it over time, I guess the same can be said for any new keyboard. The touch pad works well and is responsive. I like that it has a hardware button for clicking, or a tap will also work. It supports the usual gestures and all feels natural.Sound quality is surprisingly good. It's clear and loud with good lows, mids, and highs. The two speakers are down firing mounted in the bottom, and will get a bit muffled when using on a soft surface.The camera is just OK, not great by any means. It will do for Skype and the like, but that's about it.","Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Go Laptop Computer Lightweight Slim Durable Design 12-Hour Battery Wi-Fi 6 Share Files with Phone, Black,Silver,32GB",&289,review11.csv
15,15,TM,"August 17, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Samsung Quality With Google Hype,"I generally don’t like Chromebooks. They are under-powered and for what they are overpriced. Mainly since so many students had to work from home, and demand for these spiked almost overnight.They started with the noble idea to be an affordable alternative to regular spec notebooks, got more expensive over the years, to the point of a price-bubble that pushed even older models into $500 territory. And still most think of them as an affordable option to ‘real’ computers.The reason why these are so omnipresent is because Google talked school districts into the idea that they are safe to use and easy to administrate. And while there are some really nice rugged models that are built to resist even the above average careless student abuse, many are just cheaply made low-spec laptops. Often using a privately used computer with a different operating system (Lubuntu on an older notebook works great) would do, but some school apps ask for some deep gripping admin rights on the computer. Something I personally don’t want to allow on a device for personal use.But here we are, the new school year begins and many of us parents would rather buy a Chromebook than use a dated one issued by the school. It's either sign up for a ridiculous expensive device insurance or sign to pay in case of damage.  Our school district wants $350 to replace an over ten year old Lenovo in case of a total loss!So putting down the money for this Samsung actually makes sense. Especially since it’s reasonably priced. There isn’t too much to say about the specs. It’s there where it should be, and it works. Samsung is a good brand with a wide variety of products. From all the Samsung products we own and owned, they have been very reliable. I still have a 2014 Galaxy S10 that still keeps going after I handed it down to my daughter.The display is crisp and sharp, the battery life is good for a few hours off the plug, and the quality and feel is great and above average in this price segment. The fact that it looks like metal, but isn’t makes it IMO feel a bit cheaper when touching it. That’s a brain trick and wouldn’t be an issue at all with a solid colored case.The design is inline with the wedge-trend. I wish it would be more functional like older Dells, with the rubber edge and water resistant keyboard, but there are other good options to protect the device from hits and drops. This also means the keyboard is flat with very short travel, meaning the tactile feedback is flat rather than a press like on a traditional full size keyboard.I like that it still comes with a traditional USB-A (the big square) port aside the modern USB-C (small roundish) ports. That means it’s still able to handle older cables, thumb drives, etc. while USB-C gets rid of clunky proprietary power adapters. Also headphone jack!For myself as a parent I can only say: It sucks that options are so limited when it comes down to choosing devices, especially since I would prefer not to have Google peeking into my kids' school career, but for what it is, this is a good choice for a Chromebook; Especially for teens and older who prefer to have their own devices and some style along with it.  So that’s five stars for the product, but with the call to all parents to always ask if there are options to using Chrome OS and if not, why?I hope this helps to make a decision.","Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Go Laptop Computer Lightweight Slim Durable Design 12-Hour Battery Wi-Fi 6 Share Files with Phone, Black,Silver,32GB",&289,review11.csv
16,16,Bruce and Kathy O'Gorman,"September 19, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,"You know what, I love it!  As a windows laptop user, I was hesitant to make the jump to a Chromebook.  I was fearful the user experience would be tough to adapt to, and I'd end up chucking it in the drawer of other devices I lost interest in using.  I stand corrected!  I love this little laptop, here is what I've noticedPros:1. Battery life is GREAT, I get almost an entire day of surfing and light office work.  Far more than any other  windows based laptop I've used.2. Charging is fast as well.  I can get this thing topped off and ready to keep going while sipping some coffee in the coffee shop doing work.  Before I head out, it's fully charged and ready to go.3. Screen size is great, just big enough to make it easy to see and use, but small enough to keep it compact and easy to transport.  It's also THIN, in a good way.4. very lightweight.6. The keyboard feels great with excellent feedback and spacing.  The center mouse is small enough my wrists don't brush it by accident when typing.7.  Chrome apps work great and there is a lot of integration and cross-function between them.8. Price, it's a great little web server and light-duty word processing and email computer.Cons:1. It may not be Google's fault, but it does not play well with competing apps like Firefox browsers.  Don't expect to find apps with heavy processing needs, no Photoshops etc.  Everything in the Chrome Store is a ""lite version"" but still gets it done.2.  Gestures will take some getting used to.  Instead of a right-click, you two-finger press.3. App layout is a bit cumbersome, file management is as well.4.  Camera quality is still meh.  In the days of Zoom, it's sad the camera on laptops still looks like it's from an old early 2000s flip-phone.  Surely they have better camera tech from their phones they can stick in these things.Overall, a Chromebook makes a great on-the-go tool for anything you'd expect to be able to do on your phone, but with a real keyboard and large screen, and exceptional battery life.

17,17,Knowlengr,"August 19, 2021",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Get it for MIL STD testing, Battery Life and Wi-Fi 6","You can get a lot for 300.00 US today.  For amusement, look at mini-PC's, which need external keyboard, mouse and display, but come with desktop-like capabilities and are expandable for more memory.  Sure, they're not laptops, but the core machine is portable, in fact more so than a laptop, so long as your destination has the requisite keyboard, mouse and display.I disgress.For 300.00 US in this instance, you get a long battery life and good Wi-Fi 6, which could be essential for on-the-road journalism, student notes or remote lab projects.If you're an Android user, you get many settings and preferences moved automatically when you set it.  Contrast that with Windows laptops, where more steps are needed to install the apps you need. (Partly this is because Microsoft abandoned their mobile platform.)Samsung made some compromises here, but sometimes you want bare bones.  The machine might be used only occasionally, for children, or may need to be dedicated to a particular purpose, or is needed for public use and will get beat up. Finesse, higher cost, weight and power give you more features, but they are not always needed.I'd like to comment on the ""military grade"" aspect that is claimed, but I didn't see a way to test MILSTD 810G findings.  Let's just say that this is a definite plus for many environments.PRO- Like most current Chromebooks, can use many different USB-C chargers, so long as they have enough wattage for this Galaxy book- Fast setup for Android phone users (as with all Chromebooks)- Good price point- Wi-Fi 6 will be noticeably faster for some users- Battery life is good (12 hrs may be a stretch though, depending on what tasks you throw at it)- 3 USB ports enables external mouse, keyboard, camera/mic (some laptops have fewer ports on their low end offeringts)- MILSTD 810G testingCON- Memory is limited- Screen isn't great at this below-HD resolution but it's fine for most tasks- It's very light, but at 14"", I wish it were closer to 11 or 12 for still better portability. Samsung makes smaller ones but not with these other features- You will miss having a touch screen as you come off your Samsung Galaxy phone- It's ChromeOS which won't have some apps for some users.","Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Go Laptop Computer Lightweight Slim Durable Design 12-Hour Battery Wi-Fi 6 Share Files with Phone, Black,Silver,32GB",&289,review11.csv
18,18,N. Krumpe,"August 12, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Disappointing display, but reasonable for the price","The low-resolution display and washed out colors are the first things I noticed about this Chromebook. All in all, the display is just kind of disappointing. I know: It's a low-cost Chromebook, and so I should adjust my expectations appropriately. But still, it's hard not for me to get disratcted by the display.Also, I got the model with 32GB of storage. However, 13 of those 32 are used for the system, bringing the available storage down to 19GB. And then, I installed Linux, and the installer recommended that I set aside 10GB for Linux storage. So, now I'm down to 9GB of Chromebook storage. Of course, given that this is a Chromebook, one would not expect as much storage as one would finde on a Windows or Mac machine.Are you using this primarily for editing Google docs and watching YouTube videos? If so, you don't need much storage space (because documents are generally stored in the cloud), and the screen resolution is acceptable. But if you want a Chromebook with decent specs, including a sharp image and plenty of storage, this most definitely is NOT the Chromebook you should be considering alternatives.","Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Go Laptop Computer Lightweight Slim Durable Design 12-Hour Battery Wi-Fi 6 Share Files with Phone, Black,Silver,32GB",&289,review11.csv

I used this mostly for word processing type work with cloud based storage and was impressed! It’s zippy and convenient with the built in Wifi 6.The one feature that is lacking is the display. The resolution is just fine for simple programs, but not super great for any video work. If you are planning on editing videos or photos I don’t think this display will do you any favors. The outer shell is plastic even though it looks metallic in photos, and honestly makes it feel more portable than an expensive MacBook.

Aesthetically, it looks good with a familiar wedge shape in silver plastic with a black interior. It feels sturdy and rigid. The keyboard is nicely laid out and has good key action for typing. The trackpad is a decent size and tracks smoothly. The Chromebook charges via USB-C - wall charger and USB-C cable is included. There are two USB-C connectors, USB-A, headphone jack and microSD card slot. Battery life is quite good - I was able to go for an extended editing session for a few hours and still had plenty of battery left. It comes with 32 GB of storage which is sufficient for editing documents, spreadsheets, surfing the web or other lightweight tasks since most content is stored in the cloud. Performance is fine - it feels responsive and never left me waiting. Playback of 1080p streaming video is smooth. The one area of needed improvement is the display. Viewing angles are restricted and colors are not as saturated as they could be - but adjusted at the right angle it’s OK in use. On the other hand, the sound is good - nice midrange and high end, with a bit of bass.

The end of life for the  samsung chromebook 3 is this year in June. I've been looking for an affordable chromebook similar to what I have now and has the farthest end of life date so far for price.The Samsung chromebook go is just that.

It's a way wider screen and even though I see many reviews on how bad the screen is, the chromebook 3 from the same maker is the same quality as well, but this chromebook go looks good to me. It's sleek trying to pose as a MacBook. It's light and has a USB C charging cable that's perfect for my Samsung s21 phone as well. I also play games on it with my Amazon Luna account and it's faster than my phone, old chromebook, Kindle, and fire stick when playing games.I've had PC laptops that were at the 500 price range and they could install programs, but starting it up would take 10 minutes and it was slow loading anything.

1,1,Josh,"April 7, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Basic device for basic tasks,"I'm split on this device. On one hand it doesn't have a great screen, it's memory and storage limited, the processor isn't very powerful, and it only has a single standard USB port. On the other hand it is compact, has decent battery life, an alright build quality for a cheap device, has an SD card slot, and does an passable job when it comes to writing, spreadsheets, surfing the web, watching videos, and even light gaming.Chrome OS, on the other hand, seems to struggle with most things. It lacks some of the basic functionality you expect of a modern OS and can be anti-intuitive to use.  It has stability issues with apps, especially ones that compete with Google's own (such as Firefox).Thankfully you can install a basic Linux build for things like Libre Office, but many programs installed that way also seem to have stability issues (like VLC Media Player).The built in media player works but has a terrible interface and limited control, and only the terrible mobile versions of other media players seem to work right. The device has speakers, but they aren't very loud and seem crackly -- thankfully a headphone jack is included.It has no touchscreen and the trackpad is possibly the worst I've ever used, to the point of being frustrating and/or not working the way I want it to -- partly because of the OS, itself, and partly because it doesn't have any buttons or anything available to assist its functionality. A mouse is necessary for comfortable use.The keyboard is alright, comfortable to type on.Honestly, though, if I had the choice to go back and purchase something else I probably would. I'm not sure Google's operating system is for me -- you can't even use the desktop to place shortcuts or folders! I would just get a regular laptop and install Linux Mint on it. Doing so would result in an experience that is far more intuitive, stable, and with the benefit of having access to the functionality of a full fledged OS (and all the programs available for it).At the same time, this will do for most the things I bought it for, just less than expected in some respects.Buy if you want something super basic to write on, look stuff up on, and to keep records.

You will need to use another device (smart phone or Windows device) to get the information that explains how to do so, and it is complicated.  Buying a Chromebook is  for the purpose of simplicity and you won't be able to configure your Chromebook until you get past that hurdle.  The other con is that you cannot download the latest version of the Alexa app because it is not compatible with this unit.  If your purpose is to control/configure your smart home or other Alexa connected devices, you can't do it with this particular Chromebook.  If you want to get a Windows based laptop in the same price range, it will be in ""S"" mode, which is great; however, you will need to turn off ""S"" mode to get anything from an app store that is NOT Microsoft and can only use the Edge browser, again, by turning off S mode.

The second one being, whenever I want to write an email, I can't press ""tab"" to indent anymore.  In fact, it seems like I can't do it in any box that I can put text in, such as the box for this review. The third thing, being that you can NOT right click without pressing the ""alt"" tab.

While I understand this isn't necessarily a laptop and that features guaranteed to be different, all four of these issues combined has caused enough irritation for me to write this review. Don't get me wrong, this laptop is great for school. The web camera is wonderful, I don't have any connection issues, but these weird perks are very annoying. Had I known that the chromebooks were designed like that, it would have eased my frustrations getting use to this, or I would have considered getting something else.","SAMSUNG Galaxy Chromebook 4 11.6-inch 64GB eMMC, 4GB RAM, Gigabit Wi-Fi, Chrome OS, HD Intel Celeron Processor N4000",&233,review2.csv
18,18,Amazon Customer,"July 27, 2020",4.0 out of 5 stars,Product good - service not so much,"This is my first Chromebook. I did alot of inquiring and research prior to purchasing. When it arrived, therse was an issue with getting signed on. After trying myself for a couple of days, I decided to call support. I am pretty sure the gentleman I spoke with has never seen a Chromebook. He had to stop and look up every possible issue and even argued with me at times. One for instance, he told me to find the 2 buttons on the scroll and click the right one. THERE ARE NOT TWO buttons. It is one smooth pad like most laptops have. After an hour of speaking with him, I was getting quite irritated. He finally decided I had to mail it in for service. They sent me a shipping label with an incorrect name and mailing address. I then had to contact them again. The ""supervisor"" stated she would send a corrected label. This NEVER came. Eventually my son came for visit from 2000 miles away and had it fixed in less than 15 minutes. SAMSUNG: PLEASE get some people in your tech support that have a clue.Once signed on, this is a great little machine. I read so many negatives about the poor quality of the screen and I DO NOT see a problem. It is clear and bright.

0,0,Tyler Ward,"June 4, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Slim Sleek Beautiful Power Hungry Beast,"A good place to start would be that I got this chromebook at a discount ($749, down from $999). And my needs are mainly to run Citrix (through browser or Chrome app, either works) for work and to casually browse, read magazines/books or listen to Spotify.  Not a ""Power User"" by any means, though not sure any Chrome OS user is.That being said, this is THE BEST CHROMEBOOK I'VE EVER USED, and it is more than perfect to suit my needs.Build: The thing is beautiful, a really premium feel to the materials, and the red is really classy and not too gaudy as I was a bit worried and almost went with the more drab grey option - I'm glad I didn't. The chrome ring around the outside is also a premium touch that looks great. It's the thinnest and lightest 2-in-1 laptop I've ever seen, and I know that I like to use 2-in-1s in tablet mode and this is the first time it actually feels comfortable and feasible to do that for more than a brief period of time. The 2.2lbs was a big draw for me when comparing this laptop to the Galaxy Chromebook 2, Asus C436, or the Acer Spin 713 - upon using it I am glad I took it into consideration. Other great things about the build are the relatively loud stereo speakers and the built-in stylus. Minor drawbacks would be the weak hinge that doesn't always hold the screen in place when moving the laptop if open (though for the most part it does the job) and the lack of ports (you just get 2 USB-C ports, which also function as charging ports, so if you're charging you only have 1...adapters easily solve this). Also the cameras are weak but I don't use those - if you're buying for camera quality only for some reason (Zoom?) then this isn't the one for you.Screen: The SCREEN is AMAZING. The OLED is top notch and better than any Chromebook I've ever seen, at full brightness the colors are insane. That being said, the high resolution and the brightness eat at the battery life a lot, so in most cases I've got brightness scaled way down and I don't really miss anything, it works fine. Touch works perfectly, the stylus allows for really detailed notes/drawings in Canva or other apps. One drawback might be the bezel placement, there are 3 super-thin outer bezels and one larger bottom bezel... in tablet mode that one larger bezel functions well as a ""handle"" of sorts, but the other sides can't be touched without accidentally hitting the screen and scrolling or clicking a link, etc. A very minor nuisance at most. Another minor issue is that the resolution is SO GOOD that when I run Citrix, the session almost appears blurry, but still workable - on high resolution windows machines Citrix has addressed this with DPI scaling, but they've yet to master this on the Chrome OS app or the Chrome web app. Not Samsung's issue, but still part of my experience with the machine so I thought it worth mentioning.Performance: This thing is a BEAST. There's arguably no need for an Intel i5 in a Chromebook, but here we are, and the thing is FAST. Scrolling is smooth and even with tons of tabs open I've never experienced lag when playing videos or games. With lots going on under the hood, and no fan, I've heard mention from others that the computer can get really hot under heavy loads - I've barely experienced this while using a decent amount of processing power, and would elaborate that when I did feel heat it was very minor and not unbearable by any means. I'm thinking unless you are gaming a lot or developing in linux or doing something really really processor heavy, you'll be fine. A small performance gripe in general is that Android apps don't always play well with Chrome OS and have re-sizing issues or some lag, but this is not a Samsung problem, more of a Google problem.Battery Life: Some people have called this the achilles heel of the laptop, but I don't have much issue. Again, I'm not a real gamer/developer/super user - I am Joe Basic using it for administrative work and browsing/music/reading. On an average day at like 70% brightness I can unplug at 8am and make it to about 3 or 4pm before having to plug back in while working in Citrix doing basic tasks on MS Access, Excel, etc - nothing intense but that's pretty much constant screentime for about 6-7 hours before it starts getting low and I've got to plug in. Obviously this is not great in comparison to 10+ hours at full brightness seen on other Chromebooks - but you are getting more than the average Chromebook here and this is a bit of a concession made on Samsung's part to provide the rest of the goods. Overall if you don't need to be away from a charger for more than 6 hours every day, you shouldn't have an issue.Should you buy it: If you have read this far and think your needs/usage are similar to mine and you want the sleek-est, coolest, thinnest chromebook out there, DEFINITELY BUY THIS (especially if on discount, which it frequently is between Amazon, Best Buy, and Samdsung's own site).","SAMSUNG 13.3"" Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, HD Intel Core I-5 Processor, Ultra Slim, US Warranty, Fiesta Red",&1033,review3.csv
1,1,RemixDaMix,"August 8, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful image poor battery.,"Bought this Chromebook because it was decently priced (under $600), didn't have a Celeron, was thin and wanted to try my hand at something that wasn't Windows based.Took a bit of time figuring out how to navigate and am kind of still learning but this laptop is very appealing for what I was wanting to use it for. It's the only Chromebook I know with a 4k resolution screen, not that I was wanting it for that, but the image quality looks stunning. The i-5 processor is fast enough to handle most any daily functions and the thin stylings of the laptop itself is very appealing. It comes with a stylus that's installed directly into the machine and works flawlessly. Audio isn't anything to brag about but does get plenty loud for most entertainment options. I normally use it to watch a sports game while playing board games with friends or watching Youtube videos to learn said board games. Convertible mode is exactly what you'd expect but was surprised the laptop doesn't get extremely hot when the screen is folded to block the air vents. Is small and light enough that it doesn't seem so burdensome but large enough that it doesn't feel like I'm typing on something meant for a child.My biggest issue though is the 4k screen. I can watch all forms of resolution on this laptop but have no options to force the resolution to something lower to help save on battery life and boy is the 4k screen a energy hog. My entire view point before buying this was that I knew the battery life wasn't that great but figured I'd just lower the resolution and get whatever I could out of the battery but was disappointed to find out that's impossible. Don't get me wrong the 4k screen is beyond beautiful but now I need to plan accordingly if I'll be out and about with this Chromebook, something I didn't really expect when purchasing the product.All in all I'm happy with this product and as long as the battery life isn't a complete deal breaker then I highly recommend.","SAMSUNG 13.3"" Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, HD Intel Core I-5 Processor, Ultra Slim, US Warranty, Fiesta Red",&1033,review3.csv
2,2,Kindle Customer,"July 26, 2021",3.0 out of 5 stars,"The best resolution screen of any computer, but otherwise there are many issues.","If I needed a computer merely for streaming content and wanted the best quality and highest resolution, then this is the clear leader and without exception the best offered in the market.  If you need it to do other things it is best to look at something else.Despite the short battery life (around 4 hours of continuous use video streaming of Amazon prime HD offerings), I was willing to accept that, but constant and continuous other issues resulted in making me nuts.  So what are the issues?1. It gets hot and I don't mean warm, I mean hot enough to redden the skin if you are holding it on your lap.  Everytime it got that hot which happens after using it for over a hour or so, I would elevate it on a rack I use for cooling cookies when they come out of the oven.  This allowed air to constantly be under the laptop.  Did it help?  No.  If you are intending to use this for several hours straight, you need to invest in a base which has a fan blowing cool air onto the bottom.  This means the portabiity just went out the window.2. Touchscreen fails to respond.  It is maddening to be in the middle of a project only to have your touch screen stop responding to touch, provided epen, touch pad or cursor with a mouse.  It was necessary to close everything down and restart the computer to fix it.3.  Keyboard touches opens random programs.  This one was really puzzling.  I would be typing and all of a sudden an program would open.  I assumed I must have inadvertently touched something on the keyboard while typing, but have no clue as to what it was.  Since I didn't know what caused it, I was unable to avoid doing it.4. Weird keyboards show up on touch screen and you cant get them to close.  I know there are times when you are using this in tablet mode that you want the keyboard to be on the screen.  However why one would appear when you are typing was yet another mystery.  How to get rid of it was equally puzzling.  To add insult to injury, the keyboard which would show up differed from one time to another.  Occasionally it was the Qwerty type, but frequently it was not.  (One of them had row upon row of yellow circle face icons for heavens sake!)  I would get rid of one only to have another show up.5. Settings change without my input.  You go to settings and have the computer's cursor, screen layout, wallpaper etc all set up to your own personal preferences.  Then without any rhyme or reason they are changed.  Yes it is easy to go back and set them again, but I shouldn't have to do this and it is a pain in the butt to keep reconfiguring they physical look of the display.6. Bluetooth devices don't always stay paired.  Once you have scanned and selected a blue tooth device, I am used to it always being on the list of available devices which you can then click to quickly reconnect.  Here on a few occasions I had to go back to the repairing process to get them to connect.  Again another time waster.There were othe6 I knew about before I purchased such as there only being a couple C type outlets.  I had this issue with another Samsung product so had already purchased the doogle (dongle?) so that I could plug in my memory cards, usb and micro USB cords.Other positives are the look. This had to be the best looking laptop I have ever seen.  Only the blue Samsung Galaxy laptop for windows looks as good. The built in epin when working was fabulous.  You could set it up to magnify the screen, take a screenshot, etc so it allowed versatility not often seen in similar chromebooks.  It is fast.  Everything moved so quickly, and the processing was better than any other chromebook I have used to date.I know the new Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 has worked to solve some of these issues.  Unfortunately that has been done at the expense of factors which made the thing so great to start out with.  In short if these are ever just a few hundred dollars I will get one for video streaming as I do a lot of it.  But for over 600.?

Also speakers are kind of meh.....,"Had to go through 3 devices to finally get one that was properly built, as Samsung's quality control is really hit or miss, especially for this device for some reason, so you're basically playing the lottery. Luckily, Amazon's customer service is one of the best in the industry so I was able to get one that functioned properly and was assembled correctly. As far as how it performs, you won't be disappointed, I view this as more of a leisure device opposed to productivity, so far that use case it really is a treat. The screen is gorgeous, blacks are actually black, contrast is through the roof, and colors are so vibrant and full of life that you'll struggle going back to regular screens. The build quality(when you get a good unit) is great, very premium and sturdy, while still being very lightweight. It feels really nice in the hands, and it has the benefit of being just as nice to use as it is to look at. Seriously this is one of the most beautiful computers out there, not just for a chromebook, the metallic cherry red just pops and the silver chrome edges are such a nice touch, it really is a shame that Samsung doesn't offer this color scheme in any other device, I'd love to see it on a windows laptop for example, and like won't ever. All in all, this is a rather expensive chromebook, you're definitely paying a premium for this device, but if you're looking for a great screen, beautiful design, in a premium lightweight chassis, that functions as a tablet replacement of sorts, then this is the chromebook for you.","SAMSUNG 13.3"" Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, HD Intel Core I-5 Processor, Ultra Slim, US Warranty, Fiesta Red",&1033,review3.csv

Samsung seems caught off guard with the battery life being only 4 hours with very consrvitive power usage.I have been looking around for an improved battery to replace the one that came inside my Samsun Galaxy Chromebook but doesn't seem to be anything new out there.  Unfortunately I have a laptop that can only be used around 4 hours on battery.This said I have been watching videos on Youtube where owners claim they get 6-8 hours of battery with brightness to 80+ percent, do i have a  bad battery or they happen to have a better release?Everything else about this Chromebook seems fine, however, my 8gb isn't that as I look to see the ram it uses 7.65Gb, this is Chromebook thing because traditionally you would have much more available for programs you have yet to opena nd run?  Less than 1 Gb available for whatever lolFinding programs in the app store that is full screen or landscape is difficult and have found some that do do not run well at all... the Galaxy Chromebook is concidered a very powerful machine, but seems to struggle at almost anything I load into it except games.  I did load a simple game but failed to keep running and crashes constantly.Perhaps I am asking too much from this Chromebook, I do not do much, mostly edit my website, write small blogs, spreadsheets, email and videos on YT and movies I've purchased.  That pretty much it!I don't recommend this model.Before all of this, I tried to order the original Pixelbook but Amazon accidentally sent me a high end Pixelbook Go (Not PInk), and being the honest person I am returned it and then ended up ordering the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook instead.","SAMSUNG 13.3"" Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, HD Intel Core I-5 Processor, Ultra Slim, US Warranty, Fiesta Red",&1033,review3.csv
7,7,Glenn Brensinger,"December 1, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great device!,"This thing is so cool! Usually I try to go with the latest and greatest if I can justify the cost, but the reviews of this year’s Chromebook 2 vs last year’s Chromebook helped me make the decision to go with last year’s model. Better screen, fingerprint reader, and the fact that instead of $999 it cost less than $600 (plus some credit I already had with Amazon, so I paid less than $300 for it.) It’s starting to compete with my iPad Pro as my daily driver, since most of what I do is web based anyway.The only issue I have is with the touch screen. When I flip the screen to put it in tablet mode, the touch screen stops working until I restart it. The problem is I can’t tell if it’s a hardware problem / defective unit, or if there is an issue with the latest release of ChromeOS. Unfortunately I have asked the question in three places and have not received a response. I am hoping it’s just a glitch with the Chrome OS, because I really like this thing. I even have Crossover running Windows apps and have had no issues with lagging. It’s not getting warm at all (there is no cooling fan.) Did I mention you can run Linux apps on a Chromebook now too? I wasn’t sure about the Fiesta Red, at first I thought it would be too loud, but I’m glad I did it. Shiny and cool looking.Update to my review - the touch screen problem was fixed by Powerwashing it.","SAMSUNG 13.3"" Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, HD Intel Core I-5 Processor, Ultra Slim, US Warranty, Fiesta Red",&1033,review3.csv

But also because ...It's super thin, super lightweight. Yet it feels sturdy and well built. It's hard to spot any piece of plastic on this notebook.The orange-red color is just beautiful. It's not anything near a sharp or aggressive orange. It's a super warm, slightly metallic color. Truly particular. It sits beautifully on wooden desks as well as on any more office-like desk surface. The color tone changes slightly with the light.It has an exchangeable SSD. Not an (slower) eMMC, and neither is it a non-replaceable chip. Whoever had to trash an entire notebook just because the SSD or eMMC failed, knows that having this unit replaceable matters. Also financially.The keyboard feels great. What a masterpiece of engineering. I mean, the whole lower part of the notebook is barely 6mm thick.Not to talk about the display. It probably outperforms most others on the market (and particularly at this price point).What they talk about in reviews, negatively:- short battery life. Indeed. 4-6hrs. That's few. But if they'd asked me to increase battery life and weight and size or leave it at it is, I'd opted for as it is. I just don't need more than 4-6 hrs of battery life; there's always a plug somewhere.- shaking display: true – when used on the lap while sitting on the sofa. When the notebook sits on a stable surface, like a desk, the hinges hold the display in place and it won't shake.What they don't talk about and what I personally find is a shortcoming:- the quality of sound from the internal speakers is low and I cannot enjoy it for all the video conferences we are having nowadays.Some people ask, why someone would need such a powerful chromebook. Because google understood the cloud, because there's no need for servicing, updating, IT people for your (small) business company. Because it's productivity focused. And because, yes, I literally have about 100 tabs open all the time, on different virtual screens, and sometimes even two accounts logged in, and it is still fast.","SAMSUNG 13.3"" Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, HD Intel Core I-5 Processor, Ultra Slim, US Warranty, Fiesta Red",&1033,review3.csv

12,12,Mohammad Ashori,"August 12, 2021",3.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing but beautiful,"The laptop is pretty to look at and it's thin. The screen is a really nice quality but doesn't outshine a MacBook but maybe a little better than the pixelbool. When you use it as a tablet it doesn't close fully so it's floppy and you can't really hold it because the bezels are so small you're always touching the screen. A common issue many have reported is the touchpad which jumps all over but that's a software issue with other apps which are incompatible. I deleted a bunch and it worked but dunno which was the culprit.If you are buying this because you hope to use other Samsung devices with this seamlessly, well, my galaxy buds don't always pair with this and there is no interface which I was surprised by. In fact you can't use the apps for galaxy devices with this Chromebook.It doesn't recognize my Samsung phone even which my Google pixelbook does a slightly better job at. The fingerprint scanner works maybe 50 percent of the time because it doesn't pick up my fingerprints well. Battery life isn't great but it hasn't been too bad for me. It's fast and rarely have I seen it glitch. I would have returned it for sure if I was still in the US but I bought it and left the country. I bought it to replace my pixelbook wthoch I've beat up a lot but even in it's poor state I use the pixelbook 90 percent of the time.I wanted to add to this review - it's really hard to use this laptop because when you turn it into a tablet it doesn't close all the way so you're holding something a little floppy. And the edges of the screen are so small that you're constantly activating something with your finger pads. Ironically, as sensitive as these edges are when you click on something on the screen it doesn't really register the finger well and you have to press a little hard.I'm comparing this to my Chromebook Pixel and it lacks a lot.Update March 2022.The screen quality isn't that high to explain why the battery runs out so fast. The screen not closing all the way against the case in tablet mode remains a big problem in terms of usability.I can't manage to keep the pads of my hand to activate the screen when maneuvering this laptop.

This is both annoying and concerning.* The keyboard is technically backlit, but the light is so dim that it barely helps even when it's dark.* The trackpad is easily pushed down to click near its bottom, but gets increasingly difficult as you go up, which just feels really weird and inconsistent. More than 1/2 of the way up, it's too hard to press for me to practically want to.Despite all the flaws, I love this machine. It's super light. I like the feel of the construction. I like the color. I really like having the browser back/forward/refresh on the keyboard. The stylus, working with Android art programs I already knew and loved, has been a delight. It's really nice to be able to go right from typing an article to drawing illustrations for it on the same device. Being able to run android apps natively on a 2-in-1 is really cool (even though realistically I'd often be better off using the desktop versions of apps on a mac or windows machine -- for example, Slack and Discord do not provide a great experience running their android app in chromos, compared with the experience of their desktop applications on mac.

Most Android apps I've installed are responsive which helps to avoid going fullscreen/forced to use the touchscreen in portrait.Connecting a Dualshock4 controller was effortless, didn't need to configure for Among Us either. Some games like Shadowfall will need some effort to work. No CoD Mobile support was a bummer, hopefully in an update.Complaints: The screen looks great, however no 4k support on most streaming options AND due to the OLED this screen is very dim by default. If you have it at 50% your eyes will be strained after an hour. 70% is comfortable, getting 4 hours average.If you're looking to continue your Android experience in laptop form, this is the way.","SAMSUNG 13.3"" Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, HD Intel Core I-5 Processor, Ultra Slim, US Warranty, Fiesta Red",&1033,review3.csv

Yes it is short you only get 4-6 hours or so with full brightness. After a couple weeks you get in the habit of charging it when your not using it. Once you get used to keeping it charged it lasts all night or all day no problem. The best laptop I have had personally. Screen has great quality, the color is amazing, loads extremely fast and does very well with having multiple tabs open at once. A solid 9.5 out of 10 for me. 1 con I found is overtime the mousepad is easily subject to damage if not cared for properly.

Not all google play apps run smoothly some crash and it is almost impossible to run them. Google needs to work with the developers to make Chromebook specific apps, otherwise this is going to be trouble. I love that it has more than one thunderbolt connection. I have a ethernet to thunderbolt adapter and the internet goes twice as fast vs wifi and I have a premium mesh system, so this is great, because I am not a fan of wifi.

The beautiful red solid aluminum body and stunning AMOLED touch-screen are the stars of this show.  Unfortunately, there's an unfortunate detraction in the form of the trackpad sometimes freezing up and I believe it's due to the machine running too hot.  Shutting the machine down and letting it cool down fixes the issue.  A more practical workaround is using a cooling pad or pairing a mouse to keep working when the trackpad isn't.  For my use case, I can live with the issue as I really enjoy viewing photographs or videos on such an amazing display but your mileage will vary.","SAMSUNG 13.3"" Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM, 4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, HD Intel Core I-5 Processor, Ultra Slim, US Warranty, Fiesta Red",&1033,review3.csv

When I am switching between apps swiping up seems to take a few attempts at least. Battery life is horrible! I get about 2 hours out of a full charge, sometimes 2 1/2 hours but never more. Other reviews mentioned the heat factor and that is correct. I decided to take the chance because the heat issue seemed to have mixed opinions but after using this for a little over a month,  the heat transferred from bottom is an issue. It gets VERY hot. No, it hasn't left burn marks on my skin but it gets hot enough to be very uncomfortable. Because of battery life and the heat issue I don't use it much unless I can set it on a small side table or sofa table which is about the same as having to sit at my desk and use my desktop PC.

3,3,kelly giottonini,"February 9, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excceptional, Practical, and Efficient Product. Impressive in all aspects-- thorough review",". Over the past year or two I came to realize that not only Chromebooks do almost everything a laptop or a PC or a tablet would do for me but they do it cheaper, usually faster and better, almost always worry-free and very much in style. I wrote 'almost' because, yes, not everything does everything even though the Chromebooks seem to be doing a lot and they are getting better - even run Microsoft Office these days (see note at the bottom).WHY A CHROMEBOOK AT ALL?There's so much to say here but let me make a quick summary. And never forget that we are talking about an 'around 300 dollars' device here because, yes, anything that costs 3-4-5 times as much should do SOMETHING better or very few of us would pay more for such devices.˕ My Chromebook is by far my most used computer excluding work hours and by 'computer' I mean PCs, laptops and tablets.˕ Malware, spyware, adware-free. Since nothing is really 'installed' on a Chromebook and not much is physically stored on it, it would be very hard for one to be infected. I am in fact now using my Chromebook to open suspicious emails or click on dubious URLs that I don't dare touch from a laptop.˕ Extremely safe OS. I don't know if this is common knowledge but Google is constantly challenging hackers to crack their OS. As far as I know, Chrome OS wasn't cracked yet.˕ Easy to share among any number of users without any concerns of compromising privacy. If you have a Google account, you simply sign in and you are going to be within your own, personal environment.˕ Constantly updated and upgraded. Google updates Chrome OS every few weeks and I found my Chromebooks actually getting better all the time rather than slowly fall into obsolescence.˕ Nearly maintenance free. Whenever I don't use a tablet or even a laptop for a while, they tend to get very busy once I turn them back on, downloading and installing various patches, updates and upgrades. Not the case for Chromebooks. Whatever upgrades may take place don't hit my Chromebook. Whenever I call up an app, I get it in its latest version.˕ The attached keyboard helps a lot. Yes, you can pair a keyboard and even a mouse to a tablet but the Chromebook's keyboard is always there, it negates the need of a stand or even some protecting case.˕ Chrome OS is streamlined and efficiently focused where it matters, on the everyday uses most of us need a 'computer' most of the time.˕ Chrome OS being such a streamlined one, browsing and running apps on a Chromebook is in fact faster than off a PC/laptop/tablet of equivalent specs.˕ Relatively low prince, 11.6"" display and light weight seem to be just about right for something that typically you'd be using to browse the Web while watching TV or take to and from school.WHY NOT A CHROMEBOOK?Yes, Chromebooks can't do everything. Google's productivity suites notwithstanding, Chromebooks are best at media consumption rather than production. Nobody should buy a Chromebook and expect to be able to edit video or do some hard-core gaming. There are other machines and devices for such tasks. My experience is that a Chromebook can't do 'everything'. Tablets are more portable, PCs and laptops are more powerful and versatile but, to me, my Chromebook is the most fun to use and it's likely to stay this way. I am not going to call it my 'second' or 'third' or 'first' computer but, objectively, it's the one I most use outside business hours if what we measure is 'hours'.MY SON's SAMSUNG's CHROMEBOOK 2 vs. MY HP's CHROMEBOOK 11From the start, it was a very familiar feeling. Samsung's is easily recognizable as a Chromebook (see video).This is how they compare:˕ USB-based charging. Yeah... it's proprietary on the Samsung vs. semi-proprietary on the HP. HP's USB-based charging allows the use of most off-the-shelf chargers so there's a lot less to worry. However, off-the-shelf chargers aren't as efficient as the HP-supplied one so, while I give HP's a slight advantage, both HP and Samsung's are better off when charged with the manufacturer-supplied charger.˕ Better quality display. When compared to Samsung's, HP's colors are sharper and brighter and you can view the screen from almost any angle left/right or up/down. This can be seen in the attached video but it's the difference is even sharper to notice with the naked eye.˕ Keyboard. As a touch typist I am comfortable with both but. On a blind test, I wasn't able to distinguish between the two. As the video shows, the size and the layout are very similar and so is the feel.˕ Style - see video. Again, a matter of preference. HP's glossy white is easier to wipe and clean but some may find Samsung's black more elegant. Both HPs and Samsungs come in other colors. They are both Okay as far as I can tell.˕ Ports. There are no USB 3.0 or HDMI ports on the HP's but you do find them on Samsung's. Speaking for myself, I never felt a need to output HDMI off my Chromebook, ever. I am occasionally using USB to plug in a mouse dongle or perhaps a speaker set. Regardless, USB 3.0 is nice to have.˕ Other hardware. Samsung's comes with double the RAM (4GB) and a much faster processor. This is a clear advantage, especially when running demanding apps such as spreadsheets.Overall, I am pleased with both. I am going to keep my relatively old (but oh so pretty) HP because its primary use is 'entertainment' as in Web browsing and playing media but my kid prefers Samsung because, as a college student, he can put the faster processor and the extra memory to good use.RATINGChromebook 2, while generally excellent, loses one star for the somewhat dull display and for breaking through the 300 dollar price barrier.I am not going to compare Samsung's Chromebook with the Pixel or some top of the line laptop. So, let me make a 'duh' statement: this Chromebook is not as good as devices that sell for 3 times or 4 times as much so anyone who doesn't mind paying more should pay more and get one of those. Even though... look at some reasons above for why one my prefer a Chromebook to a laptop or a tablet, regardless of price.Samsung's is at least as good and in some ways better than my now one year old, often used and much trusted HP Chromebook 11, even though I prefer HPs better display. As far as performance, Samsung beats HP when loading pages even though they both appear to be up to the task and they both played Netflix movies flawlessly over Wi-Fi and cast them to the big TV through Chromecast (no need of an HDMI cable for that) - I mention it because I just tried that. Samsung's Chromebook was able to easily and simultaneously play a movie on Netflix, a video on Youtube and a song on Pandora while I was checking my email and running a spreadsheet in the cloud without breaking a sweat. Not bad for such an inexpensive device. By the way, I had to cut that part from the attached video because it was too annoyingly noisy but I will try to redo it and attach it later.Chromebooks are not for everyone and they are not a universal computing device and Samsung's Chromebook 2 is a Chromebook through and through but, if used for what they are meant to be used, they are as good and as revolutionary as tablets._____________________________________________________NOTES:- Prior to ordering this Chromebook, I attended 'orientation' at our kid's college. The session with the IT director helped me decide to order it. I really wasn't sure what was good for him. He already has a rather large Windows 8 laptop but he doesn't want to take it to school because it's too large and heavy among other reasons. I asked the IT person if he was going to be Okay if he used a Chromebook and he said 'yes'. Then I asked the specific 'Microsoft apps' question: ""are there any 'Microsoft apps' that he may need and won't be able to run on his Chromebook?"" The IT person stated that all students are granted free Web access to Microsoft Office and that Chromebooks are fully supported.- Like most Chromebooks, this one too comes with a free 100GB in Google's cloud for two years. I didn't take advantage of that offer and I'm not going to go for this one, simply because I have no use of 'cloud' storage that goes beyond Gmail at this time.- While Chromebooks are immune to viruses and other forms of malware, you are as tracked and 'monetized' while on a Chromebook as you are when browsing from your laptop or tablet or phone. However, there are ways to disrupt and confuse the trackers and my two favorite extensions these days are Disconnect Search (or Disconnect.me) that makes it impossible for Google to log your search activities and DoNotTrackMe which does what the name implies. Worth trying.","Samsung Chromebook 2 11.6 Inch Laptop (Samsung Exynos, 4 GB, 16 GB SSD, Black)",&49,review4.csv

Recently I needed to replace my laptop, but did not feel like plunking down a lot of cash for a new one.  I have a desktop PC with Windows 7 in good condition for running any special software that I may occasionally need, so I figured that if I ran into things the Chromebook could not handle I could always go back to my desktop for that.  As it turns out, I find myself going back to my desktop very rarely.  There are two programs -- an accounting program and an image processing program -- that I need to run on the desktop, and both of these I would prefer to use on the desktop anyway for the larger monitor.  For everything else the Chromebook not only does it, but does it faster and with less hassle.  If I need to send an email, upload some photos, check the news, or make a quick edit to a document, I can complete the task on my Chromebook in the time it would take my PC just to startup and become functional.  It starts up so quickly that I don't even think about it -- it is basically like opening a book.  The OS, from the user's point of view, is completely an afterthought.  You just switch on the machine and start working.  And you don't have to mess with anti-virus or anything like that.  It is such a worry- and hassle-free device that I can't believe they aren't more popular.  For anyone who dislikes doing PC maintenance or finds Windows confusing, this is definitely the system to go for.  When I first read reviews of Chrome, some said that if you wanted to experience Chrome, just maximize the Chrome browser in your PC and that was basically what it was like.  Not true (at least in the current version).  There are a number of apps built into the system (handy stuff like a calculator) and more that you can add on (nearly all for free) from the app store.  There is also a file manager for managing external storage devices as well as files stored in the machine's own solid state drive.  It is all very intuitive and easy to use.  I glanced through the help menus one time just to learn some shortcuts and such, but it was hardly necessary.  Once you get connected to the internet you will be off and running.  The system is also ideal for users who are using cloud-based apps like Google docs, Evernote, etc.  If you are not already using cloud-based apps, using a Chromebook will likely get you hooked on them.  You always have access to your files wherever you are, and you don't have to worry about losing because your computer crashed or something.So clearly I am sold on the OS.  How about the machine?  I was also pleasantly surprised with the quality of the machine, especially for the price.  It is very thin and lightweight, perfect for carrying around.  It is something you can slip into a briefcase or bookbag and hardly know it is in there.  My previous laptops all look massive in comparison.  I have seen some negative comments about the stitched styling of the top -- personally I think the texture looks and feels nice, and the stitching is reasonably subtle and not cheap looking.  It is not brushed aluminum or whatever, but you are not paying for brushed aluminum (nor should you in my opinion).  This is a machine that looks good and simple, and absolutely gets the job done.  The keyboard is pretty solid, although I am used to deeper keys (more like an external keyboard), and I love the simpler layout that the Chrome OS makes possible.  Huge track pad and very responsive.  I am not enough of a techie to comment on the technical specs really, but I would say that 4 gb ram seems like more than enough to be running a lightweight OS like this.  As for speed, as I mentioned above, everything I have done on this is lightning fast, including video streaming (HD) etc.  The monitor is about average -- I have no complaints about it except that I agree with some other reviewers that the viewing angle is not great, but for personal use it works well and I have watched lots of videos on it and done lots of reading at generally think it is a solid monitor for the price.  Speakers are average / typical for a laptop.  I have not clocked the battery runtime but it is off the charts compared to any laptop I have ever owned.  I don't even think about the battery, just charge it in if I happen to be near the power cable (sometimes only every couple of days depending on usage).  If you are used to a Windows PC I am sure it will be better than the runtime you have now.In conclusion, this is the laptop I always wished was possible.  It is inexpensive, requires no maintenance or software, and it does nearly everything you want very quickly.  Even if you are buying it just to use on the go, you will likely find that it quickly becomes your primary machine, even if you do need to go back to your Windows machine from time to time for a special application.","Samsung Chromebook 2 11.6 Inch Laptop (Samsung Exynos, 4 GB, 16 GB SSD, Black)",&49,review4.csv
5,5,Mr. K,"December 11, 2015",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great option for a tablet/laptop with an amazing price,"I’ve been using the Samsung Chromebook 2 for a few days and am ready to give some impressions.  I have been following the development of Chrome OS for a while now.  A year ago I pre-ordered the ASUS Chromebox, realizing it would be a good, cheap way to get to try out the OS, plus would fulfill the need for a second desktop computer (I already had a spare 24 inch monitor sitting around).  The OS was quite usable a year ago, and has seem some growth since that time, with bug fixes and added features such as the ability to download movies from Google Play to watch offline, and support for Microsoft Office documents has been improved.  There is a good selection of apps that will run offline and all your Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides are stored locally as well as on Google Drive.  When online the browser can be set to respond to “OK Google,” just like on Android.  No matter what Chrome OS device you pick, study the Help file in detail so that you understand the OS’s quirks (like how to right click!).I like to buy locally if possible, so I checked out a couple of stores.  Just based on style the Samsung was the clear leader.  Locally the stores had the silver Intel CPU model, and I got to check it out fairly thoroughly and thought it would do what I wanted.  I went home to compare specs and read reviews, and that’s when I learned about the black model with 4GB of RAM and the Exynos processor here on Amazon.  My ASUS performs OK with 2 GB so I figured that a 4GB model would be a good choice, although I wasn’t sure how the ARM processor would affect performance.  Several professional reviews that I read complained that the Exynos was a bit laggy compared with the Intel processors, but they were really pushing it hard in their tests, which is exactly what I would expect a pro reviewer to do.  Based on reviews on Amazon by actual users, I decided the Exynos version would be OK, and I really liked the looks of the black model.I’ve tried to test every possible feature of the Chromebook 2 in the past few days.  No need to comment on the excellent keyboard and trackpad, as that has been well covered.  As far as speed, I think it is OK.  Not the fastest laptop by any means, but is adequate for light computing and document processing.  YouTube videos run just fine, and I have used Chrome Remote Desktop with good results.  Responsiveness for document processing is pretty good, with just an occasional keystroke lag.  Audio both ways seems to be fine on Google Hangouts.  One thing that isn’t addressed on the Samsung web site is the design of the headphone jack.  In fact, it is a four conductor connection that supports both microphone in and stereo audio out, so you can plug in an earbud/mic combo of the type used with mobile phones.  The Chromebook connects with our Chromecast just fine.I don’t have any issue with the screen and, in fact, I'm pretty well pleased with it..  It’s plenty contrasty for me, and you can dial it up to “torch mode” if you want.  A computer is useless if you can’t do I/O, so a good keyboard, trackpad, and screen go a long way toward keeping the user happy in my opinion.  If you keep the screen turned down the battery life goes up.  Speaking of battery life, of course it varies with what you’re doing and screen brightness, but it appears that eight hours is an honest number for average use.  UPDATE: After another week of use I'd say that seven hours of battery life is a good, real-world number.The HDMI connection works just fine, and I’ve tested it both directly to our television receiver and with an HDMI-to-VGA adapter to a projector.  By the way, the HDMI port powered the adapter just fine and didn’t require external power from a USB port.  I bought a Class 10, 32GB Sandisk microSD card from Amazon for about $15 and discovered two things I had not expected: The default download location can be pointed to the SD card, thus saving space on the SSD, and the Sandisk card comes with a full size adapter, so I could put it in the full-size slot on any of my other computers to transfer files if needed, or could actually use it in a camera if I wanted.  By the way, speaking of cameras Polarr appears to be a good, offline-capable app that emulates Lightroom and will process RAW files.One last thing, another reviewer suggested getting the AmazonBasics 11.6-Inch Laptop Sleeve to go with this Chromebook.  I did that and it is a snug but good fit.  You need to stretch it a bit when pulling the zipper over the corners, but it is a nice, padded case for the price.Overall, if I could give fractional stars, I'd rate the Samsung Chromebook 2 with Exynos processor about a 4.6.  It does what it is supposed to quite well and has an interface that is easy to live with.","Samsung Chromebook 2 11.6 Inch Laptop (Samsung Exynos, 4 GB, 16 GB SSD, Black)",&49,review4.csv
6,6,Lon J. Seidman,"June 21, 2014",4.0 out of 5 stars,Everything is excellent except the screen,"Love it! New chromebook user, soon to be college student, and love this samsung. I go to a school where 90% of the kids have macs, but I'm very happy with choosing this chromebook.  I was almost sold on getting a 2nd gen refurbished Macbook pro for around $600, but then chose this chromebook because my buddy told me about how pleased he is with his. Not only is this cheaper (about $380 after getting protection plan, which I would highly recommend because even though the laptop is well put together, it is very thin, light and has a plastic body which I could foresee breaking with a good drop) but I actually prefer this over having a ""real"" laptop. Aside from Aesthetics, which apple is the premium, I don't think it can get much better than this for your average tech using student. The small, compact, and light body is very convenient, and I have nothing to complain about in regards to the keyboard and touch pad which are all up to par. The only things I'd mention about the keyboard is that there is no Caps Lock key and I'm not sure if there is a way around it, but I also haven't really looked into it because it's not a huge concern of mine. Furthermore, the keys aren't lighted but I think this is pretty over rated because the screen provides lighting if you're in the dark.  I got the Black model and, again, nothing to complain about in terms of how it looks. The faux leather top isn't too flashy where it looks tacky, and I'm not overly crazy about it but it is different and looks nice in a subtle way. I wouldn't let this play too big of a factor if your'e thinking about getting this because if you aren't a fan of it I'm sure there are clip on cases to cover it. It's very thin and light which I like, but also doesn't feel overly plastic and cheap, but again it is far from the feel of a macbook body. The speakers are located on the bottom but deliver; I wasn't sure what to expect with the audio but the sound is clear and pretty loud coming from the speakers(louder and nicer than most laptops, mac included)  Now, what I think is most important when thinking about purchasing a laptop--the actual performance. This thing is FAST. My wifi at my house is pretty strong, but with xbox live running, a laptop, a desktop, and a handful of smartphones all using the same network, it definitely slows down and is disappointing at times. The laptop shared by my family is a couple years old, and a little dated, but is by no mean a bad machine and sometimes when browsing the internet or trying to load videos it is frustratingly slow, and my iphone has its stuttering moments, but with this samsung chromebook it has performed exceptionally on my home's wifi network. It hasn't taken more than a second or two for any webpage to load even with multiple tabs and spotify running in the background. Also I'm a big fan of google play store on the device because you now have so many apps and useful programs at your disposal. Google docs also offers all the average consumer needs in microsoft office, and it's for free. I haven't yet run into an incompatible program or website. The screen is also satisfactory. I have not used it yet outside on a bright sunny day, but it seems that the brightness (which is easily adjusted with keys on the board) gets bright enough so lighting isn't an issue. The resolution is very clear and suits all I need perfectly (clear enough for good res videos and regular use) but if you're expecting a premium, high def, top of the market picture you aren't gunna get it. The chromebook also runs silently--I haven't heard a fan kick in yet--, boots up super quick, and wakes up from sleep instantly and without any lag. The battery life is amazing. I opened it out of the box, hooked it up to the charger(long chord, generic with box thingy on chord), and it booted right up for me to easily sync my gmail account.  Overall; I HIGHLY RECOMMEND a chromebook. Whether it be this model or a different one, I truly believe these are the best options for your money on the market right now. I was scared that I wasn't going to be getting a ""full"" laptop, or miss out on features that a chromebook possibly couldn't offer, but I was wrong. For the average tech user/consumer/student I would recommend a chromebook 10 times out of 10 and this Samsung  is impressive on all levels!","Samsung Chromebook 2 11.6 Inch Laptop (Samsung Exynos, 4 GB, 16 GB SSD, Black)",&49,review4.csv

8,8,Arturo,"February 23, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,Had a few flaws but does the job,"This is a solid Chromebook.Pros:- Battery life is good, usually get 6-8 hours of use between charges- Size and weight, small but plenty big enough to browse the interwebs effectively. Also very light.- Simple user interfaceCons:- Biggest problem is with Chrome OS, crashes frequently. Not really sure what the problem is. I'm not doing anything other then surfing web or watching YouTube videos. Crashes at least 2-3 times during a nightly use session. Really frustrating.- Build quality, a few small drops and there are a few cracks in the frame around the screen and dents on the frame. I know these products aren't intended to be dropped but drops that happened weren't really hard and I was surprised the Chromeback has such damage. Not a huge problem, has not affected performace.- I have a lot of bookmarks and links saved in my Chrome. Sometimes it is slow to open up my bookmarks. Also sometimes browsing the other apps in the Chromebook can be slow. Also loading webpages is sometimes slow but that is more to do with the internet speed.- Some times laggy when surfing or using apps. Could use a bit more RAM to be more effective but you get what you pay for.Overall:I really love this Chromebook and will be buying the 3rd version. For the few problems I've had it has been an absolute pleasure to own. It's small size is great for travelling and still being able to take your laptop with you. It can do what you need for word process, excel type documents and PDF's. It's a really useful item if you don't want a tablet. There are a lot of more expensive competitors especially with the introduction of the tablet/laptops like the Surface Pro 4 and Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro but those are full blown operating systems and are priced starting at $1000 bucks. This Chromebook costing so little and still being able to compete is a no brainer for me. I highly recommend it to everyone whose looking for a new laptop or tablet.Come on Samsung bring out the Chromebook 3 already I'm ready to upgrade.","Samsung Chromebook 2 11.6 Inch Laptop (Samsung Exynos, 4 GB, 16 GB SSD, Black)",&49,review4.csv

10,10,Amazon Customer,"January 21, 2015",3.0 out of 5 stars,This particular model is ho-hum.,"I love and hate this particular Chromebook.  I enjoyed not having to buy an anti-virus program for this OS, as it is installed into the browser.  I also enjoyed using Google's proprietary apps which I found to be better than Microsoft's original versions, and anything I normally do on the internet worked just fine here.  I was unhappy with all the online apps offered in the Chrome Store.  Many are subpar at best.  I also understood at the time I purchased the unit that Chrome Store would be offering more apps that were already available on the Android platform but to date, there's only a handful.  Even with the Android platform coming to Chromebook, this particular model is not getting the update due to it being a non-Intel model.  This Chromebook constantly disconnects from Bluetooth and Wifi.____________________________________________________________________________(old review)I recently got rid of my Windows laptop and decided to try a Chromebook.  My PC habits have changed over the years and with all the applications now available via the cloud, I thought the Chromebook would be a nice, affordable change.  I've been working with Google apps for quite a while on my other PC and tablet and thought I'd give the cloud world a 100% green light.  I've been working with it for 2 months and I'm liking it so far.This particular Chromebook 2 by Samsung is very nice.  I do feel like I have a sturdy product in hand.  I love the fact that when I open it up, it automatically turns on and I can log into my work space in seconds.  I gave this product 4 out of 5 stars because the typing keys already look slightly worn with only 2 months of use, and I'm only on it about an hour a day and not even typing much at that.  However, I have no reason to believe the keys will short out or give up before the life of the product itself.","Samsung Chromebook 2 11.6 Inch Laptop (Samsung Exynos, 4 GB, 16 GB SSD, Black)",&49,review4.csv

12,12,BerkeleyBear,"April 7, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,I love chromebooks now and wish I could give one to everyone I know lol,"I wouldn't even know where to begin with how much I love this chromebook. After several charges, I now get about 5-6 hours of battery life until I need to charge it again. Though, I do recall having up to 8 hours of battery life in the beginning. Going from a heavy/huge laptop (Toshiba Satellite) to this one felt amazing. I love google products and the switch to solely using google drive was natural. Now there is microsoft versions of word, excel, powerpoint, etc. that you can use if you do not like google docs, spreadsheet and slides. I love how light it is, the size is perfect for me as a student since it is not too tiny nor too big for college desks, and the speed in turning on and off. The ONE downside I have with this since I love just about everything about it is that I have issues with printing. You should check to see if your printer is ""cloud-ready"" because if it isn't then you need to use another computer in order to do the cloud printing. Basically what this means is that I find the file on the chromebook, do the print set up and press print, then go to my old laptop and open it up and log in. As soon as you wake up the laptop that has the cloud-ready printing on it, the printer will begin to print. It is not too much of a hassle but I am thinking of just selling my old laptop and this printer (even though it is relatively new) and just buying a cloud-ready printer. I had also bought a tablet not long after (Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 7.0) getting this but ended up selling it because I really had no use for it (I bought it for school but thought this was much more handy so it ended up being just for games). Any of your considering getting a tablet, just get this and try it because it is awesome and is much more practical than a tablet. You won't have to buy extra accessories aside from maybe a case and or screen protector since it already has everything you need.","Samsung Chromebook 2 11.6 Inch Laptop (Samsung Exynos, 4 GB, 16 GB SSD, Black)",&49,review4.csv
13,13,JayKruz_90,"November 9, 2014",4.0 out of 5 stars,I could have easily gotten a refund after I found this out but ...,"I bought this computer because I had to put my macbook pro in the shop for a fan replacement and I attend a school where we use our computers everyday. I wanted something that I could use temporally and at a decent price. First off this computer doesn't work for my school because two programs that we use for class does not run on chrome. I could have easily gotten a refund after I found this out but I fell in love with this computer the minute I took it out of the box.First, I love the size of this computer it's very lightweight and the screen is perfect, even though it is an 11 inch its not too small. All you need is a wifi connection and you're good to go, you can save documents, transfer your music and videos, etc. I'm keeping this computer because it's easier to carry around then my 15 inch macbook pro. I can just sit it on my lap and tap away. My only complaint is that this computer is not compatible with software that isn't made by google, I get that this is why it is called chrome book. I understand not running the same programs as apple or micro soft but programs used by schools should be able to run on a chrome book, if they were a lot more people would have them.So if you're thinking about getting this for school but your school use programs like Repondus or Graph Pad or anything similar, then this can't be your main computer, its good for a backup or recreational use.

14,14,irisch,"August 19, 2014",3.0 out of 5 stars,Looks and feel good but not so sure about performance.,"I don't write many reviews but I felt I should write one on this Chromebook 2.First, let me say I am not new to the Chromebook. I purchased one back in 2012 it was a Samsung and at the time it first came out I forked out $450.00 for it but my wife loved it and used it everyday since the day I bought it. Well, she got her new one yesterday and it took me less then 5 minutes to set it up.Now the look and feel of the new one is much better then the old Chromebook, not saying the old one was that bad. That was the plus side now for the performance. My wife like to watch one soap opera, which she watches everyday. On her old Chromebook it ran great, but on the new one it would pause, skip, and jerk. Now the new unit has 2 gig more memory and a better processor so I didn't expect this.Well, I went on the help forum for the Google Chrome and tried a few things, like turning off extensions and logging on as guest, it helped some but it still runs slower then the old one.My wife is going to give it a couple of days and decide if she wants to send it back. This is why I am only giving it three stars.I also have to be honest with you the soap she watches is on ABC and they don't do videos very well. I try videos from youtube and they work much better. I just feel the overall performance is not as good as the older Chromebook. By the way you can find the old one much cheaper.

15,15,Late Adopter,"May 15, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far so, so good! Fast, simple, polished.","Just came, today. Very easy to set up (including getting Hebrew to work, which I need). Very fast to both boot up and come out of sleep. I'm used to using Macbooks and this is obviously not quite as versatile and polished, but it's actually kind of close in the physical experience -- ie, the keyboard and the touchpad are comparable (and that's high praise for a machine that's maybe a third of the price).Just starting to try the offline capacity, but Google Docs -- the main software I use -- seems to work well offline. Streams Netflix and Hulu well.Starting to notice some things it _can't_ do. The pdf reading capacity is nothing close to what you get with Mac's Preview -- no ability to annotate or edit pdfs (maybe someone will come out with a good app for that like iAnnotate on the iPad). In a more 'critical mission' department, some banking/utility company software doesn't work with the Chrome browser . . . . and with a _Chromebook_, you can't just switch to MS Explorer or Safari or something to see if it works better.Bottom line, it seems like an extraordinary machine for the price, especially if you have (like me) already moved just about everything you do into the cloud (only maybe 8gig of usable hard disk space here).  . . . With the small storage space and the limited software options it feels to me a little bit like something in between a tablet and a full-service computer. But, as with tablets, you seem to get something in return for sacrificing some functionality -- lightening fast performance at what it does do, especially in terms of being almost instantly available from sleep.Great option if you don't need a ton of hard disk space for videos and such and you're not trying to do image editing or desktop publishing.","Samsung Chromebook 2 11.6 Inch Laptop (Samsung Exynos, 4 GB, 16 GB SSD, Black)",&49,review4.csv

First issue: uploading photos from an external hard drive.  Google drive and/or this computer can't handle my 8GB upload of photos, and it keeps crashing or simply cutting the upload off around 2000 files.  Next, the file manager is poor.  I can't delete files from my external HD via the file manager, and I also am unable to see summary statistics for any folder in my google drive (total space, file count, etc.).Next: display issues.  I've hooked up my computer to the TV and it can't mirror screens.  On top of that, the HDMI connection is fragile and crashes chrome browser sometimes or loses the mouse.Next: screenshot problems.  About 50% of the time, my screenshots fail and I have to redo them.Next: media playback.  the standalone video player wouldn't read the video portion of my mkv file.  i'm sure it's a codec issue, but annoying nonetheless.I was swayed by some of the reviews for this product that insisted, yes, even though this is mostly a cloud machine, it is just as good as a real computer.  I see where they're coming from.  If these things worked, I'd be inclined to agree, but as it stands, this is a far inferior product to what I was expecting, and inferior even to the Acer $200 model my wife has, even with the extra computing power.

It is great for what it is advertised for - internet, email, basic surfing.  It supports my candy crush addiction.  It boots up quickly and has great battery life.  Keyboard is a great size. It doesn't get super hot and it has already survived a few drops from a 2-3 foot high table onto carpeted floor that sits next to my recliner.  That being said, it supports a limited number of video codecs so if you want to watch videos on it offline there is a good chance it won't play.  You can do a side boot to ubuntu through the crouton? ""app"" but since this is an ARM based machine, options are limited in Ubuntu.  I could not get flash working in Ubuntu and my videos wouldn't play there either.  I'm not really sold on the fake leather external casing but that isn't really a deal breaker either.  If I had done my research prior to my impulse buy I would have known about the limitations and probably wouldn't have bought it.  I would, however, recommend this for parents or siblings or those who aren't technologically savvy.  This would be great for my parents who used to turn the computer off by flipping the power switch because they would forget how to do it through a windows start ""bar:.  It would also be great for people who ""click on every link"" and download malware with every link they open.

18,18,Steven Williams,"June 21, 2015",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Missing too many features to be a good laptop or internet device, get an Asus or an iPad","I just wanted a cheap laptop, so I thought I'd give ChromeOS a chance.  After using it for a year I wish I'd spent the extra 100$ for a refurbished Macbook or an Asus instead.  Every month or so I try to accomplish some seemingly common task, only to find that there is no way to do it on ChromeOS.  When you count in the amount of time spent trying to find workarounds (if they even exist) the price tag on this ""bargain"" laptop increases pretty rapidly.  I am a highly technical person, so this list is not compiled in ignorance.  Overall feels like Google just wanted you to do things The Google Way.  Linux, Windows, and Mac all have much bigger developer communities so pretty much any task you want to accomplish is possible, not so with ChromeOS.  If you really just want an internet machine get an iPad, better battery life and apps that don't suck.Tasks that suck  SSH.  You can use the developer shell, but it is a pain to use private key files, set up tunnels, or anything else that one would expect. Also with a tiny resolution your window is limited to being 100 characters wide or so, even on a massive external display.  Torrents. JSTorrent sorta works, but its frustrating and slow.  Downloaded Files.  Google doesn't like offline files, cause they can't monetize your usage of them.  Any downloaded file can randomly be deleted.  Netflix is slow, sometimes audio is distorted.

My sister is a teacher whose large school furnished each student with a Chromebook, and after a few months of having them they ordered one for each teacher to phase out the teachers Mac desktops that were used for grading and such.  Google nailed it and is continuing to make it better, Samsung's input is flawless, the build is solid, fake leather feels nice, and who the hell cares about the fake stitching I think it looks great but if that deters you I'd rather know that you don't have one of these so you don't hurt yourself beating it against your head to try and open it.

So I went directly to customer service, reported the problem and went to bed. When I woke up, 5G Sales had already left a response saying that they would send another charger at no additional charge.

No cd drive so you have to try to install programs online..not gonna happen because you can only download window, mac, linux. So how do you get the programs on to your chromebook. YOU DON'T!!!After a 3 hour session of google-ing and trying to find a solution. All there is to do is some coding..sorry I didn't study coding so I can't write code. Shame on me, right?... This is an extremely frustrating device. Spend the extra hundred on an actual PC or go big and spend 700-1200 on an apple product. Seriously this product has leaps and bounds to go before it can be considered par with PCs. Avoid this thing...unless you need to use email or internet.If you want to skype, Line, use quicktime for videos or other common programs this is not the ""computer"" for you. You simply can't install the majority of them.Do yourself a favor. Go on Youtube, search things like ""install skype on google chromebook"". Watch the video and see what kind of process you'll have to go through to install something as simple and common as skype. Coding and other thing most ""common folk"" like me don't know how to do...Nightmare. I wish I would have done some homework before. Now I'm stuck with a computer that has much less available programs than android, apple and linux.At 320 bucks this is a rip off, its Junk avoid.

Everything is great about this machine which i'm writing this review on, however the seal for the device did come broken. I know it says dont accept if the seal is broken however i opened it and nothing was out of place. The device is a great performer, and the octa core really gives it that extra power to do a great job. Screen is pretty good in terms of quality. Great for my online summer school and chrome is a very robust browser for anything on the web. Literally boots in about 5-10 secs and logs in easily. WiFi chip is excellent and battery life is amazing. Charges extremely fast however it also lasts a long time. Really takes a good media beating without killing the battery too much. It was also great to go to the samsung booth and pull out a product they still have yet to release in stores for months. Also design kills all Chromebooks below it except for the 13 inch chromebook 2. I wish the webcam was better though.

0,0,Michael A. F. Dalton,"December 2, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Maybe one of the best laptops ever made for Chromebook users?,"This is a review that I am going to try to keep brief, but I might fail. Here's why: The Samsung Galaxy Chromebook has had some of the most unfair reviews I have ever read about an inanimate object, and I'd like to clear the air of some of those comments.Let's start with the only thing I agree with from so many negative reviews, and that agreement is 'somewhat' at best, and that's the fact that the battery life is not all that great. Some would say it is terrible, I would say that is true if only going by specs alone. But, in real-life usage by a couch potato like myself, is a minor inconvenience. Why? Well, because I do not use my Chromebook in a manner that requires I run on battery power more than 3 or four hours at a time. If after something between 3 and 5 hours, I get low on battery I do what I have always done... I plug it in! I am not being silly, but serious. I plug it in and keep going for a while, then I unplug it and keep going some more.YES, I could not do that in the forest, at the beach, or on a long flight. But my use case does not require that any longer, like it did when I was an executive in the computer business, taking long flights.SO, if your use case or use model allows plugging in now and then, and 3-plus hours will get you what you need and you can plugin for a while at that point, THAT is what real-world usage is like for many many users of this machine.Next, and last, on the agreed-to complaints list of other reviews is that, yes, the machine does heat up sometimes, but no differently than does my $3500 Apple MacBook Pro every now and then. There isn't a lot to say about that, other than it is not constant nor always-so but does occur about as often and gets about as warm, as my Mac laptops have occasionally become.These two main points are in agreement with similar points on other reviews. But many, if not most, of the other points on clearly negative reviews, are less than objective or real-world, in my opinion.For example, I read a review that said the glass screen was so thin if was prone to break, and that the trackpad was just too small, that the hinges were terrible, that the keyboard was terrible, and on and on. All of which is categorically false, and is not a realistic appraisal of the machine, especially when compared with other very high-end laptops, such as some Apple models, some other high-end Chromebooks such as those from Samsung and Google's own offerings.Now... for the sweet sauce, the good points about this amazingly cool little machine... read on.This machine is thin... really thin. So much so, that for the 1st few days I found myself handling it like the newborn baby it was, but soon I reverted to treating it like a laptop computer. All to say this thing is built really well, AND that it is a top-tier piece of precision electronics like a high-end camera or sophisticated medical device. But while it is not unduly delicate, it does deserve a degree of understanding that it is not a 1-inch thick block of ABS plastic, so use and treat it accordingly.Next, the hinges, no complaints from me. Some reviewers claim they are lousy because the lid/screen will oscillate a bit when adjusted. True. And so does every really thin lid machine I have ever owned. Bu tin the real world, we don't do that, do we? We adjust the screen position and carefully, and it stays put.Next, the keyboard, it is every bit as good, and perhaps better than the keys on any Mac portable I've used for the past 5 plus years, in fact, I think it is a little bit better because the key-travel feels a little bit longer, which can make for better feedback and improved speed.No need to comment on the display, it's simply about as good as it can be. Literally. I don't think you can get a better screen on any laptop today. And many of the reviewers panned the machine because of a lack of 4K video material to consume. Someone should tell them it isn't the machine's issue, is it?Sound. The sound is fine, again, consider what you just purchased, it is not a Bose foldback bass design with an array of 6 drivers for sound. It is an amazingly thin laptop, and it sounds just fine. Does it get loud enough? Yes. Does it get really really really loud? No.The hinges are fine, too. My only complaint is that when fully opened into tablet-style, the lid doesn't lock into place, and my copy floated about 1/8th of an inch above the base unit when handheld at an angle. When in tablet configuration and laying flat, as on a desk or table, the lid was flush as it should be. A little annoying at most.All the great features you've read about are absolutely true of this machine. It is simply the best laptop I have ever owned. In terms of the build detail, it meets, and actually, IMPO surpasses, many if not all major laptop manufacturers' latest designs, especially in the Chromebook marketplace, where this machine may be the best, again, depending on your individual feature, functions, and use-case needs.Performance-wise the included i5 10th generation Clearlake U chipset seems to me to outperform or minimally to keep up with my 2015 Google Pixel Chromebook which used an i7 2.6Ghz processor married to 16GB of RAM. This machine I am reviewing has a chip that moves along at 1.6Ghz and throttles up to 3.9 (some spec sheets rate it above 4.x Ghz) and as such I have had zero performance issues even though it has 8 GB of RAM. So performance-wise, I am very pleased.Would I have been happy if I'd spent $1,000 (actually $999) on this machine? Well, my 2015 machined aluminum, best of breed, Google Pixel Chromebook (the second release in that brand/line) cost me over $1,200 when new, and I never looked back. This machine was discounted to $799 a year ago, and now that it is replaced with the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2, this original Galaxy Chromebook can be had for $599 new while inventory supplies are available. At that price, I would replace it in a micro-second if mine was damaged or lost.Those of us who have been Chromium OS and Chromebook pioneers have been rewarded with an ever increase of Chromebook capabilities in both the hardware and the apps and operating system. This machine, the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook (original version) is a real winner in every way, and while battery life is not top-of-class, this reviewer asserts that pretty much everything else is, and for $600, I am very happy with my purchase.I hope this review has been helpful, regardless of what you end up purchasing when shopping for your next Chromebook computer.","SAMSUNG 13.3” Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM,4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, Ultra Slim Design, Chrome OS, WiFi 6, Mercury Gray",&859,review5.csv

2,2,'grat,"February 17, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice chromebook with a problem,"For features, function, appearance, weight, and even price, it's hard to beat the Galaxy Chromebook.  Battery life is somewhat limited, but it makes up for it with a beautiful touch-screen, decent sound, and a (relatively) lightweight package.But Samsung has a serious quality-control issue going on.  I understand that things happen, and I don't expect every piece of electronics to be perfect-- however, when my first Galaxy Chromebook arrived, and it immediately sprang to life, the screen remained dark.  Multiple resets later, the screen still never even flickered.  No backlighting, and no apparent activity on the screen.  After contacting Amazon, who referred me to Samsung, Samsung came to the conclusion I had-- the screen wasn't connected internally.  Samsung suggested an Amazon replacement would be better than sending it to Samsung and waiting for the usual service turnaround, so I contacted Amazon, and arranged for a replacement.Two days later, the replacement shows up (both brand new, by the way-- no refurbs), and while the screen lights up in all it's glory, the battery charge indicator continues blinking.  The system will not charge.  The task bar doesn't show a battery AT ALL.  Open crosh with ctrl-alt-t, run 'battery_firmware info', and I'm told there is no battery.  *sigh*At this point, I've received two dead systems, and the project I bought it for has a time component.  Out of desperation, I did some investigation, and determined that removing the bottom cover is actually pretty easy, as was locating the connector for the battery.  A light press on the connector, followed by a noticeable click, and the system now has a functional battery.  The connector has a piece of clear yellow tape on top, suggesting Samsung knows this is a weak point.Basic quality control should include verifying the screen works, the charger works, and the battery works.  Obviously, neither Chromebook I received passed all three of these tests.This is a very nice piece of equipment, totally let down by a rushed production line.","SAMSUNG 13.3” Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM,4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, Ultra Slim Design, Chrome OS, WiFi 6, Mercury Gray",&859,review5.csv

A portable Amoled 13.3 inch monitor would probably cost around $700-1000 ! .  Yes the battery life is not great - about 4.5 -5 hours -  but I would not sit  that long on a single charge anyways and if I do I would plug it in or use a portable power bank.  What surprised me was  how good Chrome OS is, using it for the first time.  I think Chrome OS should be a mainstream operating system and windows 10/11 should be for an office environment.  On Chrome OS I use microsoft office , outlook, word and Excel downloaded from chrome web store, but most of the time I use it for reading , web browsing and youtube - and this is where the 4K Amoled is great.

Besides the OS, eventough Lenovo's equipment is a terrific equipment and value for the price and performs well for its segment, I wanted something more powerful because I use 70% for work and 30% personal matter. And I'm using my Samsung instead my work's Dell Latitude with latest core i7 vPro 16 GB RAM, the issue is portability and it uses 70% if its power in security stuff loaded by my company. And I gotta say Samsung Galaxy Chromebook performs waaay better.Everything in it it's perfect and as many almost all know, battery is an ""issue"" because does to last as long as regular Chromebooks but man, consider, the amazing 13.3 in 4K AMOLED screen takes its part of the juice, also the i5 processor if you demand for power but at the end, nothing to worry about if you reduce screen brigthness and have moderate usage. I was concerned about that but know I realize it is not the issue many say.I know I just jumped from top of bottom segment to top of top and belive me, once you do, there's no turning back. Fortunately there's a lot of more affordable options with great specs and just little more dimensions.","SAMSUNG 13.3” Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM,4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, Ultra Slim Design, Chrome OS, WiFi 6, Mercury Gray",&859,review5.csv
6,6,Kindle Customer1,"May 29, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great computer, bad battery.","TL;DR great computer with cool features but compromised battery for thinness. The first thing I have to say is that the screen quality is superb and paired with tablet mode is a defiant win in my book. The s pen is muchmore functional on a Note 20 ultra than a computer, it is a cool gimmick and makes presentations easier because of the red dot feature. The i5 is a medium stage processor, I was going to buy a dell with an i7 but decided that the i5 was good enough, the thinness is also extremely convenient having a decent computer without added weight. There are a few cons though, the battery life is comparable to the note 20 ultra running full boar. This computer also only runs chrome which can be a downside to some but not to me. The c charger on both sides is one of the best parts of this computer because now I only need the fast charger it came with to charge my phone, computer, or headphones. The lighted keyboard makes a big difference in the dark and the camera near the keyboard made to take photos in tablet mode is cool because it looks like a big note 20. It also says on streaming services that it is running 8k but the screen is only capable of 4k. Overall this is a good student computer and worth the money, but if you need the windows just buy the new galaxy book pro. 6.9inch note 20 ultra for scale, 1:1 scale on both s pens. Viewing screen size is the same as the note 20 ultra, about 1.5 the size of an s8+ of note 20 ultra thickness wise. This thing is phone thin.

After trying to find a keyboard cover and hardshell cover, I came to realize per many reviews that the high resolution screen is battery intensive to a fault, as well as heat producing. Some say the battery will only last 4 hours. The large perforated area on the bottom is to dissipate the heat generated by the power hungry screen. Honestly, I just took it out of the box and put it back and returned it after realizing there were no keyboard covers or polycarbonate cases for this model. Although I never actually even turned it on, if you read the reviews and see the screen resolution, you will see why the aftermarket industry leaves it alone. I think the screen overburdens the device.","SAMSUNG 13.3” Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM,4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, Ultra Slim Design, Chrome OS, WiFi 6, Mercury Gray",&859,review5.csv
8,8,Jed Rothwell,"March 23, 2021",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not reliable. First unit and and replacement unit both crash and hang.,"This is a beautiful little Chromebook. It is light, with a high resolution screen, and a nice keyboard. Unfortunately, it is unreliable. I got one about a month ago. Several times a day it crashed. It stopped while I was working, or when I opened the top to turn it back on, it had crashed back to the sign-on screen with a message: ""Chrome didn't shut down correctly."" It also hung up, refusing to turn on until you held the power key for 20 seconds. Also, it did not work with the wi-fi extender. A ""powerwash"" reset did not help.Amazon gave me a replacement unit with no argument. It arrived yesterday. Yesterday it crashed once, and hung up once. Today it crashed again. Modern computer equipment is reliable so this is unusual. I do not think it is a coincidence that two out of two are unreliable.In my opinion, the designers put too much effort into strange features such as the stylus, and a non-working fingerprint detection key. (I finally got it to register after several attempts, but it does not sign on to anything.) They should have made it more reliable instead.I will probably keep it, because a Chromebook is more of a glorified i-Pad more than it is a computer. As long as you can browse, it is okay, even if it crashes unexpectedly. It has various applications such as word processing, but they are all the Google on-line versions, so you do not lose your work when it crashes. I will keep this one, but I would not recommend it to anyone.I recommend Chromebooks in general. For my purposes they are much better than laptop computers. I had another one for many years, from another maker. It never had problems like this. It finally died of old age, but it was reliable for a long time.FOLLOW UP: The replacement unit crashed 5 times in one day, so I returned it for a refund. Again, Amazon did not give me any trouble. They suggested I contact Samsung and tell them I had problems with two units. The woman at Samsung said, ""we have not heard of any problems like that."" I told her to come here to Amazon and read these reviews. I have a feeling that someone in their organization is not letting the bad news about this product spread through the company.","SAMSUNG 13.3” Galaxy Chromebook Laptop Computer w/ 256GB Storage, 8GB RAM,4K AMOLED Touchscreen Display, Ultra Slim Design, Chrome OS, WiFi 6, Mercury Gray",&859,review5.csv

I'd read other raves about the 4K AMOLED screen (made by Samsung), but seeing was almost not believing.  Colors are so deep, so brilliant, and when you switch a YouTube video from regular high def to 4K resolution, it becomes crystal clear - best way to describe it is that it appears I'm looking at a real image through glass.  Specs for the 13.3 inch screen are 3840 X 2160 pixels, which some think is overkill but I disagree because of the pure viewing pleasure it provides.  The rest of the hardware is super fast and a quality build.

Matthew Hawkins,"May 10, 2021",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice Design, But Unreliable Performance","The machine's design is sleek, video images are sharp and clear, the computer is lightweight, however, the big problem with this computer is that it is extremely buggy, which makes it unreliable if you are trying to get work done.Although the touch screen always seems to work well enough, you will lose many hours of productive time when the trackpad fails and, of course, it always fails at the most inconvenient times.Also, the backlight on the keyboard only works occasionally. There is no telling when it will or will not work. This makes the computer unreliable when it comes to getting work done. But it looks nice.The printed letters and numbers on the keyboard are often difficult to read due to a lack of contrast against the color of the keys.

Yes, it is sleek and lightweight, which I do appreciate.  However, many key design features make it really uncomfortable to use.  For starters, the screen is highly reflective - so much so, that it is difficult to see what is on the screen.  Right now, I have a beautiful view through the window behind me; however, I can barely see what I am typing.  I am constantly turning the screen brightness to the max simply to cut through the reflections.  Second, the contrast on the keyboard is way too low; the letters themselves are all but invisible.  The letters are light gray on medium grey keys.  So, I am also constantly turning up the brightness on the keyboard.  Last but not least, the webcam is really terrible - my image is fuzzy at best, and, unless the room is extremely bright, I am shrouded in darkness.  For some reason, this device has a high res cam that faces outwards, and another one which faces upwards (just above the keyboard).  Why are these so good, while the webcam is so bad?

If you just want to use it to surf the internet and that sort of thing, can't beat the price.  I knew the screen wasn't going to be the best before i bought it, and in fairness the images are a little flat, but again I just use it as an internet surfer platform.  HOWEVER,..., what i wish I did know before i bought it, and would have been a reason why i WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT IT is the ports available.  It DOES NOT have an HDMI port, only the mini port which is how you charge it.  So i would also use my Chrome book to watch streaming on my TV, connecting it to my larger TV, to do so i had to buy an adapter to plug in a full size HDMI into the mini, but in doing so you CANNOT charge it, so if you are watching a movie, or anything you have to run off battery power, it will always have enough to get you through a movie, but the stress of watching the batter life slowly march down to zero really plays on my anxiety.  Further there is only one USB port, so if you have a cordless mouse plugged in you can't plug in any other USB, example, if you want to download from your phone you have to unplug the cordless mouse, which drives me nuts.  But do note that it has bluetooth capabilities so you can always get a blue tooth mouse to solve that problem, I'm just not tech savy enough to pull that off.  in the end the lack of a full size HDMI AND also a charger would make me buy a different machine, but i already have it, and i make it work, stress and all when running it off battery at my work station or TV.  Just something i wish i had looked into more before i bought it.  Hope that helps.

The specs are the same, labeling and serials match up, but no micro slot. Ok so I exchanged it for another one since it was probably a fluke but NOPE my replacement also came sans micro slot. Finally figured it out that the the one with the slot was manufactured in 1/21 and the one without was 5/21. Apparently the 5/21 was in the midst of the chip crisis, so Samsung redesigned the chassis to omit the SD feature,  and subsequently scrubbed future models of the SD being standard. The owners manual was even changed to reflect SD being an ""option"". Dishonest and frustrating but not illegal. I'm disappointed but luckily it is not a deal breaker, just a feature I was expecting.*Original*Honestly so great for school use. I've got one in public high school and one in virtual high school- Public child broke her mid range full size laptop so we bought her this as a 'punishment' of sorts, cause compared to her other one this is a pos (spec wise) and because she needed one for school. Was not about to be on the hook for a school computer either. Once she got all set up on it, Virtual child became jealous and wanted her own, despite the fact she has a top of the line full size laptop. It's been going so well for Public child that we decided to get one for Virtual too. Honestly it's basic and if all you're doing on it is web browsing and school work, this is the end all be all of your shopping. I bought the 4gig models but we also have external drives and memory cards they can work off of if need be. Has no issues connecting to public school wifi or home wifi, no issues at all, actually.

If that matters, a less distracting grayscale over an addictive color display would be desirable.

The colors look magnificent- it is extremely fast- I haven't had any problems with windows 11 so far. I've had this laptop almost three months. The battery life could be better, but I gave it five stars because it still lasts what I feel is a long time, and it charges back up quickly- even when you're on it while it is charging.I love the backlight on the keyboard- perfect for using at night while you're in bed.

It cracked just by transporting it in my cushioned backpack.BTW, if you pay the repair, they replace the parts with the same ones, so it will happen again.

But it was a total workhorse for work and home use. And needed replacement.After *lots* of reading and research I landed on the Samsung Galaxy Book Pro, in no small no part because my Samsung Galaxy 10+ phone has done so well.Also? This was in stock! Several others I looked at were either out when I started looking, or went to backorder while I was on the hunt. And the Amazon 5-payment plan was a little kinder on my budget.Screen is incredible. Backlit keyboard. RAM is nearly triple what my old machine had (16gb v 6), so using Photoshop now is no big deal while I'm using several other apps simultaneously. It sure used to be. And it takes about a second - yep - once you flip the screen open to wake.Downside? It's *very* thin and *very* light compared to my old machine, so that's taken some getting used to. I need to hold it in place while I open the screen. And right now it actually sits ON the old one when I'm working. But it's still new yet.Looks like it's a bit more expensive now ( I paid about $1100) but I think still a deal for what you'll be getting, esp if you haven't upgraded in a while as was my case.Highly recommend.","Samsung Galaxy Book Pro Windows 11 Intel Evo Platform Laptop Computer 15.6"" AMOLED Screen 11th Gen Intel Core i7 Processor 16GB Memory 512GB SSD Long-Lasting Battery, Mystic Blue",&1049,review7.csv

The whole left side from top to bottom row not space bar got hot and all the way over to the 6 key. It was plugged in when this happened just doing the setup. On the battery the y-under side gets warm and this was just surfing the web. It is really light, the screen is really nice. It is not a touch screen which doesn't bother me, but Windows 11 is geared more to the touch screen. The battery will not last 20 hours like they say in description. I just did 1 hour of surfing and I lost 25% of the battery just surfing.All in all it is a good laptop for now. We got it on sale so I grab it. I got the midnight blue, wanted the white, but white was listed as Chrome OS and I wanted Windows. I  believe the laptop is worth it but we will test it more and try to update the review.update: still getting heat issues when downloading or sometimes just when charging on the left side of the unit.  when downloading tonight it got so warm and the fan was so loud trying to cool it off.","Samsung Galaxy Book Pro Windows 11 Intel Evo Platform Laptop Computer 15.6"" AMOLED Screen 11th Gen Intel Core i7 Processor 16GB Memory 512GB SSD Long-Lasting Battery, Mystic Blue",&1049,review7.csv
0,0,Steph,"May 11, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth every penny!,"After spending alot of time researching many different chromebooks, tablets and laptops in the $200-500 that would best suit my needs I found myself getting frustrated and overwhelmed by the process and was about 30 seconds from giving up and settling on one that was not ideal just to get the process over with. That is when this beauty miraculously appeared! Not only did it check 9 out of 10 of the boxes I needed it to, it was also 1/2 the price compared to others I researched in this category.  I love the design and versatility of having a laptop and tablet in one option.  I also like that unlike some of the other 2 in 1 chromebooks it is not flimsy and they clearly took into consideration the lifestyle needs of a 2 in 1 chromebook keeping it lightweight yet very sturdy. The battery life is wonderful, it charges quickly and a full charged has lasted me over a full day at work as I used it continuously for a total of 10.45hrs before it got down to the red at 15%. And that was without turning on the battery saver option! The display is clean, crisp & vivid. Whether it's used for streaming a movie or creating a new document, you will be satisfied with the visuals for sure. Set up was a breeze as was learning the ins and outs of all this chromebook offers. The only ""complaint"" I have in regards to this specific model is the lack of protective cases designed to fit it. I understand this is not a issue about the product itself but I did want to make people aware of it as there is only 1 brand of hard cover cases that fit it and do not have to be removed for use(mCover hard shell case for 12.2in Samsung v2 chromebook).I highly recommend also using a padded waterproof shock absorbent carry case as well for travel, as the hard case is mainly to protect from scratches and dings and WILL NOT protect it in the event it is dropped, banged or similar.  The other recommendation is a 9H screen protector, especially if you plan to use the touch screen and stylist pen options. If I could give it 10stars I would.

5,5,Person,"February 1, 2020",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome battery life, heavier than expected, pen is fine","I like this computer.I received it yesterday and spent the entire evening getting used to it. The laptop comes with a stylus, and a power cable. I think it's made of plastic but it feels pretty solid, and it's way heavier than I expected. I fear I may drop it because of it's weight. Out of the box it has no power, you must plug it in to the wall with your provided cable.Some issues are that there is one dead pixel that has been present ever since I turned on the device. I don't really care for it as it's so tiny, but I know that some may not be okay with it for it appears to be an irremovable speck of dirt. Another issue is that the stylus has a bit of delay. Another is that the scrolling is a bit wonky in Android apps, I can not use two fingers on the mouse pad to scroll in the Discord app for example, but I can use the pen/my finger to operate it from the screen as I would on my phone. This makes sense since it is an Android app after all, but it'd be nice to not have to switch back and forth from laptop to pen abilities. The app drawer is only properly functionable when using the pen or your finger.I fell asleep with it the laptop on, and woke several hours later. My battery did not empty in my absence of activity, and none of my progress was lost. Though it did not lock my screen, but I am pretty sure I can fix that in the settings. I am just amazed that it did not die and nothing was lost even though I left it for several hours. The laptop is also extremely quiet I now realize, I have not heard a single mechanical noise coming from it and I am typing this from a silent room.Also, Chrome OS isn't that bad, I had planned to attempt to download Ubuntu on it, I am still going to get it to have more useful software available, but I will also use Chrome OS since it's not as bad as I thought it would be.Overall the computer is pretty epic","Samsung Chromebook Plus V2, 2-in-1, 4GB RAM, 32GB eMMC, 13MP Camera, Chrome OS, 12.2"", 16:10 Aspect Ratio, Light Titan (XE520QAB-K01US)",&299,review8.csv
6,6,David Edwards,"March 27, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's more like ""2/3 laptop, 1/3 tablet"" rather than a 2-in-1.","I've been in the market for a cheap laptop for work for a while.  I have a hefty gaming PC at home but I wanted something completely separate and portable for non-gaming needs like using the internet and word processing.  Additionally I've been trying to read more and sometimes this leads to me using the Kindle app on my phone.  I was drawn to the Chromebook Plus (V2) because of the attempts to make it more like a tablet and utilize Android apps.Overall the product works exactly as described.  The screen is good, though the default settings make the things like the app shelf, window borders, and pointer size a little too large in comparison to the parts of the screen in use.  This is variable once you poke around the settings, though, and I have no complaints.  The keyboard is fantastic and responsive.  The touchscreen is pretty good, though it's not quite on par with the perfection that is an iPad touch screen.  Sometimes I miss when I try to click on things with my finger or perhaps it doesn't register at all.  That happens so infrequently that it's still entirely usable.  The pen is also nice, though I've only used it so far to doodle in the Google Keep notes app as it was not a main selling point for me.  The battery life is about on par with what is advertised; I used it lightly from 7:30-2:30 yesterday, for example, and it only got to about 50%.  The foldability for tent and tablet mode is a little bit awkward considering the size and the fact that the keyboard is always attached, but it works.  It just makes me prefer it as a laptop more than a tablet most of the time.The performance is acceptable considering the hardware.  With my other machine having a much more powerful processor and more RAM, I actually do notice a bit of delay in navigation online and when using multiple apps.  With that said, it's not bad at all, and the comparison is actually rather unfair.My main complaint is really only the quality of the touchpad for using the cursor.  It works well, but it's a little bit choppy and doesn't respond to light and subtle movements when trying to be precise.  Again, this might be unfair because the only recent laptops I've used have been MacBooks and those touchpads are incredibly smooth, but it's still worth pointing out.Overall I'm highly satisfied with my purchase.  The problems I've described really aren't even problems but rather little quirks that I've already gotten used to.

If you try to do much more with it, you might be disappointed. I'm ok with the $350 Black Friday price, but would be disappointed if I spent $500 on this, so giving it 3 stars instead of 4. Paying $600 for the m3 processor would be too much for this class of device, especially with only 4gb ram. It does fine for browsing, but Android apps can be kind of glitchy.  Touch responsiveness can be spotty in tablet mode. This might be ChromeOS' fault, but it's an advertised feature and should be expected to work. Using a 2k external monitor over usb-c works, but is choppy. I'm guessing this is a combination of the low ram and integrated graphics (cpu usage wasn't high). I wouldn't do it regularly. I like that is has 2 usb-c ports, but putting them both on the same side is annoying. The screen half is much heavier than other laptops I've used and makes it hard to balance on your lap. The camera on the body is pointless unless you plan to take photos in tablet mode (don't be that person). The keyboard is fine, but the touchpad is a little cramped. This just comes with the territory on this size device.Basically it does a lot of things adequately and not much more. If you're ok with that, you might like it.

However, it does have one built-in USB 3.0 connection, so you don't need an adapter for USB sticks.Wi-fi performance appears to be a little weak compared to some other devices I have, but has worked okay.","Samsung Chromebook Plus V2, 2-in-1, 4GB RAM, 32GB eMMC, 13MP Camera, Chrome OS, 12.2"", 16:10 Aspect Ratio, Light Titan (XE520QAB-K01US)",&299,review8.csv
18,18,Dsol303,"November 16, 2021",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the hype. Glitchy and heavy,"I was really excited to try a Chromebook and searched around through many of them before choosing this one. I wanted it for my travels as something smaller that could fit in my purse or bag. Unfortunately during my trip there were many times when I would try to turn it on and it just would not turn on. Or it would be frozen up. And it was brand new. The battery life lasts a long time but what's the point when I can't get it to even turn on or open a program. And although the size was right, or I thought it was, it is actually very heavy for its size. The weight of it in my purse actually made my shoulders hurt where my purse strap was. It's quite hefty. It doesn't seem like it for the first few minutes but as you continue on with it you can really feel its weight. At this size I feel like it's kind of pointless. It's not small enough to easily fit in a purse or small bag, and definitely not light enough. But it's also too small to be a decent laptop for home. Unfortunately by the time I got back from my trip, only having used it a couple times, the return window had closed and so I'm not able to return it. So now I'm stuck with this. If the seller could contact me so I can return this it would be great.","Samsung Chromebook Plus V2, 2-in-1, 4GB RAM, 32GB eMMC, 13MP Camera, Chrome OS, 12.2"", 16:10 Aspect Ratio, Light Titan (XE520QAB-K01US)",&299,review8.csv

0,0,Tech nerd,"November 13, 2020",5.0 out of 5 stars,Lightest laptop I have ever owned!,"Don't believe the negative reviews! This is a great laptop.The best thing about this laptop is the screen then the weight. The Qled screen is absolutely the best LCD screen on the market with superior brightness, saturation and color accuracy. The 13.3"" size screen in full HD is just beautiful and I believe they have applied an anti-reflective coating on the glass screen. So even though the screen is glossy there is very little refraction. The Ion is the only model with this AR coating. It is very similar to the 13"" macbook pro screen but not as high resolution. In other words unless you have an OLED panel you will not find a better looking screen on any other laptop!!The performance of this device is actually very good but I really think they could have used AMD Ryzen processors with much better results. The i7 this laptop uses is fast but it is not on the newer 10nm architecture which I would have preferred. I would have also preferred 12gb ram as a base for all models. All of that being said this thing is very fast for what it is. My complaints are more about future proofing. For what I use this laptop for it is very fast.Now to the build quality and other features. The build and design of this laptop is one of my favorites of 2020. It has excellent industrial design and minimal bezels. Fit and finish are very good but not perfect. The silver finish is very good at resisting fingerprints. The keyboard is excellent. The glass trackpad is also excellent and can charge your phone!Battery life is also very good. The claims by Samsung are inflated as are all battery life claims on a laptop but what I can say is for an ultra portable the 69 watt hour battery is very large and will get your through a solid day. That is with screen brightness on high, cpu performance set to high.The speakers on this laptop are great and get very loud and have a good amount of bass. You have to get updates for the drivers in samsung update and then adjust the settings in realtek audio console but once you do the sound is amazing. I look at how small this thing is and the sound coming out of it and I am impressed.To wrap it all up this is one of my favorite laptops to use. It is not a speed demon but it can handle it's own, it is super light and portable with great battery life. It does everything I need it to do and has a decent selection of ports including a thunderbolt 3 port. The fit and finish and design are all great. I really like the magnesium build. It does have some flex here and there because it is not using a thick piece of aluminum but a thinner stronger piece of Magnesium. I would just say that you should look for sales. The full retail price is too high IMO but the sale price is a good value considering the features you can only get in this laptop and the competition in the same price range.Samsung has really done an excellent job with it's offerings this year. I am very excited to see what is to come.

Almost too lightweight in a sense that I forget it’s in my bag when I’m carrying it. The screen and sound are good. Nothing crazy high quality but good enough to watch a movie when your kids are stealing the three other TVs in the house. I mainly use it for teaching and normal home use and I love everything about it… EXCEPT… one small detail that is turning out to be a big annoyance. The shift key on the right hand side is tiny… I mean smaller than every other keyboard that I have ever used due to the thumbprint key. I wish I could get rid of it in place of a normal size shift key. Overall… I hate to say I wouldn’t buy this computer because of ONE key… but man… there have been many curse words uttered when having to backspace because I missed the shift key in the middle of typing.UPDATE - I have had this computer for a few months now and it’s great. However, my school I teach at has gone virtual and the battery doesn’t last me a full day, not unless on the absolute lowest power settings which isn’t realistic to work on for 8 hours.

2,2,Alemore,"December 25, 2020",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Beautiful laptop, very light weight with an excellent screen","First of all, I have to say that this is the lightest laptop that I've ever owned. The specs are very good. There are some small quirks that I've had to learn to live with though. First of all, even though I like the fingerprint sensor for logging in, they cut the right shift key in half to place the fingerprint sensor there. I have had to get used to that particular modification since I kept missing the shift key.The shell of the laptop flexes, especially the bottom where the vents are. I feel as if I need to be especially careful not to squeeze the laptop to avoid bending the casing. This hasn't happened so it may be me, but I don't want to tempt fate either.The mouse pad is nice but sensitivity may be a tad high. I often engage the pad with my right palm when using the keyboard. I haven't found a way to throttle down the sensitivity.For a laptop in this class, Samsung chose to include a traditional power plug instead of the newer magnetic type. Bad move by them there. A magnetic type of power cord would be perfectly fitting for this laptop and enhance it's respectability.Ok now, aside from the above, there are so many things that I love about this laptop. The laptop is very light weight. It is beautiful to look at from the outside. The lit keyboard is nice. The screen is absolutely beautiful. The keyboard keys feel good. Aesthetically, this laptop is a winner - no doubt. For that reason, all the things that I don't like are overshadowed by how nice this laptop is. But at the price point, I feel that the quirks should not have been let go so it's only fair to take off one star for overall lack of value.",Samsung Galaxy Book Ion 15.6” Laptop| QLED Display and Intel Core i7 Processor | 8GB Memory | 512GB SSD | Long Battery Life and Windows 10 Operating System | (NP950XCJ-K01US),&1291,review9.csv
3,3,David,"February 19, 2021",2.0 out of 5 stars,Mediocre product for a premium price,"Samsung Product SupportThe laptop arrived with a faulty pixel. Amazon told me to contact Samsung support. I tried to do that but since I’m in Europe, the Samsung support site would not allow me to contact them through their web forms or chat function (there is no email). The site just kept complaining that I’m in the wrong region. So I contacted the local Samsung Service Centre but they refused to serve the product since it wasn’t bought in Europe. With Samsung you are always in the wrong region it seems.Warranty wise, If you want to travel I would therefore not recommend Samsung products. This is too bad, really, because the laptop would be a pretty good travel companion. It’s very light for its size.The batteryThe battery is one of the best features. It is very good and you can limit charging to 85% in order to preserve battery health.The ScreenI’m quite baffled by the many glowing reviews of this screen. The only really good thing about this screen is the brightness which is quite amazing, but the screen is very reflective so even with that brightness, it can be hard to use it outdoors.There is a lot of back bleeding, and the contrast is really not that good. I’ve used many lcd-screens that are better in that regard (and I’m not talking about oled screens). The lowest brightness setting is also still pretty bright so it’s not great for night use either.The KeyboardThe keyboard is ok, a bit cramped and off-center because of the numpad but ok. The keyboard backlight is very bad however. The automatic brightness detection frequently turns on the brightness even during bright conditions which makes the keys almost impossible to see since they are white. You can manually override the brightness in windows, so it’s only slightly annoying in that case. But in linux you have no control over keyboard backlight so then it becomes more of an issue.The FanIn silent mode, the fan is almost never on and there is no coil whining so it’s dead silent most of the time should you want to use that mode.The touchpadThe touchpad is downright bad. Two finger scrolls are terrible. It frequently fails to activate or it activates the drag function instead. Two finger clicks are also a hit-and-miss affair, with the cursor jumping wildly when you try to use it (also sometimes marking texts in the process). I'm not even that picky when it comes to touchpads, but compared to the last five touchpads I've used (chromebooks and regular Windows laptops) this one is the worst by far and the only one I feel the need to use a regular mouse with.Linux compatibilityLinux works reasonably well, with the only real problem being the lack of control of keyboard backlight (the brightness still works, you just can’t control it). The sound will probably not work out of the gate, but can be fixed if you google the problem.I could not get the fingerprint reader to work either, but that is a minor issue.In conclusionA very bright (but not very good) screen, excellent battery life, light and silent (if you are willing to sacrifice some performance by using silent mode), but otherwise a very mediocre product for a premium price. Samsung after sale support is not very supporting.Update: The laptop got a BIOS (...or EUFI to be correct) update and now the touchpad is working much better. I no longer have any complaints about two finger scrolling and clicking. The touchpad is now perfectly fine, this also holds true for Linux use.",Samsung Galaxy Book Ion 15.6” Laptop| QLED Display and Intel Core i7 Processor | 8GB Memory | 512GB SSD | Long Battery Life and Windows 10 Operating System | (NP950XCJ-K01US),&1291,review9.csv

The battery life is much longer and charges fast.  The screen is bright and looks good; easy to view.  A minor complaint is the speakers, but I generally don't have them very loud, anyway...it isn't that a big of a deal for me though I don't use it for Zoom or similar activities.  I do a lot of simple games on it, and they function well.  Occasionally after I have opened a game and am engaged in it, it will suddenly flip back to the game selection menu but the active game is on the task bar and opens right up....haven't figured out why it does that.  My biggest complaint is that the fingerprint ID security function is hit and miss whether it works or not; generally I just use my pin to access.

5,5,Sam,"July 15, 2020",5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a real innovation.,"This is my third Samsung Ultrabook laptop since 2013 July.  The reason why I only have used Samsung Ultrabook series is that the laptop is really light. For example, the first generation is about 2.7 LB (it was purchased in 2013 July). The second generation is about 1.8LB (it was purchased in 2018 November). The previous models have some issues (e.g., battery life, display quality, and so on). However, the Galaxy Book Ion (the third generation of Samsung Ultrabook series) overcame all issues. For example, you can operate the laptop without charger about 10 hours.  Also, charging speed is so fast. In addition the touch pad has wireless charger function. The sound quality is so great (Although I have Bose NC-700, Sony WH-1000XM3, and Airpod Pro, I listen a music from the laptop without any headset in my home). I purchased the 15.6 inch for upgrading RAM (13.3 inch may not support ram upgrade). Because the screen is so clear , I believe that the laptop seems to be customized for Prime video, Netflix, and Youtube. Lastly, the design is what I wanted.

10,10,sara,"January 23, 2021",1.0 out of 5 stars,Light on weight. Heavy on regret.,"With my old laptop failing due to age I spent some time researching available options for replacement. I settled on the Samsung Galaxy Book Ion 15 for a number of reasons. The only shortcomings were the low memory and small drive space. Both of those are upgradeable in the 15"" model so I ordered the upgrades for both at the same time as the laptop.  After opening the case to put in the new upgrades I found that the screw to retain the second NVMe drive wasn't there. Having watched videos of others placing in a new drive in this same laptop as well as seeing pictures of the process I knew this screw was certainly supposed to be there. I contacted Samsung support only to be told my options were to either order the screw from their parts supplier (at my cost) or to send the entire unit in to be serviced.  This laptop is needed to replace a now non functioning laptop used for work. I went 2 days without one while the new laptop was shipped. I can't afford to send the laptop away for who knows how long and simply not get any work done in the meantime. I also shouldn't be expected to pay for the mistakes made at the facility where this laptop was assembled.  To add further insult to injury, I noticed a spot on the screen when there was a light colored background. At first sight I figured it was a speck of dust on the screen or the like. It wouldn't wipe away. It wasn't even on the screen. It's under the screen. It doesn't appear to be a dead pixel. Possibly a bit of dust that got under the glass during assembly? No matter it's cause, it's there. And of course now that I know that it's there, it's all I can see.  So after nearly $1500 into the laptop and it's upgrades I expected to be thrilled with my new work laptop for years to come. Instead, I am left with massive regret for my costly, poor quality purchase that I can't afford to send back. I'm stuck with this.  Samsung quality failed me and their own support department chose to discard a new customer rather than make it right.

I can honestly say if the display wasn't so awesome I would have probably sent this laptop back but a good clear, good, bright display is very important to me.

44,44,"Dr. Jerry Parks, National Teacher's Hall of Fame, 2009","June 11, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,“Simply the nicest laptop I’ve ever owned. Period.”,"I currently own six laptops, and have owned Latitudes, Elitebooks, XPS models, Pavilions, Surface Pros, Thinkpads, Envy’s, etc. This is the finest one I’ve ever owned, even though I never imagined buying a Samsung laptop!First off, it’s so very light. Secondly, I’ve never seen, much less owned, a screen so bright and deeply saturated. And when it turns on (about 4 seconds), and you hit F10, the colors go from gorgeous to unbelievable. Yes, the screen brightness is what I love most. And to get that Samsung QLED screen on steroids, well, it is unparalleled in color brightness. The high-end Elitebook with the 1000-nit screen was close, but it had what I call a ‘rolling shadow’ every time the screen was moved forward or backward. Not a flaw, just the way many were made. Not on the ION. Move that lid backward or forward and no ‘shadow’…ever.This bright screen does not hurt the battery much, either. The laptop won’t get 21 hours, but with fine-tuning it will last many hours. As others have noted, the sound is not great, but who really buys a laptop depending on its sound. I also love the tiny lighted (!) AC plug-in to the laptop, and the blazing-fast fingerprint reader is flawless.The 10th Gen. i7 processor just flies. Files copy really fast, and everything moves like it was 2023! Size-wise this thing is THIN. Slips into virtually any purse or protective case as smooth as butter. More than once I thought I was pulling out my iPad.  The keyboard isn’t a Latitude, but it’s a pleasure to use. Brightly lighted too.Small negatives—the fan runs constantly, and the bottom gets pretty warm, even with the roll-under screen edge meant to increase airflow. Also, it’s not as inexpensive as others like it—especially now with a chip shortage. But that’s just the point. The Galaxy ION isn’t like others. It’s QUALITY Samsung-built, and much nicer than the Galaxy Flex. No comparison. And it doesn’t hurt that the reliability of Samsung laptops has moved them up considerably.Again, this is the nicest (and brightest!) laptop I’ve ever owned. And the lightest. I can’t find much about it to complain about. And…it’s beautiful!",Samsung Galaxy Book Ion 15.6” Laptop| QLED Display and Intel Core i7 Processor | 8GB Memory | 512GB SSD | Long Battery Life and Windows 10 Operating System | (NP950XCJ-K01US),&1291,review9.csv
45,45,Josh,"October 15, 2020",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for basic gaming!,"Pros:+ Extremely lightweight and quiet.+ Supports external graphics (eGPU) via Thunderbolt 3, meaning you have the ability to play modern games (but this will cost $300+ extra).+ Screen is GORGEOUS. Super bright, colorful, and everything you would expect from a Samsung display.+ Battery life is outstanding, but definitely activate battery saver mode and charge to 100% if you plan to be out all day.+ Headphone jack!+ Processor is plenty powerful to even do video editing/rendering with 1080p source material.+ Keyboard/trackpad is a joy to use and type on.Cons:- Track pad charging is finnicky and mostly a gimmick, but could come in handy if you forgot your cable somewhere.- No upgradeability options for the 13"". I would only recommend the 15"" because you can expand RAM/storage down the road.- Upgrading the 15"" is extremely challenging because of the small screws. I stripped mine and had to take it to a computer shop to replace them.- Weak sound speakers. Prepare to use headphones or listen in a quiet place.- No graphics card on the North American version. Asian version gets the MX250 GPU, which would have been nice to have that option.Beware: the Ion does not come with a dedicated graphics card. The onboard graphics (part of the CPU) is, however, fully capable of playing simple or older games (think PS2 or PS3/Xbox 360 era). I am able to play Rainbow Six Vegas 2 at max resolution (1080p) and medium settings at ~30 fps.However, if you want to play anything more recent or intense (like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare), you'll need to get an eGPU, which works well using the Thunderbolt 3 connection. It is an extra thing to carry around when traveling, but at least you have the option to carry/travel light, then play some great games when you are home.I recommend the 15"" version because it gives you the option to increase its internal storage/RAM. The 512 GB SSD goes very quickly. RAM is also very cheap these days, and you can literally double the RAM for only $30. However, if you have no desire to do much beyond watching video, writing e-mail, using Microsoft Office Suite, etc, the 13"" is plenty capable.Final thoughts: I have been a long-time Samsung fan, and I continue to be after buying the 15"" Ion. Any complaints I have are extremely minor and have a way of getting around them. I sold my 2015 desktop computer that I purchased for about the same price, and I wish I started getting into modern laptops sooner. The solid state storage is game-changing, and the laptop is plenty powerful enough to game if you buy an eGPU (I got the Sonnet Breakaway Puck RX 560, which is decent but I plan to upgrade that).Hopes for Samsung to improve the Ion 2.0: advertise it, add customizability options for North America, and include a dedicated GPU. Even if they change nothing else, I would be plenty happy.9/10 :-)",Samsung Galaxy Book Ion 15.6” Laptop| QLED Display and Intel Core i7 Processor | 8GB Memory | 512GB SSD | Long Battery Life and Windows 10 Operating System | (NP950XCJ-K01US),&1291,review9.csv

47,47,Vedran Simic,"June 18, 2020",4.0 out of 5 stars,Battery life is a lie,"First thing, please do not purchase from Amazon due to price being $200 more then what the item retails at. Bought mine from brick and mortar store for under $1000.Second, the battery that it has advertised as up to 22 hours is a joke. The unit cannot get more than 5-8 hours of conventional use. I do not know what they used to determine the battery life but do not rely on this at all. Performance is okay, even for an i7, it is struggling against the Ryzen 5 4600U processor. Reason how I know is I actually have the ryzen machine and it is doing laps around this machine.Screen does look good. Sometimes too good. Samsung is always known to over saturate the displays on anything they make.  Speakers on the other hand are sort of...mediocre at best. At max volume, the sound sort of sounds hallow, not full and rich. Even though they state that it has been tuned by AKG, this speakers are terrible. I honestly cannot recommend this laptop.",Samsung Galaxy Book Ion 15.6” Laptop| QLED Display and Intel Core i7 Processor | 8GB Memory | 512GB SSD | Long Battery Life and Windows 10 Operating System | (NP950XCJ-K01US),&1291,review9.csv

Replaced another Samsung (Series 9) ultra light, but this one is even lighter (just a smidge over 2 pounds).Extremely fast too!  I love booting up from scratch in seconds and almost instantly from sleep.  Fingerprint reader works very well, and adds a nice level of security.The keyboard seems slightly wider than my series 9, which takes a bit of getting used to.

I get all my texts, calls ect right on my computer and it is super easy to drag and drop pictures ect on here.I would say to get you additional USB 2 to USB C adapters since there are no old school USB 2.0 ports.But if you are on the fence, get this one!",Samsung Galaxy Book Ion 15.6” Laptop| QLED Display and Intel Core i7 Processor | 8GB Memory | 512GB SSD | Long Battery Life and Windows 10 Operating System | (NP950XCJ-K01US),&1291,review9.csv
