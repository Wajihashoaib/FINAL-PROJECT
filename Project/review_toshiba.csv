I received it in Panama in only 1 week,"I bought this computer for a young man who is going to school to become an architect.  He needed a high performance computer and the Dynabook fit the bill.  I always buy  a Toshiba and was surprised to see that Toshba had sold away their pc business.  I suspect Toshiba corporation still owns this division and just spun it off under a holding company.  I have not had time to checkout why they did this, but I will.  Also this particular computer has a DVD drive which are being phased out in favor of the Mp3or 4 players to USB ports.  I am 74 and in the old days 80's/90's I was consider a computer geek.  but once I retired in my 50's, I stopped keeping up with the new technology and was just enjoying life.","Dynabook Toshiba Satellite Pro L50-G Business Computer, 15.6"" FHD Laptop, Intel Quard-Core i7-10510U, 64GB DDR4 RAM, 2TB PCIe SSD, GeForce MX250 2GB, Bluetooth, WiFi, Webcam, Type-C, Windows 10 Pro","$2,399.00",review12.csv

Our last Toshiba Satellite lasted over 10 years.  After an upgrade to the hard drive and ram, it is still going strong.  When searching for the specific laptop we wanted, we detailed TOUCH SCREEN, BACK-LIT KEYBOARD, TOSHIBA LAPTOP, and the RAM/HD we wanted.The Tecra quickly came up.  We bought it for $1,300 with a massive hard drive and 32G Ram.  While the laptop itself is solid and on fire, there is NO BACK-LIT KEYBOARD and NO TOUCH SCREEN.  After this massive disappointment, we decided to purchase a touch screen monitor and a back-lit keyboard.Now, basically, our would-be great laptop is a great desktop.Be careful in your searches, because they will leave out the things that are the most important to you.","Dynabook Toshiba Satellite Pro L50-G Business Computer, 15.6"" FHD Laptop, Intel Quard-Core i7-10510U, 64GB DDR4 RAM, 2TB PCIe SSD, GeForce MX250 2GB, Bluetooth, WiFi, Webcam, Type-C, Windows 10 Pro","$2,399.00",review12.csv

My old laptop lasted eight years without a glitch, though it's finally starting to fail. I wanted another Toshiba, though I didn't realize that Toshiba had been sold to Spark in 2018—hence the Dynabook. Once I got over my disappointment, I was very impressed by the quality of the monitor. It is sharp and brilliant. The keyboard is full sized, though the number buttons are a little narrower. The keys are all in the same place and you can click anywhere on the keypad to ""enter"". For some reason, the place where I put my hands is more comfortable than I am used to. Happily, it still contains a DVD player. It has 3 regular USB ports and one USB-C connector, only one jack for sound (when I plugged in my speakers it deactivated the microphone), the HDMI and Cat-5 connector.

On my list were the following...Intel I(3,5, or 7) processor at least 8 GB RAM, 14 - 15"" screen with at least 1920x1080 resolution, SSD (none of this hybrid nonsense and as far as I'm concerned the only reason laptops are coming with things like 54000 RPM drives, and wireless n, is to dump and overstock of now obsolete hardware). Anyway back to the list, a backlit keyboard, dual band wireless, touch screen, tablet capability (either flipping or detaching), light weight, good battery life, and the big kicker I didn't want to pay over $700 (really $500 or $600 was the sweet price). I had been on the lookout for many months maybe even over a year, and there were always a couple features missing or the price was extremely high (or more often both features missing like SSD and higher price). When this laptop finally came across my path it was on slickdeals posted for adorama at $699. It was my wife's bday and I didn't have the funds, but I keep searching for the model # to see if any other deals would come up while I found the money. Then a refurb shows up on amazon for $550 (bonus was a year free interest on my amazon card). Everything on my list was met or exceeded (best processor, more memory, wireless AC, very good reviews, just an amazing combination of hardware. Now I could remove a star for Windows 8.1 but will let that slide as 10 for free will be out soon. This laptop will boot from off in 4 seconds, that's really 4 seconds and you can start working, it's completely ready (I have tweaked it a little and removed some pre installed software), Even though refurb the one I got was indistinguishable from new and has no issues whatsoever, wifi is perfect (I saw some complain about that), the speed and performance of this laptop is extraordinary for day to day tasks. It's not being used for gaming so any video card limitations are no issue. Toshiba did a great job here and I wish more companies would package desirable hardware and not just obsolete junk they need to dump off on unknowing consumers. If they had more stars I'd give them. BRAVO Toshiba!!!!!To note: Reason from going from 5 stars to 3. About 8 months later (5 outside the refurb warranty) our touchpad mouse broke. While I wouldn't use a touchpad my wife couldn't live without it. I got a replacement on ebay for $12 and installed it easily in about 45 min. This may have been a bigger problem for folks that don't know how to repair laptops. I'm still giving it 5 stars for super performance and a minor low cost problem but others should take note this is not  the only mouse failure reported they are common. About 2 years later the keyboard has keys falling off and intermittently not working. the LCD display is leaking or something on the bottom so it is deteriorating (this may be form being bumped but there is no visual damage) Overall I reduced the rating to 3 stars because I've had too many issues with a laptop that rarely leaves the house. Still a powerful beast but seemingly a little fragile or not built as well as some other name brands","Toshiba Flagship 2-in-1 Convertible Tablet UltraBook 15.6"" Touchscreen Laptop P55W-B5318 - Intel Core i7-4510U - 12GB DDR3L Ram Memory - 256GB SSD Solid State Drive Satin Gold",$449.00,reviews10.csv
1,1,mariolina,"December 31, 2016",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Defective keyboard, long wait for repairs, cosmetic damage by repair shop - Would NOT buy again","I chose this laptop for its great specs (at the time I bought it) -- a large screen, convertible format, USB 3.0 drives, a solid state drive, and so forth. At the time, there were virtually no reviews because it was brand new to the market. I had been signifcantly underemployed and even unemployed during the Great Recesssion and I've have been playing catch-up ever since, so this notebook was a significant expense for me, but I had to buy one because I had enrolled in a programming course. Unfortunately, I soon realized that the keyboard was defective, and I had to send it back to be repaired. The repair took over two months, so I wasn't able to use it for my course. I did manage to borrow a friend's underpowered laptop, but it was a huge inconvenience for both of us. When I finally got my repaired computer back, I immediately saw that the repair center had damaged the case. The damage was cosmetic, so I reluctantly let it go because I had already inconvenienced my friend enough. However, after skimping, saving, and waiting for something as long as I have for this, and even breaking my budget, and then not being able to use it for its primary purpose, the scratches just added insult to injury. The rule for buying high tech is to buy it when you need it, never in advance, because the capabilies will increase and the prices will drop dramatically. I feel cheated because I didn't get to use this for the purpose I bought it for when I needed it, and during the over two months of downtime while I waited for it to be repaired, better options became available at lower prices. I would NEVER had bought a laptop over two months before I planned to use it, but that's what happened. Not to mention that when you buy something new, especially when you are paying more than the average cost for that item, you deserve to receive something in pristine, perfect, new condition, not scratched up, as this was when I finally was able to use it.This has to rank as one of the very worst shopping experiences in my life.Final summary: After getting the defective keyboard fixed, this turned out to be a pretty nice computer, and I would have ranked it higher if it had worked as it should have out of the box, and if Toshiba's customer server and repair had been acceptable. More than anything -- features, speed, portability, and other factors, computers need to be reliable.","Toshiba Flagship 2-in-1 Convertible Tablet UltraBook 15.6"" Touchscreen Laptop P55W-B5318 - Intel Core i7-4510U - 12GB DDR3L Ram Memory - 256GB SSD Solid State Drive Satin Gold",$449.00,reviews10.csv
2,2,Southern Gal,"January 4, 2016",5.0 out of 5 stars,Toshiba 2-in-i Convertible Tablet UltraBook rocks!,"This is my third Toshiba in a row, and once again I am not disappointed. However, this is my first experience with both a touch screen and a tablet, and having both in a laptop is pure heaven! I love the size, the [familiar-to-me] keyboard layout, the ease of operation, the perfect touch of the keyboard keys, the quick response of the touch pad, and the ease and convenience of the touch screen that operates on both the laptop and the tablet. And the 360 degree flip-and-fold feature provides five convenient modes: laptop, audience, presentation, tabletop and tablet. Awesome!  A couple of minor issues for me are the USB port on the left side is very close to the outlet for the power cord and it's a bit tight, and the cord plug itself sometimes comes loose and falls out on its own accord. I don't know why that is but I just put it back in. Neither of these is a big issue for me, just room for a little improvement in future models. Also, this my first laptop without an optical drive but I purchased an external drive for about $20 that works fine and meets my need. While it's true an internal drive is more convenient if you use it a lot like I do, it's really not a big deal to attach a USB drive that you can easily take with you. Buy one that is powered by USB and let the laptop run it without the need for electricity.Everything works well; the memory card reader is on the left, beside the USB port; two more USB and a HDMI port are on the right. The small power button is also on the left side. I overlooked this when I first got the laptop and asked for help from the community to find it. I wear glasses and it's pretty small and almost flush with the laptop frame so I missed it. Pardon my red face.  The screen resolution is bright and beautiful while the built in Harman/Kardon speakers provide good sound. The keyboard, complete with numeric keyboard on the right side, is laid out well for comfort and functionality. The backlight is the way to go: my last Toshiba had a backlight, and I will never again buy a laptop or computer keyboard without one. Again, I wear glasses and this is tremendously helpful to my vision as well as using the keyboard in poorly lit situations or in a bedroom, etc.  For some who have dissed Toshiba as ""junk"" I would disagree. I've had two Toshiba laptops in the past that have been real work horses and they were very heavily used. Both of them still work although memory problems [I have that too!], and generally outdated technology forced me to replace them. Other that that, I never had a problem or complaint with either of them. I had total confidence buying this Toshiba, and searched for Toshiba laptops exclusively in fact.  In summary, aside from the minor issues scarcely worth mentioning, I am extremely happy with this wonderful, lightweight Toshiba 2-in1, and I look forward to it giving me trouble free service for many years. So buy it and enjoy.","Toshiba Flagship 2-in-1 Convertible Tablet UltraBook 15.6"" Touchscreen Laptop P55W-B5318 - Intel Core i7-4510U - 12GB DDR3L Ram Memory - 256GB SSD Solid State Drive Satin Gold",$449.00,reviews10.csv
3,3,Deborah L,"July 1, 2016",2.0 out of 5 stars,TOSHIBA 2 in 1 CONVERTIBLE TABLET DYING IN LESS THAN A YEAR,"I love the style of it. And it's heavy but I expected that because it's big. But I've only had it 1 year and 2 months and there are cracks in the bottom of the casing ON BOTH SIDES, right at the corners, where the sides of the bottom cover leaves the keyboard to leave a space for the USB ports on one side and miscellaneous ports on the other side. This is a CLEAR design flaw.  And now one of the control keys doesn't work. Ridiculous.I was so happy to get this as it looked like I was finally going to have a Toshiba where the hinges at the bottom of the screen didn't wear out LONG BEFORE the hard drive did. Even if that turns out to be true, I have a bigger problem. I'm getting blue screen crashes. The first one happened 2 months ago, maybe less. The computer started right back up and apologized for the error, so it didn't LOOK LIKE the blue screen crashes of old -- that signal that the hard drive is dying -- but now I'm not so sure.I think I probably should have contacted Toshiba when it first happened and got a replacement, because yesterday it happened again -- another blue screen memory error. The computer said it was going to restart after it reported something to microsoft, but it didn't. I pressed the start button and it restarted without any problems but I'm nervous I spent the best part of $1000 on fire buying this thing.If it goes in less than 2 to 3 years, I'm done with Toshiba. I put up with the cheap cases because the hard drives didn't die in the old laptops I had. I even spilled tea into one of them TWICE, it kept running. The thing that made me get rid of it was the hinge on the screen falling to pieces, just like the one before it, and the one before that.If this hard drive doesn't last, I'm done. I'm going to write to Toshiba. If they attempt to ""make me whole,"" as they say I'll write another update.","Toshiba Flagship 2-in-1 Convertible Tablet UltraBook 15.6"" Touchscreen Laptop P55W-B5318 - Intel Core i7-4510U - 12GB DDR3L Ram Memory - 256GB SSD Solid State Drive Satin Gold",$449.00,reviews10.csv
4,4,Crimsoncascade,"June 17, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great value, huge high def tablet, silent speedy laptop","I was extremely surprised by the value of this laptop.  I bought refurbished here on Amazon from Intent -- the item looks brand new and was insanely cheap.  First off, the laptop is completely silent.  No fan, no harddrive. Complete silence.  Second, I've been getting battery life around 10 hours, which has changed my life.  Third, while  the wifi reception is a bit poor [it doesn't reach into rooms that my other laptops will still get a signal in], I was pleasantly surprised by much better transfer rates than my other (recent model) laptops, so that is a tradeoff I'll take.  Third, ssd drive means immediate startup and other kinds of speed.  When I was transferring files using a 16gig USB stick from my last Toshiba (only a year old), my old Toshiba would take something like 10 minutes to copy the files onto the stick, while this Toshiba would transfer from the stick in a minute or two.  So I find everything VERY FAST.  Fourth, for whatever reason, this laptop worked out of the box seemlessly with my NAS.  Finally, I have various 7 and 8 inch Kindle Fire's, but when you fold this screen back, you have a whopping 15.6"" High Def Tablet.  I wasn't really expecting to enjoy it that much, since I use it mostly as a laptop.  I'll tell you that when I folded it back in a room of people on their phones and Ipads and Kindles, and I started looking through my photos and using an app or two, every eye in the room was on me, asking what I was using.  The only negative I have found is that because it's a fully high def screen, the default size of text etc. is pretty small, and my eyes aren't what they used to be.  So I have to pinch and zoom a bit to make webpages bigger, but that's what a fully hi def screen means.  What perks aren't to like?  Backlit keyboard, two button trackpad, super thin and sleek, etc.  It seems to have the features and performance of nearly identical laptops twice the price.","Toshiba Flagship 2-in-1 Convertible Tablet UltraBook 15.6"" Touchscreen Laptop P55W-B5318 - Intel Core i7-4510U - 12GB DDR3L Ram Memory - 256GB SSD Solid State Drive Satin Gold",$449.00,reviews10.csv
5,5,J. Starns,"October 18, 2016",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Worked great for three months, now it's a hunk of junk.","I purchased this laptop for work.  It worked super fast for the first few months.  Lightning fast.  Then about the 6 month mark, it started giving me warnings about the cooling system. I googled all the workarounds, tried a ton of things to help this error message go away. Shortly after that the fan would start up and be super loud.  Like a weed wacker outside buzzing.  I took it to a work meeting and people actually stared at me my laptop was so loud.  This is my first laptop, so I thought they just ""do"" that.  It would work great if I was on a remote server, but the literal second I went on line, just one page mind you, Facebook.  I wasn't gaming or anything, and the fan would sound like the machine was going to explode.  Now conveniently just after the 1 year warranty mark, the cooling warning system pops up and the fan won't even turn on.  Sometimes I can knock gently and it will slowly whirl on.  Some times prayer works, sometimes it just won't come on at all.  Matter of fact I am writing this review on my home computer and not my laptop, because it won't stay on long enough for me to leave a review.  It stays on for two minutes at a time. Very sad about this purchase.  I do not have $900 more dollars to buy a lap top every year.  It seems this particular laptop is basically disposable, as they did not build it to last past it's warranty.  Be warned, you will be disappointed in this lap top.  It will fail you when you need it most.  If I can save just one person from the heartache of buying this computer, I have done my job.

6,6,DaveG,"December 30, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,Seems to Be the Beast People Say It Is,"Starting Out Well.  Others said it was powerful and it is not disappointing.  For comparison, I bought a high end desktop last year and had installed a large SSD on that and lots of RAM (and upgraded my download speed to 175 MB/s and a new 5G modem off ethernet) have been merrily enjoying that for some time.  This thing holds it's own in comparison, running with the same modem and wireless.  I run some pretty hefty stuff  - running VPN to work, graphics, 3D modelling, and some minor developing and I'm never waiting around for either machine.  I even installed Ubuntu in VirtualBox to run alongside it and am able to carve off 3 processors and 4 GB RAM to devote to that and don't notice any slowdown.  That's the positive side of this thing and it does not disappoint.I noticed that the speakers are half decent.  Though I haven't had much experience with it.The downsides have been pretty minor.  Toshiba installed a bunch of bloatware that was actually raising flags with the anti-malware software I normally install first thing.  It takes a half hour or so to clean up the machine.  I haven't quite got the hang of the screen orientation yet.  Sometimes I pick the thing up and it flips upside down virtually and takes a half minute to get its balance back.  The keyboard has different switches embedded in the normal key set to turn some things off so you can flip the screen into tablet mode and set it down on the keyboard.  So mostly these downsides are features not bugs.  I am hard pressed to complain about this and I'm difficult to please with my computers.We'll see how this fares with time.

I'd highly recommend this laptop solely for the speaker quality,the display is amazing as it is Full HD (1920x1080),and has a perfectly lit back light.I guess my only complaint would be the bezels of the computer.When you try to open it, you have to push somewhat hard on the bezel of the display on top, meaning you will get hard-pressed fingerprint spots in that area; thought it could just be easily wiped off even with your shirt... just thought I'd point that out.But this laptop is the most fantastic lapto-... comput-..... electronic device I have ever purchased.Yes...

Only downsides so far are that the trackpad doesn't respond quickly sometimes and its a little heavy to be used as a tablet.

I bought this as an open box item from Amazon Warehouse and it blew away the Dell XPS that i had previously owned.  I use my computer all day everyday for work and transport it around on a regular basis.  The weight of the laptop is excellent compared to typical laptops of this size. It has a very thin form and fits well into my carry bag.  The touchscreen is very responsive and folding the screen back into tablet form works great and snaps into place nicely.  The keys have a nice response to them and the palm pad area is large and works well for people with bigger hands.

Got through that and then used Macrium Reflect (free version) to create the bootable USB drive and for weekly backups (we always think it will never happen to us and then one day it did years ago; learned my lesson!).

Hands down, the best laptop I have ever owned - and I have owned many!  Then.......the ""A"" key randomly stopped working. I would have to strike it several times and then it would finally work. Then the ""N"" key, followed by the Shift, Enter, and B keys.....intermittently they work just fine, but randomly they stop working entirely. What was a minor annoyance soon became a HUGE problem!!! What good is a laptop if the keyboard literally doesn't work??  I couldn't even unlock the thing because my password contained an ""N"" and I could not type an ""N"" with the defective keyboard.  I went online and read every article from every forum I could find and what I found is that this is not an isolated incident.  Many others have had this same problem. What disturbs me and why I am sending this laptop back is that there is no fix for this problem and nobody really knows if the problem is with the hardware, software, or both.

Within a few months of purchase (Aug 2015), the keyboard stopped working. This was covered by the warranty, but I was still out the shipping cost plus the time it took to ship the laptop to and from Toshiba's repair center. Otherwise, it has worked more or less smoothly. However, it has now been seven months, and the bottom corner of the screen is coming apart at the seam. I have barely taken the laptop out of my house, and so this damage has occurred through the normal process of opening and closing the screen. When I called Toshiba, I was told that this qualified as ""physical damage"", and thus would not be covered by the warranty (and is my responsibility to have repaired at my expense). I feel that this is unacceptable, especially for a unit that is advertised as a ""2-in-1 Convertible Tablet Ultrabook"".

0,0,Jamie,"December 27, 2013",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just replaced my old macbook, great for daily use & handles the adobe suite like a pro","I have now owned this computer for over six months and can honestly saw what a great, portable and powerful product this device is. It's great for those who want a tablet but don't want the limited operating system. Here you get a full-functioning laptop with a decent sized touch screen (with amazing resolution) that folds down. It is bulky if you're comparing it to a tablet - but considering you're getting a very solid and full-functioning device, I really have no complaints and it's heaps lighter than my old macbook from 5 years ago. And considering it's capabilities, the price is very reasonable.My biggest fear with this device was the exposed screen, but I have no scratches or any sort of wear on the screen and it's super easy to clean. I just use my glasses cloth every couple weeks - as long as your fingers aren't greasy or anything from food or lotion, fingerprints are never really an issue. Back in summer I found the glare on the screen hard to use the computer sometimes in the bright sun, but nothing a shady spot didn't solve!I'll admit, I was skeptical of Windows 8 when it first came out, but I was fortunate enough to have a legit Microsoft employee show me all the features and how to utilize the operating the tile screen. I still am on the desktop 80% of the time, but there are some neat apps and shortcuts you can create on the desktop. It's also pretty fun to customize. But I really have grown to like Windows 8 (so long as you have a touch screen!). I'd recommend just watching some free demo videos and you'll be set. I really love splitting the screen between apps and using the sides to swipe in different functions and menus. It really becomes habitual once you get use to it and now I even go nuts when I'm not on a touch screen!Also, I haven't contracted a single viruses so far and took off Norton first thing (Norton really sucks up a lot of your computers resources, I suggest most people should just thoroughly uninstall it. Though they don't make it easy.) - and that's with being an avid download-er. I actually had a really annoying virus on my mac before that was horrendous to remove, so please don't fall for that myth that only PC's get viruses!The only real downsides I've encountered,-the hard drive has very limited space for my photography & design needs, but I just bought a 1tb passport hard drive with USB3 and I'm set. It is solid state, which really helps make the computer faster and more responsive, but the lack of internal space does bum me out sometimes.-Thought it's not a big deal for me, I know some people like to carry extra batteries and change them if they can't plug in their device. This has a relatively lower batter for today's standards (I can still get a good 4-5+ hours,even while skyping & editing photos) and doesn't allow you to remove your battery. Again, probably not a huge deal for most people, but just a warning to those who do like having back-up batteries.-The only thing my old macbook has going against this device it it's ability to pick up weaker WiFi signals. While it's often not a huge problem, if you're in a weaker WiFi zone, this computer will not want to connect sometimes. Once there is a connection though, it's great. I've mostly only encountered this while trying to access open networks while not in their respected buildings. I probably wouldn't consider this a huge deal, though I've noticed my mac picks up those signals without trouble, but the internet itself does tend to lag a lot.Overall though, I'm soon going back to school and I know I found the perfect device to do my work on and records lectures with (there's two cameras! One facing you and the other on the back of the screen). I carry my computer with me everywhere, so the portability of this device is great. I've had no problems with hardware or software malfunctioning. It's fast, very responsive and surprisingly powerful for it's tiny size! It also has a very slick design that is stunning and tough!I would definitely recommend it for someone wanting a portable, multipurpose device that's got the latest technology while still spending less than a mac! I was initially going to buy a macbook pro but just couldn't make it past the checkout with that price, ultimately I took the lunge and bought this. Never regretted it once.

1,1,Amazon Customer,"July 26, 2013",5.0 out of 5 stars,Exactly what we were looking for,"Perfect form factor for my wife and I.For the record, I am a fan of Windows 8.  I upgraded my desktop to Windows 8 and had no issues using it.  After using Windows 8 with this machine, I like it even better.  Using this in tablet, laptop and tablet/laptop mode has been a pleasure.I looked and read about many of the new Windows 8 hybrids/tablets.  I really wanted to like the other options, but needed the laptop mode that this unit provides and didn't want to spend north of $1K to meet our needs.  I came across this unit at a local store and was marked (supposedly by mistake) as a similar price as the one on Amazon, but they didn't want to honor their price so I bought it here.I bought this machine primarily for my wife to replace my old HP laptop that died.  I set the machine up using only the touchscreen...didn't even slide out the keyboard.  My wife loves it and I even caught myself picking it up and using it more than her at first.Pros:- Has SSD hard drive.  FAST.  Starts up, sleeps, resumes, starts applications faster than my beast desktop (going to upgrade that to a SSD!)- Cool.  It doesn't get very hot like normal laptops with traditional hard drives (could be the integrated video card as well)- Small and light enough to be portable, yet large enough that we aren't squinting at the screen and wishing for a larger screen.- Battery life.  This machine seems to last a good 4+ hours...haven't consistently timed it, but I don't feel we have to look for the power chord all of the time.  We are able to use the machine, put it to sleep and use it for a couple of days.- Keyboard is backlit- Touchscreen is accurate.  I tried a few touchscreens and walked away from them after just a minute or two because of how frustrating they were.  This one just works.- It has a mouse touchpad that recognizes some gestures...I only played with the pinch zoom in/out so far and just learned that one while writing this review...Give me a break, this is primarily my wife's machine.Cons:- If this is you only machine of the house, the hard drive size in this unit might not be big enough (128 GB).  If you need to develop and need to install a lot of software, this drive would fill up fast.  Also, if you plan on putting your media on this machine, it will definitely fill up fast.- Video Card is probably the minimum you would want in a new machine.  I haven't noticed any particular issue with it, but spec wise it is low- The screen is always visible/exposed (It is Gorilla glass though).  If you need a hybrid that hides the screen when not in use, this is not your machine.- There is no CD/DVD drive...but do you really need one anymore?Overall, just a great machine",Toshiba Satellite U925T-S2120 12.5-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Ultrabook (Midnight Brown in Soft Touch Body),$675.00,reviews11.csv
2,2,ECP,"April 25, 2013",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Functionally suits my purposes, so far...","Update 3/14/15: Reading the increasing number of 1-star reviews mentioning touchscreen and screen troubles and outages from ribbon failure or other causes (known and unknown) I feel very lucky now because mine continues to work so well. The included instructions urged slow, careful sliding on the hinge, I recall, and I will continue to change screen positions very slowly and gently, since this design apparently leaves vulnerabilities--or maybe Toshiba's quality-control is spotty as other suggest--or both. But I'm still very happy with mine and it has functioned reliably and adequately, so far. This doesn't feel heavy to me at 3.2 pounds and the relatively short up-to-4-hours battery life (which I knew about before I purchased, so I didn't subtract stars) serves me okay because I'm rarely far from an outlet, but ultraportables are getting lighter and lasting longer and when I buy another I will seek longer battery life and lighter weight.  Those thin buttons on the side are easy for me to feel and operate without having to look and I've gotten used to the smaller, stiffer touchpad too (didn't even try to adjust the settings, just kept working, growing accustomed, but I understand it could frustrate).Original review: Yes, the Touchpad is stiff and the On/Off, Volume and Screen-rotation buttons (on the left side toward the back, as I face the laptop) are tiny, as a reviewer somewhere noted, but these minor inconveniences haven't slowed me down yet. So, I'm unlikely to push any of those buttons inadvertently and the pad works well enough alongside the Touchscreen, which is suitably sensitive.Yes, the Touchscreen is highly shiny and becomes ""fingerprinted""--of course it does--like most tablets I've seen. Wiping it clear (using a lint-free cloth designed to clean eyeglasses) is easy enough.And yes, as tablets go this is rather big and heavy--but it's less awkward than I expected. I hope to take it traveling often.Also, this aside: Yesterday, when I fired this up, was my first-ever hands-on whirl with Windows 8 and I was relieved to realize I could catch on, pretty much, within an hour, though I don't consider myself terribly-techy. The hybrid nature of this little critter and/or Windows 8 must/might be partially behind the double-keyboard effect that distracts occasionally (that I read about somewhere), but I know my confused input, hit-and-missing while learning the new OS and getting used to switching between tablet and laptop modes, caused this weirdness also. Anyway, it's no big deal for me--easy to fix and move on.Right away I found the hinge mechanism sturdy-enough-feeling and pleasantly-surprisingly easy to work during mode-switching.The device is too new for me to rate at 5 stars and this 4-star rating is provisional (I didn't subtract a star just for the slightly stiff Touchpad and buttons or glare or smudge-proneness or any weirdness I've mentioned because that's all minor, in my view, considering my purposes); I'm still exploring the features and testing; and I will update this review with further details, probably.UPDATE February 23, 2015: Finally, I've added the fifth star. I'm still very happy with this and no problems have cropped up thus far.",Toshiba Satellite U925T-S2120 12.5-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Ultrabook (Midnight Brown in Soft Touch Body),$675.00,reviews11.csv
3,3,Katy Dorfschmidt,"August 13, 2013",3.0 out of 5 stars,Still deciding,"I ordered this product on the eleventh of July, but didn't receive it until about the eighth of August - so I'm not quite ready for a full review...but here is what I think so far:The computer definitely takes some getting used to.  I was excited to get a machine with Windows 8.  I have a Windows phone and love the interface.  However, the interface on the computer is quite different.  I still haven't figured out several things.  Call me a dumb blonde, but I can't figure out simple things like how to close windows.  Not to mention the multiple hours it took me to figure out how to get to my desktop.  This really is a learning curve though, and I believe that as I learn, the Windows 8 interface could be fun to use.I have had some issues with programs that I typically use - for example, my epub and kindle readers that I use to read books I downloaded from sites such as Smashwords will not work on this computer.  The Kindle Cloud Reader doesn't seem to function the same, and the Kindle app won't import books from external sources as it did on my old machine which ran Windows 7.  This may just be something for me to figure out.I've also had issues getting multiple email addresses to work.  My phone has multiple email icons - one for my hotmail and one for my gmail.  I couldn't get that to work on this machine as it made me use an email address as a ""Microsoft"" email - so now my gmail won't work in an app.  Very confusing.  I ended up having to get a Gmail app through Pokki.  Again, I just need more time to fidget with things.A few other things I've noticed in the few hours I've spent dinking with the machine.  The touch pad is a little tricky to figure out.  Trying to learn how to right click is driving me nuts.  It's pretty touchy.  Also my screen is set to auto brightness, and it can never decide how bright it wants to be.  I know I could switch this feature off - but I like the concept of it.  It just seems to be strobe lighting - it can't find a happy brightness.I will definitely have more to report on after using the computer some more.  This is simply a preliminary review of my initial thoughts.",Toshiba Satellite U925T-S2120 12.5-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Ultrabook (Midnight Brown in Soft Touch Body),$675.00,reviews11.csv
4,4,Gary Watson,"December 12, 2013",5.0 out of 5 stars,Does exactly what I was looking for.,"With the myriad of pcs and laptops out there to choose from, deciding which one is good is based on what a person needs. I love this ultrabook. I tried using a tablet ( iPad and the Thrive) before and quickly discovered I'm not a total tablet-person. But, I like the convenience of using a tablet for some things. What I wanted was a combination of both: PC and tablet. I was looking for something I could use on the train during my commute to work without having to lug my 17"" laptop around. I wanted a unit that would be fast, with an Intel processor, large enough screen to make it easy to work on (most of my use is work related, not playing games or flipping around on the internet) with a full keyboard ANd one that would make using the keyboard easy, especially when sitting on the train. With so many options out there for how the keyboard is handled (clamshell, rotating board, softouch cover keyboard combination, etc.) I found this design to be the best. I like that the keyboard slides underneath the screen portion when using it as a tablet rather than having one that is a detachable  or swivel screen, or more so, one where the keyboard flips backward and remains exposed. Unlike some of the reviews I read elsewhere about this unit, the case design is really not an issue. The keyboard does slide out easily making it very easy to use on the train. I have a backlit keyboard on my 17"" laptop and this unit has the same feature. Makes a huge difference when working in low lit areas. The screen is sharp so working on a smaller screen is no problem. It starts up amazingly fast, making it even better to get work done quickly during a train ride. This wasn't intended to be my primary PC or to replace my 17"" laptop, but to be an efficient and lightweight companion to a from work. And, as much as I am a Toshiba fan, I strongly recommend this unit to anyone who has similar criteria in selecting a laptop/tablet combo unit. Less expensive than the Surface, and while some have cited the weight being a consideration, I don't find it to be clumsy or heavy at all. I actually prefer the shape and weight of this to the iPad. Feels much more substantial when using it as a tablet, and I can't stress enough how great it is to be able to switch to using the keyboard in laptop mode by doing nothing more than sliding out the keyboard. You won't go wrong with this unit.",Toshiba Satellite U925T-S2120 12.5-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Ultrabook (Midnight Brown in Soft Touch Body),$675.00,reviews11.csv
5,5,Amazon Customer,"June 1, 2013",5.0 out of 5 stars,Laptop is pretty neat,"As far as the laptop goes, I'm really impressed. It's built solid and I'm a fan of the laptop/tablet transformer thing. Backlit keyboard will come in handy I'm sure, and I'm well adjusted to the smaller size of the keyboard too. As far as Windows 8 goes, I wasn't a fan at first but it is growing on me. I don't do the social website stuff, but I'm always on Amazon, eBay, Netflix and stuff like that. The app screen is nice but takes getting acclimated too. But there is also the desktop mode that's easy to get to. I'm big on being able to manipulate my computer to get it how I want it, Win 8 doesn't make that simple but it is doable. I also bought this in anticipation of the Windows 8.1 update coming at the end of the year, so hopefully that will make Win 8 more enjoyable. This laptop is mainly for homework, e-mail, web surfing, and playing movies and it does all these things top notch.Update: 10 February 2014.So I'm about 8 months into the laptop and I was in love with it. I adjusted to the smaller keyboard and windows 8. I felt good about the touchscreen and everything. Then about 10 days ago, the screen would blank (like it just lost all power) when I pulled it into laptop mode. It was perfectly fine as a tablet. I could very slowly push it into laptop mode and it would stay on so I stopped shutting lid to avoid messing with it all the time. Closed it awhile ago to store it and that night the screen wouldn't come back on at all. Had to use hdmi port with my tv and a remote keyboard to work it. Talked with toshiba warranty and had to pay $25 for their shipping box (my choice but they ""Recommend"") so I have the best chance of repair. Depending how this goes will determine my loyalty to toshiba.

6,6,Keichii,"October 5, 2014",1.0 out of 5 stars,First and last Toshiba Product. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.,"Absolute garbage. I am deeply disappointed by the build quality of this device. I chose this over the much better Surface Pro 2 and realize I have made a grave mistake.The keyboard is the worst keyboard i've ever used in my life. The finicky keys do not always register a keystroke because the force from normal typing is not enough for the bottom of the key to touch the contacts. This is especially the case for the space key. There is very little surface force that is transferred to the contact so trying to press the space bar by the edges will simply not work sometimes. Touch typing is very difficult.The battery life is very mediocre. Normal browsing and light media playing gets me up to nearly three hours max. Charging is lengthy and frequent. The fan is very noisy and I cannot even watch videos at a public place without getting strange looks.However, even above this is has to be one of the worst design faults i've ever seen in a laptop. Had this not been an issue, I would've easily overlooked its minor inconveniences. When the computer is converted to tablet mode, the top screen is pushed down and you pull it towards you to cover the keyboard. A small black ribbon is exposed to stress every time you do this. Over the course of a full year, this black ribbon has been slowly robbing my laptop of features. Most notably, after about three months, the touchscreen starting having problems with reactivity and sometimes didn't work at all. Five months in, the touchscreen failed to work at all. I decided to deal with it since I was in a computer-intensive class at the time and didn't have the time or money to get it repaired. Now about a few weeks ago, the integrated mic on the laptop had failed to work, albeit due to the same black ribbon. It does not work unless I angle it at a dangerous and awkward position.I have about a month left on my warranty. I have heard horror stories about particular customer service with this product and I hope I don't have to jump through too many hurdles to get this thing fixed.Three words. Do. Not. Buy.

From what I could see, convertibles almost always have some pretty big problems in their design.  Lenovo has the Yogabook, but it works by folding the screen all the way over so that the keyboard is exposed and upside down (they sell a case).  The guys at Best Buy says people are having a lot of problems with the hinges on the Dell.  On and on, you get the point.  This Toshiba is pretty sound in my opinion.  Some people aren't going to like that the screen stays exposed, but how is that any different from a tablet?  It has really good features for the money; it is quite noticeable in speed to have a steady state drive.  The technology also works as well as I think anything could work for Windows 8 at this point in Windows 8 development.  I like Windows 8, I don't understand the big knock on it, but maybe that's because having a convertible makes it so much easier to use.",Toshiba Satellite U925T-S2120 12.5-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Ultrabook (Midnight Brown in Soft Touch Body),$675.00,reviews11.csv

I also use an Anker 3.o USB docking station.  The entire system runs fast and smooth with two extra monitors (one being a flat screen TV).  Had no problems.

Occasionally, the touch screen would not work and I would have to restart. However, just around the 1 year mark, the computer developed Alzheimer's disease and began to forget parts of itself. It started by forgetting that it had speakers and a camera...but only in laptop mode, When you slid the screen closed,the devices appeared again. Then it forgot the touchscreen entirely in both tablet and laptop mode. Essentially, I had a regular laptop computer, which was okay. Toshiba was absolutely no help in trying to resolve the issues and had no explanation for why drivers worked in one mode and not the other. I eventually did a hard reset and the computer's performance tanked. The battery, after 1.5 years, lasted about 1 hour.Now I had a desktop computer. But I still had use for that. Today, however, after less than 2 years, the screen stopped working at all in laptop mode (but still works in tablet mode) and the keyboard doesn't work... since the touchscreen is gone, I have no input method, so this is now a big piece of garbage that I can't even give away because I can't get my personal information off of it.

I bought this in the beginning of Sept 2014. Now, March 2015, the screen will not even turn on. Right in the middle of filing my taxes. Spent too long reading through some paperwork and the screen went to sleep. Will not wake up again. Let the battery die, charged it, and tried again. Nothing.

It worked well enough to be occasionally useful for a while though. Over time, with windows upgrades and such, the wifi became next to useless and I was getting ready to chuck it. So what the heck, I loaded Ubuntu. It was 10 times better right from the start. Wifi went from iffy on loading google's start page to streaming video with no trouble. I started using it constantly. Sadly, after a few months of this actual use, the display would stop working when I switched from tablet to laptop. A little jiggling seemed to fix it for a while (clearly some sort of switch inside was starting to fail). Now it doesn't work ever, no matter what position.

When I called the first customer support number 1-800-513-9578 FREE I spoke with a male representative who was very rude on the phone. He said I quote "" I am not asking you, I am telling you there is a physical damage to the device"" and proceeded to insinuate that the device was dropped or that something heavy was placed on the top of it, going as far as telling me that there is a crack in the screen.1. The screen is not cracked !2. The device was not dropped !3. There was never put anything heavy on the top of the device !4. The lap top remains inside the house on the desk for 98% of the time and few times that it was taken out, it securely traveled inside a bag.5.

Amazon shipped it in 2 days, perfectly as usual.  Out of the box,  I set it up following the quick start guide and signed in only to see a blank gray screen.  I called Toshiba and could tell by their attitude they could care less and wanted me to pay for support.  Finally, after several on/off and reboots, it worked. Oh, and you cannot take the battery out of this computer, its locked inside.  When the screen came up I saw that Windows 8 is bizarre.  Microsoft is trying to be like Apple but it is not working for them.  Read about it before you get a laptop with it.  I have a MAC and I was used to Windows Vista.  Windows 8 is nothing like either of them.  I felt lost and although I am not an IT person, I can usually find my way around a computer.  So,  after this first night I thought more about it and called Amazon the next day for a return.  It was no problem to send it back.  I ended up getting a laptop with Windows 7.

0,0,LimonKay,"June 19, 2016",4.0 out of 5 stars,Upgrading from a previous Toshiba Satellite.,"After using this laptop for about two weeks now I feel confident in making a detailed summary.To start off, I'm someone who has been using another Toshiba Satellite (The p845t-s305) prior to this for 4 years and I've loved it dearly - it was the first laptop I purchased with my own money while working for it in high school. My previous one had a very nice silver finish that gave it a premium feel to it with lovely clear crisp Harman Kardon speakers.As for this laptop, I'm a full-time college student and an occasional gamer so I'm trying to supplement both when I purchased this.The laptop itself is pretty bulky, (6.2 lbs) can be a nuisance to hold onto if you're constantly walking through campus or work, also the 15.6"" screen is quite large, too large in fact to fit onto most university desks snug, if you're not careful you might actually drop it.The Harman Kardon speakers are not impressive at all, the sound is clear and crisp but not loud enough to actually give you a theater-like feel on a 4k display. My previous Toshiba Satellite speakers (also Harman Kardon) despite being a laptop $200 cheaper, they were so much louder.Although the 4k display is quite impressive, keep in mind MANY applications, programs, software haven't been integrated to work with 4k resolution as of date, so if you're like me you'll find playing some video games, and unbranded applications may be hard to look at as the text and windows may come out huge.The feel of the device is pretty cheap and the finish is nowhere near high quality, if I had to guess the price of this laptop just from appearances only without knowing a single spec of it, I'd say it's roughly something you'd find on the clearance aisle of Wal-Mart.Now with all the negatives aside, I am planning to keep this laptop as there as many positives to it as well.First and foremost, the back-lit keyboard is absolutely stunning. The battery life allows me to watch 2-3 episodes of Game of Thrones while waiting for my Japanese professor's lecture to end while she continues to rant about the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.The 12 GB ram is what really interested me in this laptop, that coupled with the intel i7 processor does make casual gaming a pleasant experience (League of Legends, Call of Duty run fine as long as you're not maxing out the settings, you'll get about 40-50 FPS). Don't expect this to run max settings without FPS drops and lags.The touchscreen is very responsive (the touchscreen on my previous laptop died after a year shortly so I'm still  a bit untrustworthy when it comes to this).Overall, for $700 you get a laptop with 12 GB ram, 1TB hard drive, intel i7 processor, a touchscreen with dual tablet mode on top of a 4k display resolution. Certainly beats your local BestBuy deal right?","Toshiba - Satellite Radius 2-in-1 15.6"" 4K Ultra HD Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 12GB Memory - 1TB Hard Drive - Carbon Gray",$649.00,reviews4.csv

When I received this, I swapped the HDD to a OCZ SSD with the help of a professional. It is super fast and was working fine other than getting blacked out from time to time and then coming back to its senses by it self. But since, last week, I have been experiencing some sort of issue with the touch screen. All of a sudden few touch points start to appear on the screen and at times those points closer to the task bar self click n apps and start to open them. And at times, those points make the cursor point to lock on one of those touch points. Also at times it makes the screen zoom in and zoom out when we try to move the cursor arrow or touch the screen. Some times when you touch one of them points and move it around the issue goes away. The same happens when the laptop is restarted. but again those points start to appear after some time. I don't know how to make this stop. I'm hoping a software update will fix this issue. if anyone else had the same experience or know anything about this issue, please let me know how to fix it. I have also attached some images and a video clip for you to understand the issue.

5,5,Savan,"August 26, 2016",3.0 out of 5 stars,display is nice but complicate to handle it,"Ok, I am going to try and explain to anyone who may be interested in buying this laptop why I feel it’s a good deal. Some of you really need to understand what a deal this is and why some people are having issues.I have had this laptop for a month now and I have not had any issues because, I knew what I was buying. You see, either a laptop or desktop will only be as fast as its slowest component. Yes, this thing has a great processor, lots of memory, great 4K graphics but, the hard drive is only a 5400 rpm. We’re talking 1990s technology, that’s why this laptop is so SLOW. Sure, it’s a lot of storage but, the factory installed hard drive, is not meant for speed. Also, seeing the hard drive is the slowest component, it can create some problems for all of the better components.Now, I went to Best Buy to check this thing out and theirs had the same specs overall except theirs had a 128gb ssd drive, it was fast but, they also wanted over $1, 000. So, I found this one on here for 7 something and figured by adding a faster ssd drive by myself, I could have a very nice 4K laptop for under $850. After I put in my new ssd drive, this thing flies, boots fast, files run fast, browsing is faster and no issues loading programs. Just remember to clone your factory drive to your new ssd before you swap them. Trust me I needed to load Office 365 before I got my new drive and it took 4hrs to get it loaded, what a pain.Plain English, you’re buying a formula one race car that has a lawn mower engine part that’s slowing it down, just upgrade the hard drive and own an awesome 4K laptop, It’s worth it. Even if you installed a 7200rpm drive in this laptop, it would still be worth it.","Toshiba - Satellite Radius 2-in-1 15.6"" 4K Ultra HD Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 12GB Memory - 1TB Hard Drive - Carbon Gray",$649.00,reviews4.csv

42,42,Amazon Customer,"February 9, 2016",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great laptop overall,"This laptop is probably a little more than what the average college or high school student might need. I have to do a lot of data entry for work so the number key pad is a necessity for me. I also do a lot of split screen work so it really helps having the 15.6” display. If you run a lot of programs at once, I’d recommend this laptop considering it has a 12GB ram. Ultimately, this laptop is a good fit for someone who does a lot of multitasking, runs a lot of programs at once, and wants a computer with full functionality and a crystal clear display.I rate this product a four out of five stars. It has a sleek design, feels light weight yet strong, and has by far the best display I have yet to see on a laptop. The touch screen is a nice feature plus being able to flip the screen all the way around. I also like that the keyboard automatically lights up when you start typing or press a key. It times out after a little bit to help conserve battery life. For me, the 12GB Ram is a big plus since I have a lot of programs running at the same time. I can’t imagine I’ll ever run out of memory either considering it has a terabyte to work with. The battery on this laptop seems about the same as others I have used. It usually lasts 4 to 6 hours, just depends what you’re doing.  I’d also recommend a warranty or accidental drop plan if available. The whole bottom is sealed up so no replacing batteries yourself on this one.When I first got the laptop a couple weeks ago I had problems with the display driver restarting quite a bit and the touch pad for the mouse would become unresponsive at times. The computer has downloaded numerous updates since I bought it and all the bugs seems to have worked out since then.If it wasn’t for the problems right away I’d give it five stars. It’s very frustrating paying a lot of money for what I consider an above-average quality laptop and having performance and operating issues from the get-go. Overall, the pros definitely out-weigh the cons and I would recommend this to a friend. Just be aware you might have to do some updates before you get to use your new laptop with its 4K high resolution touch-screen display.","Toshiba - Satellite Radius 2-in-1 15.6"" 4K Ultra HD Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 12GB Memory - 1TB Hard Drive - Carbon Gray",$649.00,reviews4.csv
43,43,John P. Cloninger,"November 1, 2016",4.0 out of 5 stars,and all has been great since. Just a warning about 4K displays,"I'm going to go four stars. I got a factory refurb from MicroCenter in Paterson, NJ, so I only paid $579. It was a huge risk, but it has worked out very well!It almost had to go back after a month because as I was removing all of that pre-installed software, and configuring all kinds of other stuff, I somehow corrupted Win10. But somehow I managed to get that fixed, and all has been great since.Just a warning about 4K displays...to get your settings to a tolerable compromise between icon size, font size, app size, etc. takes some time to fine tune. It can be very frustrating, especially when the OS was being fooled with a lot. I've landed at a happy medium.Battery life is awful. Know that in advance. That's probably what keeps me from saying five stars.I rarely use the tablet mode, but it's a nice to have in some situations. I think I've been in tablet mode around 2% of the time. I think of this more as a desktop replacement than a 2-in-1. I have a 10"" Verizon tablet, and so if I want a tablet experience, I go for that instead. Both fit in my gig bag just fine, so it's not a big deal.It seems like a risky purchase, but mine has been fantastic...I lost my last Toshiba after about six years of heavy use, including me replacing the HD once, the screen once, three keyboards, etc. That's not because the build quality was poor...it was that I smashed the screen, poured drinks into the KB, and just wanted a bigger HD. It's why I bought Toshiba again. I have the ability to do laptop surgery on a whim, so I'm not afraid.Recommended, but only for the right person.","Toshiba - Satellite Radius 2-in-1 15.6"" 4K Ultra HD Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 12GB Memory - 1TB Hard Drive - Carbon Gray",$649.00,reviews4.csv

0,0,angelflower,"November 16, 2015",3.0 out of 5 stars,So-so.  Not worth the price,I read the reviews before ordering this item and noted that reviewers mentioned two things that I found concerning:  the mouse pad issues and the sharp edge of the computer.  Let me start by saying I am a loyal customer to Toshiba.  This is my 3rd Toshiba laptop - I loved my last two.  This one feels cheaper and not up to the standards of my last Toshiba laptops.  The issue with the mouse is SUPER IRRITATING!  It's happened three times while just typing these few sentences.  Basically you are typing along and suddenly you realize that the cursor has jumped and highlighted what you are typing and it is deleted.  If you buy this computer you will use CTRL-Z a lot!  The sharp corners are annoying but you can learn to hold your hands differently and then you won't get cut.  If you rest your wrists on the edge of the laptop you will have a sharp red indent in your skin quickly.  The big thing on top of these has really nothing to do with the hardware - it's the software - windows 10.  It proved to be a lot of work to get this computer set up and remove all the crappy software it comes with (windows 10 related).  Would I buy this computer again?  No.  Should you?  Just be aware of the mouse and edge issues. I haven't loaded a lot of other software on this computer - it seems slow often and does freeze up a lot.  If you can wait - wait on a new laptop with windows 10 until they iron more kinks out.  So overall - this is just an okay laptop.  If I had pad half the price of what I paid I might be happier.  It's just not worth the price in my opinion.,"Toshiba Satellite S55-C5274 15.6 Inch Laptop (Intel Core i7-5500U 2.4 GHz, 12GB DDR3L-SDRAM, 1TB HDD, Windows 10 Home 64-bit)",$499.95l,reviews5.csv
1,1,Nicholas L.,"April 9, 2017",2.0 out of 5 stars,Underwhelming performance with overwhelming fan noise,"This is my 3rd toshiba laptop and I was a totally loyal toshiba customer until I bought this laptop. It is slower than my ~3 year old toshiba w/ an i3 that I bought at staples for $429. First thing I noticed was that this is absolutely the loudest laptop I've ever used! The fan roars like an airplane trying to take off, I tried adjusting power settings and following other solutions described by others who had the same problem, and it does help, but makes the computer slow. Next, within a few months, the audio jack stopped working and I had to buy a usb adapter. Yes, the sharp corners are not people friendly, If I lay in bed with the laptop propped up on my chest, I have to put a pillow on my chest so the laptop doesn't cut into my chest. This wasn't an issue with my previous laptops. The display is better than my old laptop, but I wouldn't say it's good by any stretch. Overall I'm pretty disappointed with this machine for the price, I thought I was getting an upgrade over my old laptop, but it just doesn't feel that way. I plan to dig into ways to optimize the performance of this laptop, but haven't gotten that far yet, and I don't think I should need to do that for something as expensive as this machine.","Toshiba Satellite S55-C5274 15.6 Inch Laptop (Intel Core i7-5500U 2.4 GHz, 12GB DDR3L-SDRAM, 1TB HDD, Windows 10 Home 64-bit)",$499.95l,reviews5.csv

26,26,JT,"October 17, 2015",3.0 out of 5 stars,High value i-7 laptop with serious BIG flaws,"I bought this machine from Staples for $600 after rebates. This is my third Toshiba laptop in the last two years. The first one was the S50 i7 based, so I thought this one is at least better than the two years old S50. But I was not happy with this purchase after two week using it. Here is the summary:The GOODs:1. 12 GB of RAM: plenty for any use2. 1 TB of Hard Drive3. Bluetooth4. Back-lit keyboard (worth $20 upgrade)5. Better battery life (But come with performance downgrade)6. Windows 10 preloadedThe BADs:1. i7-5500u only has two cores: its performance is probably equivalent to the older generation i3 dual core processor. Noticeably worse than older i-7 quad core. This is one BIG disappointment for me: I did not do research on this new Intel processor family for laptop; trade off performance for battery life2. Materials and feel seem cheap; The sharp four corner edges are nightmareThe UGLYs:1. The fan is running all the time. And worst yet, it is VERY LOUD. To keep it down, it had to go to BIOS power control and turn off the Dynamic clock and the Turbo clock. After that, this laptop is quieter but rums VERY VERY slow: probably slower than my one year old dual core i3","Toshiba Satellite S55-C5274 15.6 Inch Laptop (Intel Core i7-5500U 2.4 GHz, 12GB DDR3L-SDRAM, 1TB HDD, Windows 10 Home 64-bit)",$499.95l,reviews5.csv
27,27,Natasha,"February 16, 2017",2.0 out of 5 stars,meh.,"This computer does what you need it to do for the most part. I got this as a gift for Christmas in 2015 It is February of 2017, so it is a little over a year old now, and I am having a lot of issues with it. It never wants to connect to the internet. I have excellent signal strengths and I can have my Wii U running Netflix with absolutely no problems but this computer will not connect to the internet. It isn't consistent, either. I always get up and do the whole unplug/plug back in your router, which doesn't do anything! Eventually, I will give up and just use my phone and hope that it will connect again. (Thank goodness for google docs and drive!) The trackpad buttons click obnoxiously and feel incredibly flimsy. The edges of the laptop are pointy and sharp at times. The lid isn't the prettiest, but I think they are trying to imitate mac at some level; their computers always have a classic look after all. The lid gets scratched easily and I 100% hate the little letters on the lid!! They get caught in your laptop bag (if you have one). The silver letters will fall off and leave little black rubber stopper things. I was worried that something would pop that little rubber stopper off, so I covered it with a sticker. I am not a fan of stickers on laptops either, so I wasn't happy with that. On top of all of the other issues, the battery has decided to start breaking. I keep it on the charger all night so I have a nice charge for school and work, but it is always at 80% battery life even though it was on the charger all night. The battery has been draining faster, forcing me to carry the charger with me. While I was in class today I put it on the charger since it all of a sudden had 20% battery life; I got off work and went to my classes, which start at 1 pm and by 2 pm it was at 50% by 2:30 I was at 20%. So, something is obviously up with the battery. Anyways, when I connected it to the charger I got a message saying it cannot be charged. I got fed up and just shut the laptop at that point. I needed to show something to my professor, which I typed on Word not google docs due to my school's online system only being compatible with Word documents, and I had 80% again, this was at 2:45-2:50. Yes, the computer has a nice hard drive and powerful processor and all that, but I have found that it isn't worth the price. Spend the extra and get a mac or get one under  $500 that will be more reliable. This one replaced a laptop I got at Walmart for $250 and they gave me a $50 gift card for buying that laptop. It lasted 4 years! Price doesn't always equal quality material. If you need a computer for school related stuff, either as a student or a teacher, go for something else. I am not the best person with technology but I can manage okay on my own and this computer just isn't the best it could be for the price.","Toshiba Satellite S55-C5274 15.6 Inch Laptop (Intel Core i7-5500U 2.4 GHz, 12GB DDR3L-SDRAM, 1TB HDD, Windows 10 Home 64-bit)",$499.95l,reviews5.csv

I checked the programs and apps that run during startup but nothing extensive is running during startup so the hard drive has to be a pretty slow one. The screen and audio are pretty decent.

30,30,Amazon Customer,"January 13, 2016",4.0 out of 5 stars,Toshiba vs HP vs Samsung.,"After 4 years of using the Samsung laptop I purchased to use for college (at age 50), it literally caught fire on my lap. As such, I had to run to Staples on December 27, 2015 for some type of replacement. For $570.00 After rebates, I bought the HP 15T Notebook, It lasted exactly 3 days, on December 30th about 10PM is started flashing a bright blue screen and failed completely. Thankfully, Staples has a no nonsense 14 day return policy as I called HP support, and he informed me for a total of $94.00 he would repair the computer remotely. I explained it was 3 days old and The HP SUPPORT EMPLOYEE again told me it would be $94.00, only this time gave me an option, pay him or take it back to the store. I had taken the unit back to Staples, they gave me another of the same model, it lasted exactly 9 days and failed completely. Again, Staples had accepted the laptop back, and there was NO WAY I was taking another HP home with me. As such, I purchased the Toshiba Satellite 5274 and LOVE IT at this point. I am NOT a Gamer etc, I do NOT edit photos either. I do however, write College and Professional papers etc. This unit seems to run far faster than the HP's and is much better quality in my opinion. The Toshiba was 160.00 more than the HP, but believe me, the piece of mind that come with knowing I will not again lose another 22 page research paper makes the additional cost worth every penny.  This Toshiba is a good unit. I have been advised to steer clear of the basic entry level Toshiba's as they are having a dramatic issue with wireless convertibility. If I had access to another Samsung, the exact model that actually caught fire on my lap, I would have bought another one of those in a hot minute even with the out dated technology, that Samsung NEVER FAILED ME ONE TIME IN 4 years of college abuse.","Toshiba Satellite S55-C5274 15.6 Inch Laptop (Intel Core i7-5500U 2.4 GHz, 12GB DDR3L-SDRAM, 1TB HDD, Windows 10 Home 64-bit)",$499.95l,reviews5.csv
31,31,Brian from Northern California,"October 14, 2015",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great performance for the price,"Bought this for my son who is pursuing engineering and wanted a laptop that could keep up with the programs he uses (Like AutoCad/Inventor3D) and maybe even last through college. Found this on sale at Staples for $599.00 right at the end of September. So, for the money I just couldn't pass this up. With the i7 processor, 12GB of Ram and 1TB HDD, this laptop has NO problems running any programs. At first we had internet connections issues which I think came from an update trying to install before we had the computer fully configured, but one call to Toshiba and they corrected the problem right away. Must say the Toshiba tech support was impressive! Only two negatives to report are 1.) The edges of this thing are sharp. It's part of the design which is nice but If you spend a lot of time on the machine it can become annoying. Especially compared to my other Toshiba P775 which has rounded edges. And 2.) This is not so much a negative or complaint as much as an observation; in shopping around I found the latest form of hard-drive in laptops are actually not a traditional hard drive at all but a form of FLASH memory. No experience with one so can't speak to if it's as great as they claim but for the same price or more you only get 15-20% of the 1TB capacity this has and if  Flash memory does turn out to be revolutionary then this computer could become obsolete sooner than I'd like. All-in-all I'd say I'm very happy with this computer and my son hasn't had any complaints either.","Toshiba Satellite S55-C5274 15.6 Inch Laptop (Intel Core i7-5500U 2.4 GHz, 12GB DDR3L-SDRAM, 1TB HDD, Windows 10 Home 64-bit)",$499.95l,reviews5.csv

I had to fight with OneDrive to get it to stop trying to sync my files without my permission and I'm having some trouble downloading drivers for my older printers but I don't think any of those problems are because of Toshiba, they're Microsoft problems.  My only complaint so far is the edges of this laptop are very sharp and rough. While I'm resting my wrists on this thing its is digging into my skin.  I have marks on my skin and I've only been typing for about 15 minutes. The finish of this laptop seems a little cheap. I had a Sony Vaio before this upgrade and the finishing on that machine was much nicer.  I'm going to have to figure out a DIY way to smooth out the edges of this laptop or it will be unusable for long bouts of typing.","Toshiba Satellite S55-C5274 15.6 Inch Laptop (Intel Core i7-5500U 2.4 GHz, 12GB DDR3L-SDRAM, 1TB HDD, Windows 10 Home 64-bit)",$499.95l,reviews5.csv

However, my experience with this laptop is relevant if you are considering a Toshiba laptop, i think.  In 2012 I took the laptop out of the country and used it rather extensively in the Ukraine (220V) very successfully.  I returned home, plugged it in and have had it out of the house only to take it to Best Buy to have some work done--expanding the Ram to 16 GB.  After 2 years or so, I was running at 8 GB and no one at BB could explain this, but it wasn't under warranty. They suggested that possibly one of the two memory slots, which were replaced so that I could have an 8 GB plus 8 GB = 16 setup, had failed. There was not way to easily check this out.What did I do? I went on eBay, bought two 8 GB DDR3 memory boards (I was assured any would fit) and prayed they would work.  They did not at first.  A little wiggling, more prayer, and I'm running at 16 GB now as desired. No, I don't run a lot of graphics, but during the day I tend to have a number of programs piling up without closing some....the AMAZING thing is that after I reluctantly accepted the Windows 10 64 bit conversion, learning it, and using a two different Canon printers (one couldn't be repaired) and various Canon scanners, I have never otherwise turned the computer off for any reason.  I am getting a message that my battery needs replacing, and it might...but on the other hand, as this did not come with a 5 GHz wireless plug in, so I am using an Ethernet connection now, this laptop is still running, in November of 2018!  I am using Malawarebytes for system protection, and a back-up hard drive.  To find a letter in my email written in 2013 is very easy. I have high confidence in Toshiba, and bought another one as a backup.  I dropped it in a way that it could not be repaired (my fault), I'm now testing a Lenovo with 16 GB as my replacement cutoff was $600--and the Lenovo came with a DVD drive, the Satellite did not.  I hope not to be reporting aging on my computer longevity for a long time.","Toshiba Satellite S55-C5274 15.6 Inch Laptop (Intel Core i7-5500U 2.4 GHz, 12GB DDR3L-SDRAM, 1TB HDD, Windows 10 Home 64-bit)",$499.95l,reviews5.csv

I dealt with Toshiba support and still over 4 months later do not have a working laptop. I was also charged a $159 fee for support from Toshiba to assist me for a computer under warranty. Toshiba charges the fee up front because they say it ""may"" be software related. After 6 weeks of Toshiba support working remotely on my laptop, they finally agreed to send the computer to their repair center. Got it back 3 weeks later with a replaced hard drive and again the computer blue screened and shut down on its own. Called back Toshiba support and they now charged me $59 for Mcafee software saying my Norton Utilities was the problem and I needed to use Mcafee because it was ""preferred"" security software. Once again the computer blue screened and again I was told to send it back to the repair center. Still no working computer after more than 4 months and paying Toshiba support over $200 for a computer under warranty? As for Staples, no help at all.

37,37,Tony G.,"January 8, 2016",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Toshiba S55-C5274 Performs well, lots of nice features.","Bought this at OfficeMax for a great price after rebate after researching several Dell and Toshiba models. My previous laptop was a Toshiba 17"" that I got in 2009. It ran great for six years and still does, just that the CPU is old by today's standards, kind of slow, and could only hold 4GB ram max, so I wanted something faster with a newer processor.I really miss the larger 17"" display, but I can get used to it. Otherwise this S55-C5274 has everything else I was looking for. Large 1TB hard drive, 12GB of ram, and the Intel® Core™ i7-5500U Processor with turbo boost (it runs between 2.4Ghz up to 3.0GHz as needed). This laptop boots really quick for my purposes, yes I could put in a 500GB SSD for a couple of hundred bucks and gain an even faster boot time, but for my needs this laptop is quick enough as-is.This laptop has dual band WiFi with 802.11ac, where the majority of laptops I considered were only 802.11n capable, so that's a plus.Another feature I was looking for was a backlit keyboard, this is a great feature when working in bed with dim lighting. As soon as you touch a key the entire keyboard back lights. The backlit feature times out after a period of no key press (about 12 seconds, but I think it is adjustable in settings).Also another plus, all three USB ports are USB 3.0, with one of them supporting ""sleep and charge"" where you can charge a USB device while the laptop is in sleep mode or OFF.There are only two things I can complain about:1. No HardDisk activity light. I like knowing when there is hard drive activity so you can tell if the PC is locked up or not during lengthy operations.  Why omit this feature? An LED only costs about 10 cents.2. The audio quality could be a bit better.

38,38,Meg,"August 5, 2018",1.0 out of 5 stars,Has not held up well,"I got this model about two years ago, and it is now literally falling apart; the front of the DVD player fell off in my hand this morning. It had always felt loose ever since I got it, and today it just dropped right off the computer when I picked it up. The touch pad has never registered a right-click unless I jam it down. It occasionally decides not to charge, which would be less of a problem if the battery life wasn't so bad. As others have mentioned, the fan is constantly running and is super loud, and it tends to get very warm very quickly, to the point where it is uncomfortable to have in your lap. I'm not even a gamer; the most I'm asking this thing to run is Netflix.I had heard good things about Toshiba, but overall, I'm very disappointed. All of my prior laptops have lasted at least 4 years before needing to be replaced, but I feel like even one more year would be pushing it for this one. I'll be looking elsewhere when I need a replacement.","Toshiba Satellite S55-C5274 15.6 Inch Laptop (Intel Core i7-5500U 2.4 GHz, 12GB DDR3L-SDRAM, 1TB HDD, Windows 10 Home 64-bit)",$499.95l,reviews5.csv

When you go to Toshiba Support to troubleshoot, it suggests you turn it off and then on again, using the F5 key.  Then you discover that the F5 key does what the F4 key label says it is supposed to do - toggle between the laptop and external monitors.  Several other really terrible design choices.  In addition to not working, touchpad is off-center on the devise.  To use the F1-F12 keys you have to hold the FN key down (in other words, rather than just hitting F2 to quickly edit a formula in Excel, you have to hold down FN-F2 - otherwise you turn down the brightness of the screen).  The edges of the laptop are sharp, so that when you are typing and you lean your wrists on the machine, the edges cut into your skin.  There are a lot of other issues, but I suspect they are Windows 10 related (which is a whole other issue).  I had a Toshiba Portege that worked well from startup 5 years ago until it got too small to use all the new bloated software, so I thought I would be OK buying another Toshiba.  BIG MISTAKE.

My first toshiba was an earlier version of the Satellite series and it lasted all through high school and most of my college career. This laptop however started falling apart the moment I purchased it. It came with a manufacturing flaw, three light spots on the screen from damaged pixels. Three months in there was a problem with the wifi chip. I called Toshiba to send in the computer however they wouldn't let me access my guarantee (Which I paid $50 for) without paying a crazy $116 customer service subscription. I ended up bringing it to a private guy and now I have to use an external wifi stick because he couldn't figure out what was wrong with the chip. I have owned it for eight months and the speakers are fading out, I can't lean the screen back past a 90 degree angle without the screen going blank. The keyboard has three sticky keys with one missing. Its a lot of expensive features in a cheap frame.

I had to disable all sorts of Windows 10 animations just to get it to the point where it was usable, but by then, I realized that my wrists were in terrible pain, as the edges of the bottom portion are all sharp and pointy.

44,44,Robert Sala,"June 12, 2016",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great price for the specs!,"Let me start by saying that a lot of the negative reviews that I am reading have to do with the operating system (Windows 10) and it's updates. These same complaints I read them with other brands, not just Toshiba. Where does the problem rely? Your using Microsoft! Microsoft impacts the physical and virtual memory thus affecting the battery endurance plus the processor speed. Thus is why we also hear the fan really kicking it in order to keep the processor and video card cool. I left Windows and Apple years ago (10 years to be exact) and have been an avid user of Linux. Linux does not hog your memory, does not defragment, does not need an antivirus since there are no known viruses, trojans, rootkits, RAT's or malware than can affect the operating system. As a result, you get a behaved pc or laptop that maximzes the performance without impacting it's resources; the battery, ram, graphics card, hard drive speed, etc. I use Deepin OS and it makes this laptop run incredibly smooth. As to the person that said the screen looks ""glary"", there are thousand of pc's or laptops that come this way. If it makes you happy, buy an anti-glare screen protection like the cellphones and it performs a double feature. Thus Tishiba has a truebrite HD screen and that is a good thing! As to the person saying that the corners are sharp, really?! Give me a break! This laptop is NOoT heavy and it is beautifully finished. So there it is folks, change your operating system to your favorite Linux distribution and this laptop outperforms others for the specs and price!","Toshiba Satellite S55-C5274 15.6 Inch Laptop (Intel Core i7-5500U 2.4 GHz, 12GB DDR3L-SDRAM, 1TB HDD, Windows 10 Home 64-bit)",$499.95l,reviews5.csv

0,0,Ricky,"September 21, 2012",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great bang for the buck!,"I used to be a notebook geek, through and through, and used to write write reviews.  So I'd like to think that I know a thing or two about laptops, but it's been a while, and I'll have to resign myself to the fact that I'm now a common laptop user, and by no means an expert.With that said, I'd still have to say that this is a great purchase.  I recently had to part ways with my trusty Asus EEE PC Netbook, which gave me almost two years of solid, dependable day to day use before showing some signs of being obsolete.  (Yes, seriously.  I used a netbook almost every day for 2 years and did just fine!)  I'm thinking about doing a lot more work on my laptop in my spare time, so I decided to opt for a laptop with a bit more horsepower.  More importantly, I travel a lot for work, and have a corporate laptop as well, so this would be the second laptop I'd carry with me on a plane on a week to week basis.  Thus, I needed something thin, light, and somewhat robust.  After doing what I thought was a reasonable amount of research, and agonizing over all the models I liked in my shopping cart, this Portege was the last one standing.  So far... I'm impressed.  I'll try to make my points a bit more succint:Competitor models that I agonized over:- Asus Zenbooks- MacBook Air- Lenovo U300/U400 seriesWhat I like:- Thin: It's no macbook air, but this laptop along with my 12"" HP work laptop both fit into the one laptop compartment in my laptop bag pretty comfortably.- Light: It's surprisingly light, for it's size.  It LOOKS a lot heavier than it feels.- Battery Life: It keeps fluctuating, but after a few cycles of use, it seems to over somewhere between 6-8 hours, with the lowest screen brightness and moderate internet and word processing usage.  Update - It took about 30 minutes to write this review, and now at 90% it's still saying 7 hours 50 minutes....- Optical drive: I know it's a dying media, but it's handy if you are like me and like burning dvd's/cd's for backups every so often.- Tons of ports: Haven't tried them all yet, but this was a big factor.  I wanted a MacBook air, but hate the idea of having to order extra cables and carry them around, just to use ethernet.  (Yes, I still use ethernet every so often to plug directly into some routers for testing/setup purposes)- Full HDMI and VGA: No mini HDMI, or no adapters needed to get video out, unlike Apple/Asus.- Minimal bloatware: None of the factory installed software has been too annoying or pop up like so far, except for the Norton reminder.  I'm going to uninstall it and install AVG anyway.- Big hard drive: I'm just not somebody that lives in the cloud, and can't make do with a limited size SSD drive.  Fine, SSD is fast, but I don't have huge data transfer needs... just on the go storage needs.- Fast: Everything is functioning pretty snappy right now.  Windows loads quickly, opening the lid resumes it from sleep mode quickly, logging on is fast.  The 4GB of RAM out of the box is just fine for now and will probably need an upgrade in 1-3 years (I hope!).- Keyboard size: Chiclet keys are spaced well enough, to still allow dedicated buttons for home/page up/end etc.- Quiet operation: For average surfing and documentation, the fans stay in fairly quiet mode.  Rendering multiple videos can get the fan to kick in, but it's not overly loud.What I don't like:- Build Quality: It looks nice, but feels cheap.  Super plasticy.  That said, applying pressure to the back of the screen doesn't seem to cause any distortion to the screen- Mouse pad: Clicking sound of the buttons sound plasticy, cheap and hollow.  Also, the mouse pad surface, is more rough than the palm rest.... explain?- No backlight: I know, I know.  It never said there was one, and I knew that when I bought it, but when trying to use it in bed yesterday while my wife was asleep, it was kinda hard to see the function buttons, especially when I've never used it before.- Volume: Volume is modified by pressing the FN + 3 or 4 keys, but no on screen display for volume control.What could be better but I can learn to ignore:- Keyboard: The keys are kind of slippery, and feels weird, but you get used to it.  Sounds a bit clickety clackety, but it's not bad, and you can get used to it.  No issues with mistyping.- Chrome hinges: They look kind of plasticy too, but look ok from a distance.  If you read the reviews, and THIS is your biggest concern, then you might need to rethink what you're looking for.  Also, I think complaints about weak hinges are unfounded.  My screen is holding pretty steady, and I have to give the laptop a good shake to get it to move.- Screen: 1080p videos can be rendered, and look ok, but the screen doesn't POP.  Definitely not a gamer or digital media buff's dream screen, but for day to day use, it does just fine.  I wish it wasn't glossy, but so far I haven't really had any issues with glare.Overall verdict: I really wanted a MacBook air or a zenbook, but at nearly $600 cheaper, the Portege has almost all the same features, and is thicker, but still manages to be incredibly light and somewhat portable.  It's a favourite with PCMag, provides lots of out of the box features, looks good from afar, and is perfectly functional.  My last three laptops have been Asus, and I had some cash to blow on a laptop, but when you compare the Feature to $'s ratio, this laptop clearly comes out on top.

1,1,Peter Marinari,"June 10, 2012",2.0 out of 5 stars,Quick computer not suitable for those who work and play hard,"The Toshiba Portege R835-P94 is a Windows laptop that is fine for wireless productivity in your home or on the occasional business trip, but it is not made to stand up to daily wear and tear of a heavy user. It's a pity, because it's a fast, efficient machine.BACKGROUND:I previously owned an indestructible, tiny SamSung NetBook, but after three years of using it 8-12 hours a day the keyboard was finally giving out. I am a HEAVY user, and while I'm not rough on my electronics, they do need to survive constant use and the jostles that come with a daily urban commute. I needed something light, portable, and sturdy that would allow me to be productive ALL DAY and EVERYWHERE - on my couch, riding the subway, walking to meetings at work, at lunch in the city, and between sets with my band.Four months into my purchase and I have many regrets, but depending on how you use a laptop you might not have the same turnoffs as I do.THE GOOD:Right out of the box, the Portege R835-P94 seems as though it is a decent MacBook Air competitor. That's not why I purchased it - I'm not a Mac fan - but when I held it next to my wife's Mac the form factor and weight were a close match, even if this machine is much more plastic-y.This Portege comes right up to the limit of what I consider portable. Any bigger and it just wouldn't work in tight situations like airplanes. While heavier than NetBooks, this machine is still very lightweight for its size.First and foremost, I think the battery life is stellar. On a relatively bright, high-functioning battery setting I can get 6-8 hours. It's rare that I ever run out battery unexpectedly and - if I do - it charges fast.Second, it is quick. It boots quickly, hibernates intelligently, and shuts down in a flash. I used it for a week with the installed RAM for internet, word processing and spreadsheets, video, and minor image manipulation with nary a moment of slowdown. An easily removed panel allowed me to beef up the RAM in two slots - not necessary, but easy to do with ",Toshiba Portégé R835-P94 13.3-Inch Laptop (Magnesium Blue),"$2,333.00",reviews6.csv

3,3,DaveM,"April 13, 2012",2.0 out of 5 stars,Avoid Toshiba computers,"!)The machine is decently ergonomic, with a full-sized keyboard and a slightly off-center track pad with two click buttons. The function keys make sense, and a guide to them overlays onscreen when you press function. I do object to the Page Up and Down buttons being relegated to a vertical row on the side rather than being nested on either side of the up arrow (which is available), but that's a personal preference.The screen is really bright and clear, though it does glare at some angles and on darker content due to its gloss finish. The CD/DVD drive is a lifesaver, and I marvel at how they managed to fit it in.I was relieved to find that the computer has hardly any junk software I associate with most major laptop brands. Aside from standard MicroSoft programs, there's not much of anything pre-loaded. If you haven't used Windows 7 before, it is transparent. It has not once gotten in the way of my daily use, and in some instances of hunting for features or settings I think it is a considerable improvement over XP.THE BAD:Despite all of my likes of this machine, they cannot overcome the fact that the build quality is cheap. Yes, that makes it light, but it's not worth the trade-off!My left hinge fell off within my first day of use. I can push it back on, but it has never fit snugly. The battery locks fell out the first time I set it down sharply on a counter at lunch, and never went back in the same. The hinges are weak, allowing the screen to swing with any small amount of momentum or a strong breeze (I'm not joking!).A few keys are already missing my keystrokes. They just don't depress and rebound fast enough to keep up with my typing - I switch to a desktop to write anything lengthy, which defeats the purpose of having a laptop! Also, the trackpad is beginning to show signs of failure.However, my major complaint is the hard drive. I have had complete hard drive failures within the first 100 days of ownership of every Toshiba product I've bought in the past year, and this laptop was no exception. My old NetBook survived being accidentally punted down a shallow set of stairs and all of the other abuse of three years of daily use. This computer? Three months and a dead HD, right in the middle of my work day - no punts! I replaced it with a Solid State ",Toshiba Portégé R835-P94 13.3-Inch Laptop (Magnesium Blue),"$2,333.00",reviews6.csv
4,4,Dave D,"September 11, 2012",2.0 out of 5 stars,Computer problem - bad support,", which I recommend doing RIGHT AWAY if you decide to purchase it. It was as easy to install as RAM, and it only took about two hours to load the factory settings from backup DVDs (which you have to make yourself or order for an additional fee).This machine can be loud. Not at rest - the fan is audible, but not annoyingly so. I read other reviews stating the mouse buttons were loud. This seemed like a trivial complaint to me, but they really are! No matter how gently you click, they make an obnoxiously loud KERTHUNK. The chicklet style keys are also rather clacky, and extremely squeaky since day one (even with a dab of WD-40). The DVD drive is incredibly loud - I think prohibitively so if you plan to watch anything. Also, the computer weirdly emits a loud chirp every so often - I assumed this was the hard drive, but it continues to do so even with the SSHD installed.Another minor complaint - there is no on-screen overlay when you raise or lower the volume with function keys. I thought for sure something was broken until I Googled it! The sound is decent for a laptop - loud, but no bottom end.Finally, while glossy finishes make for attractive electronics, they also mean you are constantly wiping away dirt and smears. It's no big deal, but if you are the kind of person who needs your electronics to look elegant and spotless this might not work for you. The screen shows smudges very quickly, so keep a microfiber cloth handy in your case.BOTTOM LINE:This laptop is probably heaven sent for lighter users who simply want something that will keep them surfing and productive when they need a connection. If that's what you want, I cautiously recommend it - though, I do endorse springing for the solid-state HD.My complaints are those of someone who LIVES on a laptop. It's where I work, play, and create. If you're like me - who uses a machine morning until night, who juggles it between meetings and writes thousands of words a day - the Portege is just not ready for the task. You'll be shedding plastic pieces, wincing at the loud and squeaky keys, and praying the HD doesn't fail between cloud backups.I can tell this is not going to last three years - it has already broken in at least three ways in four months!

5,5,Alex Papadimoulis,"August 29, 2012",5.0 out of 5 stars,A Wonderful Almost-Ultrabook,"If you want a compact and lightweight laptop that doesn't compromise on functionality and still looks great (and doesn't cost an arm and a leg), then this one's for you. I've been carrying around a 15.5"" Sony Vaio for the past 2.5 years--don't get me wrong, I love that chunker--but it got pretty beat up, the battery life was absolutely horrible, and I dreaded having to lug it around in my backpack all day for classes (I'm a full-time college student). So I started looking for a replacement. Buying the Toshiba Portege R835-P94 was one of the best choices I've made in purchasing technology. Here's my breakdown of the pros and cons:Pros.1. It only weighs 3 pounds! I can do curls with it on my weak arm for ten minutes and not feel a thing. (well, maybe that's exaggerating, but it's ridiculously light!)2. It's gorgeous. The exterior looks black in low light, but every once in a while I'll catch a glimpse of that ""magnesium blue,"" and it makes me happy. Not to mention the slight texturing on the cover makes it look even better.3. The thing fits into my purse. It's nice not to have to take my backpack somewhere just because I'm bringing my laptop.4. Battery life! I haven't actually sat down and timed how long it can last, but I do know I can watch a 2-hour-long movie, an episode of The Office, and work on a paper (all in high brightness and volume) and still have a solid 40% left. I can't even describe how wonderful it is to take it out for the day, use it during classes and in the student center, and not have to take the power cord with me. It's fantastic.5. The touchpad. My Vaio didn't have multitouch, and it had some funny texturing on the touchpad. But this Toshiba's touchpad is glorious. It's smooth and super convenient, and it doesn't jump at all when you try to move the mouse.6. Speed. It's very fast--I haven't had any issues whatsoever with trying to download things or access ""busy"" web pages.Cons.1. Smudges and fingerprints. Because the laptop's a darker color, dust and oils show up on the keys and cover a lot easier than they do on a lighter shade. But of course you can clean it off regularly if that bothers you. It's definitely not worth passing up this baby for.2. Microphone placement. I like to Skype with friends and family, and I was a little annoyed to find out that the microphone is located on the front right corner of the laptop base right next to the SD slot. It's easy to forget it's there and accidentally rub over it with my wrist when I'm multitasking with working on a project and Skyping, because then the noise kills whoever I'm talking to. Not a great idea to put that there.3. Speakers. They do their job, but I can tell the difference between these speakers and my Vaio's.

6,6,Ken McWilliams,"March 8, 2012",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good laptop & value,"Update as of May, 2015. The thing is about shot. Very disappointed with service life. Crashes frequently. DVD player no longer works. Next computer will not be a Toshiba.Update as of Dec/2012- I am not as happy as I was with this purchase, but still consider it to be a good value in this product area.Reasons for lowering my initial review:1. Fan runs almost continuously. This has gotten to be an area of huge annoyance for me. I havent really tracked this from the beginning, but one day a few months back I was working and noticed the fan never really stopped. Now, of course I notice it all the time. Had I known this was going to happen, I probably wouldnt have bought this computer.2. Battery life has dropped significantly over time. I would say it's down 40% from when I first started using it.Bottom-line- if you are really using the computer to work,like I do, you might keep on looking, and the fan noise will drive you nuts eventually.Do still love the low weight though!Update as of 04/20/2012-  still extremely pleased with this computer. The Bluetooth was really easy to install and found my cell phone the first time (I have had trouble with other computers). Bluetoothed serveral pix and found the transfer was faster than normal.I have had this computer for a week now. So far I am really happy. It is very light (I have to carry two LT's)and it fits well in my backpack. The battery life is excellent. I have used it on battery for about 5 hours and it was down to about 1/3 charge when I plugged in.I also liked the fact I could delete some of the factory installed software-completely. I get sick of all the pop-ups begging you to activate their software. I have had computers where this was impossible (for the average user) and had to live with these popups.There is not a lot else to say. I am a 'light"" computer user (no gaming, or high tech uses) The applications I do run (MS) open quickly so,  plenty of memory (4-GB) and the 640 GB hard drive will store all my picures and videos. As I said, I travel a lot and take pix and videos as mementos.I recommend this PC to anybody who travels a lot and needs a personal PC to take with them. It is an excellent value for money!One note- if you get one, also buy a padded sleeve to protect it. Being so thin means it is fairly fragile and evidently (reading other reviews Toshiba is pretty firm on their 'damage' policy- if you break the screen you might as well throw this one away as the screen replacement will cost as much as new computer. just take care of it and you shouldnt have any trouble)Good luck!",Toshiba Portégé R835-P94 13.3-Inch Laptop (Magnesium Blue),"$2,333.00",reviews6.csv
7,7,Ronulus,"June 27, 2012",5.0 out of 5 stars,FIRST DAY OUT OF BOX...FREEZES OUT OF HIBERNATION,"After purchasing this laptop for my daugher for college, at first we were quite happy with it.  She used it for about two months.  However, just a few weeks before school was to start, it developed a problem wherein the computer would shut off when disconnected from charger - as if there was no battery at all, even though it showed 100% and charging.  When talking to a support person, it was concluded that I would have to return the computer to them for repair.  They told me it would be in the ""Depot"" for 7-10 business days.  I explained the need to have it back quickly because of college starting.  It fell on deaf ears, because he said it will still be the standard 7-10 days. They sent shipping materials and it was sent back the same day. Well, it will soon be a month now, and their repair status page showed that the repair was completed, and that it was being prepared for shipping.  After hearing and receiving nothing, checking back on the status page showed that the computer was back in repair again.  There is no way of contacting them about the repair, either by telephone or by email. All they do after several telephone prompts is refer me back to the repair status page.  I will never again purchase another Toshiba product.  Buyer beware... if you have a problem, don't rely on Toshiba to fix it.  My daughter has been at college now for two+ weeks, and without a computer thanks to Toshiba.  Who knows how much longer it will be.By way of update... after contacting Toshiba by way of their website feedback (the only way I could find to send them a message), they did respond and informed me that the computer did not pass the testing phase and had to be sent back to repair - and they were waiting on parts.  This is the kind of thing they need to keep their customers ""in the loop"" about, but failed to do so.  A lady there named Julie personally looked into my case, and I think sped things along.  Bottom line is that the computer was returned in good working order.  From the day I shipped it to Toshiba until the day I had it back was 1 month and 1 day.",Toshiba Portégé R835-P94 13.3-Inch Laptop (Magnesium Blue),"$2,333.00",reviews6.csv
8,8,BGS,"May 29, 2012",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Computer....Great Value,"I had been doing the desktop *and* laptop thing for about 5 years now, the idea being that a laptop was just not a suitable replacement. And then someone told me about the Ultrabooks. Wow. Highly portable, grown-up computers (as opposed to the toy netbooks) with a crazy battery life. For real?But the more I looked into Ultrabooks, the less I liked: * I want real, full-sized ports. VGA, HDMI, Ethernet. I don't have time for adapters, and I don't want to be that jerk who goes around trying to borrow someone's adapter. No one likes that guy. * I like a removable battery. Maybe I'll want to buy a spare, or a giant aftermarket protuding battery that I won't need. I want options. * I don't want to carry around or have to borrow an optical drive. The world isn't all USB Thumbdrives, don't kid yourself. It's an extra expense and you'll just end up carrying it with you when you travel. And again, you'll be the jerk without the optical drive. * I don't need fancy-pants beveling and sleek looks. I don't have time for that, either. I spent all my fancy-pants time writing this review.So then I found this computer, which is an almost-ultrabook. I bought a 128GB SSD, 8GB upgrade, a USB3.0 Dock, a spare adapter for home, and BAM, now my life is even more awesome. I even got a man-purse/satchel that I carry it around it.Few other points...I did the fresh Windows 7 Pro thing, and found it was a little bit of a hassle finding the drivers, but it almost always is (especially on newer computers that haven't made it to Windows Update yet), so no points loss for that. It's the price you pay for no bloatware.The small screen and keyboard took a little getting used to, but it's fine. I have a keyboard/dock/mouse at work, and use it at home, planes, hotels, etc. with sometimes a mouse. Works fine.",Toshiba Portégé R835-P94 13.3-Inch Laptop (Magnesium Blue),"$2,333.00",reviews6.csv
9,9,Dennis Berthold,"June 14, 2012",5.0 out of 5 stars,Incredible Value and Functionality,"I haven't had this one very long, but after installing some high end programs (Adobe CS-5 suite, Corel Draw X5, Video Studio pro, and MS Office) and running them, I am very pleased with the results. No problems at all installing or running the programs. I loaded and edited eight high res photos in Photoshop with no problems. The small screen doesn't give me the view or capabilities of my 25"" monitor & desktop computer, and I would not like to do any serious graphic design work on the Toshiba, but for what it was intended for, it does very well.If you would like to see more reviews on the Toshiba R835-P94, look at the Toshiba R835-P81, it is the same computer except the P94 also has Bluetooth and is over $100 cheaper. The P94 is an Amazon exclusive, which probably accounts for the lower price. The P81 comes with 6 GB of ram while the P94 only has 4 GB. The 4 GB of ram is fine for most applications and most users, but I like to max-out my ram. I bought two 4 GB high speed ram modules (a total of 8 GBs) for $46 and the P94 is noticeably faster. Installation of the ram is very easy.A real shocker was discovering that the battery power lasts almost as long as advertised. Amazing! I have never had a laptop that even came close to this one.I'm not a ""gamer"" so I can't speak to its capabilities in that arena, but I have watched streaming movies, and DVD's with no problems. The only negative things that I have noticed so far are that it has a narrow vertical viewing angle. I'm comparing it to my old Sony Vaio which has a larger and very good screen. The other negative is the ton of bloat ware programs that Toshiba loads on the computer. I doubt that you will ever use the majority of them. Sadly, it seems that all of the manufacturers are doing this now.Overall, the Toshiba R835-P94 is very good computer for the price.

It whites out all of the text and the colors don't show up normally. I have to switch between the balanced and eco setting a few times to get the color and lighting to come back to a normal look again. I have yet to figure out if this happens when I'm in the balanced setting or the eco setting, or even both. Either way, it's not a big deal because it's easy enough to push down the FN button and F2 several times to rebalance the lighting.Overall, I would recommend this laptop.

The CD drive is so loud & vibrates when there's a cd in there that I have to hold my hand on the computer while its running to quiet the noise.

I'm not sure whether there is a different optimal pixel configuration at different brightness settings, and something is out of sync.

0,0,Nia Bwell,"September 23, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,For Some Reason Mine Has Touchscreen?,"I'm very happy with this laptop. I waited up all day yesterday waiting for it to come home. I enjoy playing games and wanted a powerful laptop to handle games like Ark: Survival Evolved and World of Warcraft. So, I am happy to report this laptop does a very good job of doing that.It's a very powerful laptop. The strongest I've ever had was a 4RAM, and of course that's not enough to play some of these heavier games which require a lot of room. And with 1TB of space I finally have the room to download what I need without having to store it on my external hard drive. So, there's a plus.As other reviewers have stated they keyboard can be a bit iffy. This honestly depends on a personal preference. The keyboard is a little shallow. Each key is ""separate"" in a with it's own little space. I personally believe this is a good design since it can help prevent the keys from getting dust and other gunk in them. Even so I had ordered a keyboard cover ahead of time. The keyboard does light up when you start typing on it which I thought was pretty cool. I type a lot and I have to keep reminding myself I don't have to press down so hard on the keys when I type.Even so, I don't mind that much. I use an external mouse and I did invest in a usb extender for this laptop. There are three usb ports, but two are on the right side while one is on the left. I would suggest getting a usb extender at the very least for this laptop. Especially if you like to backup a lot of files or are using this laptop for work and play. A decent one only costs like $10 if that. It's a good investment and can save a lot of frustration later.My only thing I found odd is that for some reason the one I received includes a touchscreen. I thought this was odd and thought on the packaging this was just a mistake. Nope. The Toshiba Satellite I received is indeed touchscreen. This doesn't bother me since I don't care either way. I rarely use touchscreen as it is and had wanted a laptop without it just to prevent smears on my screen. However, it was a nice little surprise regardless. So maybe they updated the laptop to be touchscreen?Regardless, I love this powerful laptop. Sound is excellent on it. It has bluetooth. A few things you may want to invest in for it though are: USB Extender, Keyboard Cover, and a decent set of Bluetooth speakers if you want your sound really loud (or headphones.) Give this laptop 5 stars. It's the first one I've ever bought on my own. I love the Toshiba brand.Update 10/12/2015: Computer still works great. The sound for this computer is not quite as loud as I would like it, but good enough for watching Youtube or something. Putting in a pair of headphones or having a decent bluetooth speaker does the trick too.","2015 Toshiba Satellite S55-B5280 High Performance Laptop, Intel Core i7-5500U(up to 3.0GHz), 15.6-inch HD Display, 12GB DDR3L, 1TB HDD, Windows 8.1",$565.00,reviews7.csv
1,1,Putputt,"May 26, 2015",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not too impressed.,"Okay, so I've only had this laptop for a few days, and I am returning it because I think I was unlucky enough to get one with connectivity issues. Ever since Day 1 it has a bad habit of disconnecting me for a few seconds and then reconnecting me. None of the other laptops or gadgets in the house is doing it, so it's definitely not a modem issue.Aside from that, which again, is probably just my bad luck, I haven't been too impressed or disappointed by this laptop. There was something weird that kept happening the first few days, which was that whenever the computer went to Sleep mode, all my windows would close. Firefox, Chrome...they'd just close, as though the computer had been shut down. What's even weirder is that it stopped doing that after about 3 days or so. There were also other things...like when I changed the desktop wallpaper, it changed back to its old wallpaper automatically. I had to change it several times before it stayed. It's really strange as these are not issues I have ever had with any of my previous laptops. I have no clue what happened there, but it's one of the reasons why my first days with the laptop were so rough.I haven't bothered installing any of my games on this, so I don't know how it performs gaming-wise. I have noticed the laptop becoming warmer under my wrists when I open Google Docs, which is surprising because I didn't think Google Docs is that demanding. I am currently using the laptop in Norcal, but I live in the tropics, so it worries me that it's becoming warm in Norcal weather.On a more superficial level, the laptop looks fine when it's open, but when closed, it is really ugly. This doesn't bother me much, but it's maybe worth pointing out. :DAll in all, for the price, I'm not too impressed with it. I think there are better laptops within the price range out there.","2015 Toshiba Satellite S55-B5280 High Performance Laptop, Intel Core i7-5500U(up to 3.0GHz), 15.6-inch HD Display, 12GB DDR3L, 1TB HDD, Windows 8.1",$565.00,reviews7.csv
2,2,Ricardo,"July 28, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,So far the best laptop I've ever used,"I think this is my first review ever on a purchase at Amazon. So far (1 week) I am very happy with this laptop. First I have to say I had my concerns over buying a ""like new"" item. Well, it was really like new, and I mean new. The laptop had even the original plastic cover on the screen.Regarding the laptop per se, I bought it for my wife who work as a graphic designer, and I just can say that the laptop exceeded our expectations. It is very fast (it is a 12 gb ram pc), very quiet and by far much less heavier that my old laptop.In some reviews I read that there some issues with the keyboard and the touch pad. In that department, we don't have any complaints yet. The keyboard itself is very responsive, and it is very quiet when you type, also I like the fact that is has the numeric pad just like a regular PC keyboard. The touchpad responds also very nice, it has some cool functions like zooming just like the touch screen of a cell phone, but then my wife it's going to be using a mouse so the touch pad wasn't even an issue.I will try to write an update after using the laptop for some time, but so far so good......

3,3,That One Lady,"April 17, 2015",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Fast, Relatviely Light and Thin, A Few Downsides","So I should start by saying I really like this laptop. It is quite fast, great battery life for a full size laptop, and seems to handle whatever I throw at it quite nicely. It's kind of large for the screen size - when it arrived I thought I had accidentally purchased the 17"" but it's just that there is an inch or so extra on the left and right sides of the keyboard. Not sure why they made that choice, but it's been fine after my initial surprise.The system feels pretty solid although I have noticed a bit of flex in the top (display) when I am walking around with it. The keyboard has a nice feel, and the touch pad is responsive, good overall. My one quibble with the touch pad is that clicking is quite loud.Overall, so far it has performed exceptionally well, especially for the price point.The main reason it isn't getting 5 stars is something I didn't think through until it actually arrived. The battery isn't user-replaceable. Which makes it almost a disposable laptop when the battery starts losing life or dies.

My husband had a Toshiba for over 10 years as his main computer at home and it served him well. I liked that when I took it out of the box and turned it on, it did not boot to the Windows 8 screen... I am looking forward to Windows 10 coming out later in the month.The computer has been easy to set up and move all my files from my other computer without any problems. Looking forward to using this computer.REVISION TO MY REVIEW AS OF October 14, 2015After using the computer since July 15, 2015 the keyboard stopped working. I spoke with Toshiba about the problem since it was within the first 90 days of ownership, I contacted Toshiba about the problem. Before they would talk to me, I had to purchase the 'Premium Protection Plan' to the tune of $159.95.. The tech attempted to fix the problem on line, however that didn't work. I was transferred to a higher level of tech and they wanted me to send the computer back to them. I had to pay an additional $30 to get a box and shipping label to ship it back to Toshiba. I purchased the box and they sent it to me via FedEx... I boxed the computer up and sent it back on Monday, October 5, 2015 and got it back, supposedly repaired on Friday, October 9, 2015. I got home from work, opened the box, read the report about they were able to 'duplicate the problem' with the same results I had reported. They replaced the keyboard cable and my computer was repaired.' I took the computer out of the box, plugged it in, turned it on, logged into my account, and that's as far as I could go. After entering my user name and password, The keyboard would not let me go any further than logging in. When I attempted to check my email and write responses,it would not allow me to go any further. I called Toshiba back to let them know the computer was not repaired, their answer was for me to send it back to them again, and they would 'try' to repair it again.I know this wasn't a very expensive computer, however, I did expect it to work for more than a few days. I used my old computer daily since 2005...and I am typing this update on my review on my old computer...It's slow and old, but it still works.I opened a chat dialog with Customer Service at  Amazon about the problem, explained everything to them, they offered to give me a refund on the computer.

1,1,Amazon Customer,"May 3, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,Exceptional for the Price,"This is an exceptional laptop for the price. I would say this computer offers real value--you could pay $200 or more and get less performance from other laptops.I see some people write negative reviews because1. - Mouse pad did not work and2. - WiFi dropping. I initially had both these problems, then I read the manual. Both of these things are controlled by the function keys, and when I discovered that, all my problems went away in about 2 seconds.As a low-end laptop, it has the Pentium chip, which was the standard just a few years ago. The Pentium is a great workhorse and is especially good with the 8 gigs of RAM this computer comes with. I use MS Word and PowerPoint extensively on this laptop and performance is excellent as you would expect. I am still using software from a few years ago, notably Photoshop CS4 and InDesign CS4, and they run as fast as ever. I also run audio recording software, and I have no problems with recording or playback.This laptop also streams Amazon Prime and Netflix videos just fine. The screen is not full HD (1920 x 1080), but it is sharp and clear and most people will be more than satisfied with the resolution and color of the regular HD (1280 x 720) that this screen displays.Any drawbacks? I could hope for a better keyboard. It works as expected, but takes getting used to. If I were to use this laptop to replace my desktop (unlikely), I would plug-in a full sized keyboard. It takes no effort to plug-in both a standard keyboard and big monitor, so that is a possibility.I'm a computer guy and have put this laptop through its paces.

0,0,Clay,"December 18, 2015",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great machine with a bad track pad that is easily fixed.,"I've only had this laptop for a couple of weeks now, but so far I am enjoying it. I haven't put it through any strenuous tasks yet, just lots of video streaming and some basic picture/gif editing, but it seems to be quick enough and operates smoothly. There was one annoyance right out of the box that almost made me send it back the next day: the touch pad was very glitchy, delayed and sometimes completely unresponsive. However, a quick google search led me to instructions on how to fix the problem myself. All I had to do was uninstall the touch pad driver, then download and reinstall the current driver from Toshiba's website. It didn't take very long at all and now the touch pad works fine. That and the bloatware, which is to be expected on pretty much all pre-built computers these days, are my only gripes so far.The display is great. I was somewhat against getting a touchscreen laptop at first but it has turned out to be pretty handy, I like it. The tablet mode is cool as well for relaxing on the couch and watching videos. I also find the backlit keyboard to be a nice feature in the dark.The sound quality is quite noticeable. These speakers are crystal clear even at high volumes, and they get LOUD.The overall build quality seems sturdy. It feels like a well-built machine despite the plastic casing. I think they could have used a matte finish instead of glossy to give it an aluminum-like feel and gotten away with it just fine, though.The SSD is small, and I bought this with the anticipation that I will likely upgrade to a larger SSD in the future. I read that it is much cheaper to buy a laptop with a small SSD and upgrade than it is to buy one with a large SSD already built in, which makes sense. I will say, though, that the SSD is considerably faster than most standard hard drives when it comes to start-up and opening programs. This computer restarts super quickly, which is nice.So if you're like me and just want a fast computer that's great for media and basic photo editing, this is definitely one to consider.",Toshiba Satellite Fusion 15 L55W-C5259 15.6-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Laptop,$439.00,reviews9.csv
1,1,Rajkh,"October 21, 2015",5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the price,"As you can see most of the reviews are from vine customers of free product and many freezeup complaints. So was skeptical at first to buy this laptop, but after a month of using it I would say it is a great buy at this price.The bootup is super fast due to SSD. Regarding the 128GB SSD,  people need to understand the difference between SSD and HDD. SSD is faster and hence costly! If you want higher memory space you could pay less for HDD and get a slower laptop. This laptop is not for storage! If you want to store your pictures you can use various cloud services out there like amazon's own photos app which comes free with prime membership or google photos both of which offers unlimited storage.Downloads are fast due to 802.11ac and there is no hangup while downloads like mentioned in other reviews. As with the touchpad freezing, I have had no such issues. Few times I thought I had the trackpad issues I had disabled the touchpad control by clicking on the F5 function key which doubles as enable/disable the touchpad. Probably you are trying to refresh the page with the function keys like you are used to in desktop keyboard and disabled the touchpad. In fact I dont use the touchpad much, if I have issues with touchpad I use the touchscreen. Keyboard is sleek macbook like and doesnt make much noise which I love. Backlight is cool but I am unable to find options to turn it off during day when it isn't needed -- found that FN+Z can be used for turning backlight on and off .Windows 10 isn't much different. Cortana voice assistant opens only in build apps and not the ones you download. Most of the search redirects to Bing.Display is beautiful and 4K videos does play, its little jittery when playing fast paced songs. I think can't expect much from the i5 processor or mobile hd graphics. I am not a gamer, so cannot comment on gaming experience.Audio wise it isn't good as beats as in my other hp laptop.Heavy for a tablet but can be propped up or folded on a table and can be used for long hours.Regarding the tablet mode change complaint that it doesnt work, It asks whether you want to exit/enter tablet mode and also whether you want to 'Always ask before changing' or 'Remember my decision'. I chose remember and it does remember.Doesn't heat up much.

2,2,JSE,"October 9, 2015",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall, very nice upgrade from laptops in 2012.","It's a really nice laptop. I was hesitant about Windows 10, being a Windows 7 user prior to the upgrade. But friends and my bf suggested that I need to just engage with it and get used to it. The screen is clear and large. The 360 function is pretty cool. I like how the fan is in the back instead of the bottom. The cord is nice and small, but can heat up a lot. I wish the sleeping function would last longer. Meaning I could leave it for 24 hours still on sleep then just hit my space ar and it would turn back on again. Instead I have to use the power button every single time. Which i don't like to do, because I fear of wearing it out. I have to turn it on and off multiple times a day since I use it for classes and work. I love the keyboard; it's smooth to type on, and so far pretty easy to clean.What I don't like about it, is that the edges of the laptop base itself (on the side of the mouse pad), has a rubbery lip, that is kind of uncomfortable to rest my forearms on, while i type. Which I type for long periods of time, doing research, papers, or taking lecture notes.The other thing I don't like about it, is the fact that it's not very easy to open it from the closed position. I have to angle it in a way where gravity will help it open, then carefully pry the two edges apart. My last laptop had a little lip that I could easily push on to open it. But that must be because of the 360 design...Overall, a wonderful upgrade from my Lenovo I've had for 4 years.",Toshiba Satellite Fusion 15 L55W-C5259 15.6-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Laptop,$439.00,reviews9.csv
3,3,Paul M.,"March 11, 2017",3.0 out of 5 stars,Great computer but unreliable hardware and supply chain.,"There are some great things about this computer.  Lightweight, fast great screen.  I still wouldn't buy it again and will buy from a different manufacturer.At just less than a year old, it crashed and I had to reload it.  I didn't lose any data since I keep everything in the cloud but had to reload programs and set everything up again.At a year and a half old, the battery died.  It had been fine, then it quit working.  The laptop worked fine when plugged into a power receptacle. Ok, it happens, so I started searching the web for a replacement and couldn't find one.  I checked with my  local computer store and they could only find one at a sketchy website, so I called Toshiba.  They referred me to their parts supplier, who told me they don't sell those batteries. I called the company they suggested, a large tech parts supplier and they had one....but it would take almost a month to get it.  Ok fine, I'll wait.At a month since I ordered the battery, I got a notice today that it's been back ordered from the manufacturer and there's no estimate on when it will be available.If you buy this computer, be ready for it to become a desktop.

For me this means: HP, Toshiba, Dell, Lenovo in this product class and in that order of preference based on previous purchases both professionally and personally.Price was the other measure and deal maker.  This Toshiba with the latest SSD fit the bill.SUPER FAST product because of the SSD mainly.  Gorgeous screen and keyboard. Fun to type on actually.  Excellent battery life. Many think it's an Apple Mac....I do NOT recommend that one buys anything without SSD.  This IS your purchase measuring stick that would really be noticeable in terms of speed performance and how long your storage drive would last.  Look ma, no spinning mechanical device!Only con but is livable... wish Toshiba shipped a model with a LARGER SSD drive, but price point would have been a problem at the time of purchase.

5,5,Angeline I. Olliff,"January 21, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,My favorite piece of tech machinery!,"This is by far my most prized possession (excepting my recent auto buy). It's beautiful, and for a l5+in. screen, it's lightweight and easy to use both as a tablet and actually a top my lap.I've had it for a full year now and still 100% recomend it.One noteworthy annoyance: one day about 3 months ago, it failed to start. Not only that, but it also had zero responsiveness--no charging light, no whirring sounds, no keyboard light, not even a flicker of life on the screen. After researching and trying every troubleshooting strategy offered by Google & Toshiba, I got through to cust.srv. @Toshiba. They then asked me to re-do those measures in case I'm an idiot, all to no avail. Next was a $30 fee for a special box in which I would send the device to their Tennessee warehouse for inspection. This was stressful a) bc Toshiba wasn't clear about warranty coverage/exclusion, b) their site implied I'd be charged for the call!, and c) it took 2-3weeks to get it back, all the while playing phone tag w/reps. The final correspondence amounted to this:""When I pressed the power button, it turned on. We are now returning your device.""So, I'm out $30. It hasn't recurred. Fingers crossed. And the lesson: Keep the original packaging & don't heed the suggestion to purchase a fancy shipping box if this happens to you.One other problem: when switching to tablet mode, it is often slow to deactive the physical keyboard.I still love this thing.",Toshiba Satellite Fusion 15 L55W-C5259 15.6-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Laptop,$439.00,reviews9.csv

That person pointed out that the keys are lettered as F1, F2, etc.,, but in tiny lettering on the corner of the keycaps, in a faint, brownish color. So is the Fn shift key at the bottom of the keyboard.I took the Toshiba to the daylight at the window and, sure enough, the tiny lettering was there as described.But I use Fn keys a lot, and usually in a low light setting. And the keyboard backlighting, while fine for the main keyboard, is no help for the Fn keys.Maybe one could get used to the relative position of the keys, but why put up with that?I returned the item reluctantly.Otherwise, seems to be a fine laptop.",Toshiba Satellite Fusion 15 L55W-C5259 15.6-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Laptop,$439.00,reviews9.csv

But for everyday use, this thing is great. The SSD drive is quiet and the computer doesn't run hot or noisy at all. The touch screen is accurate (although it is a fingerprint magnet) and the versatility of the 360 degree hinge makes it fantastic for watching movies or video clips. I like the size because it has a full-sized keyboard with separate number pad - the whole keyboard is backlit.Sound is pretty good, although I admit that I'm not the best judge of high-fidelity.
