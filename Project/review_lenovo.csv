I am a Comp Sci student and one of the software I needed for my course was very RAM heavy (Android Studio is anyone is interested). The 8GB of RAM mentioned is true however you will only get to use about 6GB. This is because the hardware reserves 2GB of ram to actually run the laptop (I think?). In summary, if you are going to be using RAM heavy software, I would recommend going for a 16GB laptop instead (which was my mistake, sadly).","Lenovo IdeaPad 3 14 Laptop, Intel Core i3-1005G1, 4GB RAM, 128GB Storage, 14.0"" FHD Display, Windows 10 S",&328,review1.csv

0,0,Anthony,"December 23, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Laptop - Highly Responsive and Great Touch Screen,"Overall, I would say the laptop is great. It is definitely worth the price of around $300. It is small, lightweight (although could be more), responsive, looks great, smells new after months, smooth to use, track pad is pretty good,overall good chromebook.I'm not really too much of a Tech person but grew up with computers in my 20's mostly using it for school and personal stuff.I had it for a few months now so my beginning concerns aren't the same as my latter ones. I'll try to go over really quickly the basic beginning concerns I had then go through with my impressions with months of use later on. 1366 X 768 isn't HD but it's acceptable. Processing speed is 2.1 ghz, never had a problem or issue with lags. 4 gb ram is okay, probably wouldnt do 2 gb. 11.6 screen, I wanted something smaller so this is a plus to me. Bit heavy with 2.64 lbs for a small laptop but it's okay, still my lightest one. internet connection is good and bluetooth use was good. Processor never had a problem with Mediatek. Convertible to tablet mode is a plus. Solid state so processes quickly which is a big plus. Battery life is great, I hate charging and finding an outlet, but this goes on for more than 8-10 hours, just doing school stuff, no videos. I would say I searched like crazy in the beginning. I wanted one main personal laptop and one small convertible laptop and this was the best convertible one I could find on Amazon. I compared like 20+ laptops over a week, I was really putting a ridiculous amount of time on it. But I had specific things I wanted in mine, like speed, aesthetics, smooth performance, and valued those more than other things. I wanted things to be really convenient.I have started using chromebooks more because they are inexpensive and very convenient to use. They aren't too good for hardcore processing, but for school work or personal work, it meets all my needs. Whenever I use it, everything is pretty smooth and seamless. Start and shut down are almost instant. I have never had an issue with it's use so far. I think for me, the biggest plus is the elegance. It makes everything very easy to use, it looks great, it even retains its new smell after some months with light use. My other laptops have poor track pads but this one is infinitely better. I don't feel the need to use a wireless mouse as well. I ended up getting a screen protector for it for almost $20 because it was a touch screen. I like how it has a lot of features like hdmi cables, one usbs, even a memory card slot. I think for the price, it is definitely worth it. It feels like a very high end chromebook, although I generally wouldn't pay too much for a laptop in general because I don't need high processing. The buttons feel nice and smooth. There hasn't been much lag or delay time. Updates are easy and smooth. Screen is nice to look at and the colors are great. There doesn't seem to be much glare and it feels aesthetically pleasing. Yeah everything's really nice with this.There are some things I don't like about it though. Originally, I had planned to use this as a tablet part-time because I didn't want to buy paper textbooks. I thought of using all of it on this chromebook, but it turned out to not be convenient because it was too heavy. I would use it on the train and my hands would almost immediately get tired trying to read. I would have to rest is down on myself, which isn't a big deal but wanted something I could read ebooks and pdfs on conveniently. I don't know if I will end up getting another one to serve that purpose. It also is a chromebook so it cannot download files and stuff. I don't particularly like that because that stops it from being my main computer. I don't like putting personal stuff on my drive, like my expenses or whatever even though it is irrational and I do it with some apps. Maybe I should, but the fact that everything is on my drive to see makes me feel a bit uncomfortable. I don't mind that this computer cannot really do much without internet because I always have something saved on it. It has 64 gb of memory which I think is quite significant. I mean, if I couldn't put anything on the drive, I wouldn't feel that, but 64 gb + drive storage seems more than enough and I am trying to be a minimalist anyway. Yeah not that many cons.Anyway, I wanted a inexpensive laptop but this definitely performs up to par with most laptops. Never had a problem with it so far months into my purchase but did want something I could use as a tablet. Would definitely recommend. Definitely better than a lot of the stuff I grew up with that cost 3x more. Best laptop I could find and really pleasantly surprised overall in many areas.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289,review10.csv
1,1,Groingo,"March 31, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,A very  unexpected surprise!,"Renewed Lenovo C330 arrived in a huge box clearly marked HEAVY LOAD....someone had a sense of humor being that the whole thing weighed only 4 pounds and you could have put ten of these in boxes inside their big box!Opening the box the description had said it had cosmetic damage on the sides and gouges on the case, close inspection revealed no damage, it was MINT condition plus the moment I cracked the lid open it was already setting itself up and after a couple of minutes it was ready to go, (try that WINDOWS!) it had syncd itself from my other Chromebook!The main reason I bought the Lenovo Chromebook was to see first hand how it compared to the two Acer Chromebooks I have, the Acer Spin 713 and the Acer R13, both having a lot of aggrivating issues relating to OS integration.Acer both 713 and R13 had serious issues with poor sound loudness and quality, image quality is poor even though they were running over 2000 resolution, poor internet speed as both 713 and R13 kept switching to lower speed settings, while virtual keyboard settings in both Acer's suffered from serious lag, and screen fragmentation, Bluetooth pairing was poor with continual drops and no restart if computer woke from sleep and slower overall performance on and offline if used as a tablet.Lenovo: Suffers from none of the above and excel's in many areas starting with Sound which is LOUD, image quality even with a low 1366 resolution is tight, sharp, and vivid, internet speed stayed where you put it and is quick, virtual keyboard no issues, Bluetooth pairs easily and is ready after sleep with no drops, tablet performance no different, quick and precise.I agree with some other comments that this is a really handsome computer, the eggshell white with dark grey keys is a real eye catcher, that backed up by a great overall experience and I just noticed the price for these as renewed from the Amazon Warehouse has dropped, you will NOT be dissapointed!Now for the real twist:  I have bought 9 different Chromebooks over the past couple of months to see if they had that something special that makes them indespensible and I must honestly say that my Fire Tablets 7 through 10 and ONLY the Fire Tablets are much more useful, easy to use, take a ton less space, have much broader uses, easier to take with, typically much higher video, image and sound quality and much faster on the internet and cost waaaay less but give you so much more, so the grand experiment is done and I will be finding some good homes for the Chromebooks.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289,review10.csv
2,2,Josh Hartman,"November 30, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Far exceeded my expectations,"Full disclosure, I am not an IT professional but use laptops, tablets, and desktop computers daily in my personal and work life. This chromebook has far exceeded my expectations. This is my first time using a chromebook. I have had a week or so to really dig into the device. I own an alienware gaming laptop, but I find myself only using it now for gaming purposes only.This chromebook is fast in my opinion. The speed is snappy and the device responds quickly to gestures and commands. I have yet to find sometime I can't do on this that I do on my windows laptop aside from gaming. One game I like to play requires windows, mac, or linux. Since this has an ARM processor it does not support linux applications at this time.Design: This device is a bright attractive white chromebook. I find the design to be pleasing to the eye and appears sturdy even though it is made from plastic. I do not particularly like using it in tablet mode. The screen feels bulky and sometimes unmanageable in tablet mode. The screen quickly transitions to whatever position to place it in whether laptop, tent, or tablet mode. I personal find myself not even using my LG tablet for much of anything except when I need LTE internet away from home. Overall the design is great.Screen/Input: I find the keyboard to be on par with most laptop keyboards. The keys are a little shallow and I feel my typing has slowed a little bit, but not by much. The IPS touchscreen is very responsive and rarely find myself having to touch the screen more than once for my intended gesture. Screen is bright in home conditions, but feel it would lack in more intense lighting situations, such as outdoors.Ease of Use: The google play store makes this thing be able to do just about anything. I have not tried any intense applications. I use chrome, netflix, hulu, evernote, several banking apps, and various other apps. All of them are snappy responsive. The bank apps load like they are in phone mode, thus they are in a small window. The apps still work as designed. Netflix and Hulu playback is smooth and pleasant to watch on the screen.Overall, I am impressed with the Google OS and this device in general. If your someone who is on the fence about the operating system, I suggest you give it a try. The battery life is good as well. When using my gaming laptop its always with a cord tethered nearby. I also understand a gaming laptop is far more power intensive. I have yet to use this chromebook while charging it. The battery has allowed me to watch 4-5 hours of netflix, talk on facebook, and text through my phone without ever getting critically low. I charge it at night and then never put it back on till the next night. This is a max screen brightness. I was also very surprised with the speakers. The speakers were much louder and not distorted. I honestly expected them to be cheap netbook quality that is mostly better just to never use them, but thats not the case with this chromebook. I do generally use a bluetooth headset. The bluetooth headset paired with extreme simplicity. I also set up my brother wireless laser printer with google cloud print in less than 30 seconds.Google did it right and lenovo delivered a solid product. I did purchase this on sale for $200 but would have spent the $300. If your a web surfer, music listener, netflix watcher I highly recommend this. If you need windows intense software then go with windows. Otherwise I think you'll find yourself using this as your primary device as I have.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289,review10.csv

6,6,John,"August 22, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Chromebook but with a few nitpicks,"I was curious on what a chromebook had to offer since i never used or owned one and i'm in need of a laptop since i'm living somewhere else.This chromebook is fairly light and small and gets the job done and there little to no wait time when you open the chromebook turning on automatically.There a bunch of things i noticed while using it is you can link your phone with the chromebook in where once you previously log into the chromebook beforehand you can unlock your chromebook right after by unlocking your phone (both have to have bluetooth enable). To search up shortcuts you can easily click the search button on the keyboard and type in shortcut and it have it where you can search all the shortcuts you can do and what nice is any additional keyboard say a bluetooth one can also do some of the shortcuts.Also there are options where you can close the laptop and you have two options you can either put the laptop to sleep or it just turns off the screen then there a option to lock it by closing it or not. nice note is if you have display off you can still listen to pandora,mp3,or youtube.Also for those who are wondering - you can play minecraft, ragnorak mobile (not fully keyboard control it only for texting in chat so no WASD movement) and hearthstone on it so it have it nice touch but you cant use the split screen feature from chrome so that a bummer now for the drawbacks. Also you can use microsoft word, excel and powerpoint from the googleplay store but you would need a account for it or just use the free online version.This is small nit pick - the screen is 720p yet it clear but it is noticeable when you use it long enough wish it was HD or 1080p also some apps are set to the 720p by default. the google play store youtube uses the quality of the screen while chrome youtube (basically youtube normally on browser) is more clear. Also skype doesn't have screenshare or sharesound so that a major bummer and skype seem to run slow on the chromebook in terms having people sharescreen their desktop it always come out blurry on some occasions and i have to minimize and reopen skype to actually see what going on. i haven't try video call yet so it up to debate. Lastly for discord from google playstore you would need to adjust some of the call setting for it to work. the default setting would cut you off mid sentence and random pausing in between.Another thing is you can't adjust the idle timer it either it goes to sleep, display turns off or stays on there no option to change it and when you have option to lock your desktop it end your skype call so you would have to go into settings for normal use, call use, and game use.lastly is your better off having your laptop go into sleep mode with locked instead of turning it off. when you shut it down the screen goes blank white then gets brighter and brighter then goes to black. it's just me being paranoid like it would be better if it just dims and turns off instead of going very bright then poof black not to mention if you usually play on medium to low brightness setting then having your screen go maximum brightness with no setting to change it get annoying not to mention when you open up your chromebook after shutting it off it adjusted your brightness setting as well as well a bright chrome logo before going into login. Mostly this is a nit pick since it bothersome when you are using it in middle of the night then when you turn it off it hit you with the brightest setting so i just end up closing it to sleep mode or shut off and look away.All in all it a pretty good chromebook i just wish it had more options in the settings as well have priority app settings in task manager","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289,review10.csv

9,9,THG,"September 8, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Incredible value for the price,"I bought this computer while on a trip to replace a different Lenovo computer that died while I was on deadline for an assignment while traveling. Fortunately, I was able to get this next-day Prime delivered to where I was staying in LA and began using it minutes after it arrived. To make this review easy, I'm breaking it down by main key features: display, keyboard, battery life, and build quality.Display: For the price, I don't think you're going to find one much nicer in terms of resolution and quality. Incredibly, you are getting a true IPS panel with nice viewing angles. I've found that the low res matte displays on other cheaper Chromebooks are incredibly difficult use and lead to eye strain. I'm a personal believer in purchasing as much screen real estate and pixel density as possible -- it really does make a huge difference. Another huge plus (and I'm not sure if this across the Chromebook line or specific to this one) is the night mode that cuts out blue light and boosts yellows -- this is another hugely important feature for me, personally. Touch screen functionality works fine. Display cons are that the bezels are massive and with it being super glossy, there can be lots of glare.Keyboard: Basically Lenovo has it figured out with keyboard layouts and feel. While it's nowhere near as nice as the Thinkpad keyboard, this one is laid out quite nicely and is easy to complete bigger writing assignments on. There's no backlight, which would be a huge plus, but for the price, it's difficult to find anything to complain about. The top row function keys will be familiar to those coming from the Mac ecosystem. Everything is very easy. The trackpad is also surprisingly nice for the price as well. Gestures work without issue.Battery life: This is where this computer truly shines. I purchased this while I was traveling during the winter and needed to it to complete weekly freelance assignments and had plenty of battery life while on the road. Even when being back home laying in bed watching Youtube or Netflix, the battery lasts all night, and then some. I basically never take the charger with me because I don't feel that it's necessary (unless it's already low on juice). In terms of just general surfing and Google doc stuff, you should be able to get a couple of days out of the battery. If you're watching videos and streaming, it's still a good full day's worth of battery life.Build quality: I've previously had an HP Chromebook and was not impressed by the build quality by any means. It felt cheap, almost like a toy. While this Lenovo Chromebook feels much more solid, I still wouldn't compare it to a Thinkpad or the higher end machines in Lenovo's lineup. Still, it feels quite durable and I've never worried about carrying it in a pack all day, or stacking books and other heavy items on top of it. The only thing that is kind of a bother is that the brilliant white finish does get smudges and dirty fingerprints on it. But that's more of a nuisance, not a flaw with the machine.For the price, you really can't do much better. So long as you have reasonable expectations for what you're getting and how much you're paying, you will be very pleased by this product.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289,review10.csv

13,13,James M.,"February 9, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,First Chromebook.  Very Impressed.,"Regarding Chrome OS.  This is my first chromebook so I'm still learning, but so far I'm extremely impressed!  It seems like the chromebook was the computer I've always needed but never realized I wanted!  Marrying the pc experience to an android compatible operating system is magical.  Although I'm apprehensive about this browser-based computing, I've found it very easy to save and edit documents offline so I'm still able to work on the go.  I can also connect it to my android phone, send and receive text messages with it, emulate old school video games (GBC, NES, SNES, GBA, and NDS), connect it to my bluetooth speakers and blast some jams.  I regret not making Chrome OS a part of my life MUCH sooner!Regarding performance.  I've heard people say this processor is mediocre.  I have to ask, what are those people even doing to arrive at the conclusion?!  I have not once seen the slightest indication that this thing isn't *completely* competent for daily needs.  Incredible response time.  No lag when scrolling.  Minimal to no delay opening apps.  Stunningly fast start up time.  I feel like it's a pretty outstanding performer, overall.  Sure, it's no high end gaming machine, but who buys a Chromebook looking for advanced gaming capabilities?  The bottom line: you click; the computer responds instantly.  Really, what more could you ask for?Regarding the build quality.  It's a bit bulky in its ""tablet"" mode and lacks the premium build materials of high end chromebooks, but it still looks and feels great - certainly better than any laptop PC I've ever owned!  The white color is gorgeous.  The size is perfect.  The keyboard is comfortable and the touch pad is large and responsive.  If you look closely you'll see Lenovo coated the touch pad with a hefty clear coat to prevent wear and tear.  As someone who immediately coats touch pads with contact paper to prevent damage, this is an impressive step, however inconspicuous to the average user.  Additionally the hinge feels solid and smooth.  The construction of the entire build just feels extremely sturdy.  The monitor produces extremely sharp images with outstanding color.  Although many people express dissatisfaction with the lack of 1080p and the larger bezels framing the monitor, I didn't even notice!  If you're not planning to do professional photo editing, I doubt you'll notice either.  (Side note: If bezels really concern you, consider the experience of flipping this into tablet mode and walking around with it while working.  Wider bezels in this situation result in fewer accidental screen taps from fingers that are curled around the edges holding it.)I absolutely recommend this chromebook.  It's a steal at this price point, and stands to replace my quad core, 8gb Windows 10 laptop for most of my computing needs.  Sure, it's not a 1080p monitor, lacks a backlit keyboard, and isn't made out of aluminum, but goodness gracious if isn't the coolest, most practical little laptop I've ever owned.It was even featured as one of the best chromebooks money can buy as of Feb 2019 by Android Police and Android Authority!!","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289,review10.csv

15,15,Nick B,"February 8, 2019",4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent value for the money!,"I'm on the second week now of using the Lenovo C330 convertible Chromebook (there are multiple models on the site under C330 so I'm specifying it is the model with 4GB RAM, 64GB SSD,  MediaTek MT8173C processor). I needed to replace my 9 year old Macbook Pro that was an excellent machine but just couldn't handle modern computing needs. However, I have a desktop for more intense computing needs, so I really didn't want to spend $1000+ on a new MacBook to browse the web, watch YouTube videos, read eBooks, watch Netflix etc in the evening. Cheap laptops in the sub $350 range are frankly almost all junk, so I wasn't really interested in buying one of those either. I don't want a tablet because I want a keyboard and I like to lie flat in bed and that's just not convenient.Enter the Chromebook! So far, this has been an impressive solution for the purchase price of $231. Of course, Chromebooks have a variety of hardware and you need to do your homework to get the best experience. For about $50 more than lesser Chrombooks, this is an ideal middle ground solution. Within its comparable price range, the MediaTek MT8173C processor scores at the top as far as processing speed. Coupled with 4GB DDR3 RAM and a 64 GB SSD for boot speed, plus how lightweight of an OS ChromeOS is, this is a very well performing little machine for the price. Web browsing is snappy, YouTube loads very quickly and the Google Play store gives you access to all the apps you need. So far, all apps have loaded without any issues and function well. The battery life is remarkable - I've gotten 13-14 hours of use from it and still had 15% when I finally plugged it in. ChromeOS is super easy to learn/user friendly and reminds me of the user experience of a phone/tablet.NOW - this machine is not a few things. It doesn't have a super high resolution screen, but it's a small screen, so it's not bad, but if you're used to a Retina screen it will be a bit lower in quality. It is fine and perfectly functional, but not exceptional, as a tablet (not the best touch screen response and obviously heavier than normal tablets and ChromeOS isn't as optimized for touch screen use compared to phone/tablet operating systems - think things like bigger front/back/X buttons - those aren't as prevalent on ChromeOS). The keypad is nice and sensitive but the click is loud. Printing is probably a pain but I have a desktop for that, so I don't care. So far, those are really the only cons I have found to this machine, but the pros far outweigh and you need to be realistic about features vs. price. It does a lot of things really well at the current list price of $251. It is not a $1000 laptop and you simply can't expect $1000 features from it.I'm very glad I spent the extra money for this over the sub-$200 Chromebooks with lower quality hardware and no convertible/touch screens. The convertible/touch really makes it fun to use.So, in summary: If you just need a machine to do run of the mill browsing, streaming, etc I think this is an almost perfect solution and an excellent value for the money.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289,review10.csv

17,17,tani,"March 19, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Works great... after updating.,"Right out of the box, we got it set up and started checking on different apps. Every issue we had with the little Chromebook was resolved after we updated it, except for an issue with forever being stuck on the loading screen for Audible.The issues we had right out of the box, which were fixed on update, were: Netflix was low quality (but every other streaming app worked fine), Audible would not load (didnt fix on update), couldn't scroll down on pages anywhere especially bad in Settings, and we had to minimize the Settings app every time we selected something otherwise it would pretend it was stuck. Now that its working after update, I have NO ISSUES that would cause me to be upset with the device. No Audible is fine, I use my phone for that 99% of the time, we just wanted to have it on the Chromebook because it was an available app, so no big deal on our end.  I will say that I don't use the volume speakers on the Chromebook (I use bluetooth headphones and speaker) but it is about as good as a cheap device is expected to have (it wont rock your world musically, no real bass), some people might have an issue with this.  I also do not use it to play any sort of game, so I don't have any feedback on using it that way.Altogether, I would buy this again in a heartbeat! Great product that handles me having many applications and Chrome tabs open at once.Update: After a few days of hard use, the machine is running excellently. Its able to work efficiently with multiple tabs and apps running at the same time, including video and audio streaming. My only complaints are that the screen wobbles slightly if used as a touchscreen in a laptop-position, folding it back into a laptop-position from a V or tablet-position feels concerning as the hinge is sort of tight and it makes you feel like you might break it if you go too fast or carelessly, and when using the keyboard the edge of the chromebook can bite into my wrists if I rest them on it but that's easily resolved by not placing the chromebook in a position higher than my hands sit. Still a great machine and would buy again!","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289,review10.csv
18,18,Kaleb,"September 27, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Incredible Chromebook,"This is my first Chromebook. I decided to get one because most of what I use a computer for doesn't require anything more heavy duty than what this has to offer. I'll still use my other computer should I require things like Photoshop or those heavier use programs, but since I got my Chromebook a week ago, I haven't even touched my other laptop.The Pros:Battery life - When it estimates that I have 12-13 hours of battery life, it means it. I can stream videos and multitask and it doesn't sacrifice that time. Time to charge is also impressively quick.Speed - I open the lid and it's on. It's that simple. No waiting for everything to load up. I had to do an update and it took maybe 10 seconds, including restart time. I know internet will vary depending on network, but I'm able to easily multitask and it's not dragging. I'm currently casting a video to my TV and have multiple tabs open on chrome, all with no lag to the video (which would often happen with my other laptop).Ease of use - If you're already a chrome/google user, switching over to a chromebook is a piece of cake. I didn't have to transfer anything, and I do have to eventually back a few more things up to my Drive, but again, that's easy. Getting used to more app-based programs than desktop ones is easy enough too.  Almost everything that would have required a windows download has an app version or a way to use it on a chromebook as well.Screen/Tablet mode - I haven't toyed too much with the touch screen, but it's a nice perk. I like being able to flip the screen around and turn it to the side and bam, it's a big tablet. So far I've only used it like this once to read some comics, but it was nice. Brightness is great too. I usually have it down halfway or less even.Size - I was worried about it being too small because my other laptop is somewhere between 13-14'' but it's a really great size. This thing is incredibly light too. Much lighter than I'd expected. Love it.The Cons, though extremely minor:Caps Lock - Mostly, it's a ""getting used to"" factor that I just haven't quite mastered yet. There's no caps lock key, and the search button that replaces it isn't terrible, but I think I'd have preferred to just have the caps key. (You can just press alt+search for caps lock easily enough though)Backlighting - my other computer had backlit keys. Totally an ""extra"" that's not necessary, but regardless.And that's it. If you're looking for something light and simple for everyday use, this is an incredible choice.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289,review10.csv

You can even use it as a tablet if you want to: just flip the screen around and there you are!I have a few Intel Celeron-based Chromebooks of similar age from competing manufacturers and this thing handily outperforms all of them.A few releases of Chrome OS (around the version 76-80 mark, and again sometime around beta versions 87/89 when the kernel was upgraded to version 4.19) demonstrated buggy behavior on this platform, but that seems to be all gone now.If you're buying this today, you'll want to be mindful of Google's automatic updates expiration policy, which is set in mid-2025 for this model. (It'll be here sooner than you think!) You can still use the Chromebook after that time, though you will not get any further software updates. Intel and AMD-based Chromebook models can sometimes be made to run other operating systems. Hopefully someone will do the same for ARM based models such as this Lenovo C330. I can definitely see myself still using this after 2025, if the battery and SSD hold out, and I'm fairly sure both will.There's really only thing I've ever found lacking from the Lenovo C330, and that's a backlit keyboard. Had Lenovo equipped it with one, this truly would have been the perfect Chromebook.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289,review10.csv
20,20,Amazon Customer,"April 21, 2020",1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't Buy- Lenovo Customer Service is Absolutely Horrendously Unhelpful,"Wow, what can I say.  For a product that is 5 months old let me list the ways that this has been a terrible experience.  Amazon, it's not your fault.  You need to stop selling Lenovo's products, though.1) The first day out of the box the unit failed to start up properly.  We used Lenovo's chat service and after zero troubleshooting attempts they decided that the unit was broken and we should mail it back to them for a repair/replacement.  It was Christmas morning, you try telling that to a kid.  After a few google searches, we figured out the obvious issue, and it started up beautifully.  This was my first foray into the most unhelpful customer service experience I've ever had.  Send it back??? OK, or try everything else first??2) After 3 weeks my son opened the unit and there was a hairline crack in the touchscreen from one corner to the next.  This never affected functionality, but one day while bored during COVID-19 lockdown, I again (stupidly) opened the chat and asked whether the screen could get repaired under a warranty because the reason for the break was not because we had done anything to damage it.  The answer was no, I should drop it off at BestBuy and someone there could decide whether the repair would cost me or be free.  Not during state lockdown, thankyou - a mother needs it for her kid to do distance learning.  The chat agent entered a ticket on my computer to document the broken screen but of course left out the information i provided on how it became cracked and that it was fully functional. How nice?3) In April, my son opened the laptop up to start his schoolwork and the Google chrome page continually refreshed every 8 seconds.  There was no way to prevent this from happening as the touchscreen and mousepad would disable every 5 seconds of the 8, so we could do limited things in those 3 seconds we had control of it before it re-set. So I tried chat.  Big mistake.  Lenovo chat does allow you to specify that you need troubleshooting and technical service help, but the person I got said they don't do that online and to call someone.  I called the phone number.  Here is the ridiculousness that ensued:a) First lady says it's a software issue, not a hardware issue and my hardware is under warranty but software is not.  I need to upgrade and pay for software support so that she can troubleshoot the issue for me.  Pay?  Why? You have not asked me a single question to determine what could be going on. Though she reassure me repeatedly I have reached the right help center and can correct my problem, since I‚Äôm unwilling to blindly pay for her help for their product,  She says she can't help me but to call a different phone number where maybe someone can help me for free...?b) annoyed, I call the next phone number.  Might I mention each time I call this place so far their phone message immediately says they're having high call volume and to schedule a return phone call, but I humor them and wait this time.  The phone is answered within 2 minutes.  High call volume...or you want to avoid helping customers because you do not have one tech on staff who actually can do that?  The person who answered the phone asked for my name and phone number and then hangs up on me.c) I call another customer support number and the person who answers sounds vaguely like the first person I talked to but if it was she plays dumb after taking my name and computer serial number.  This woman tells me that the reason google chrome is refreshing itself every 8 seconds is A HA! because I have a cracked screen on the unit and it‚Äôs not a functional touchscreen any longer (are you some omnipotent being?)  and this Entire issue is surely due to the crack in the screen so she can't help me. No other questions asked by the way. I say that is absurd, I can use the touchscreen for several seconds without issue and it‚Äôs been fully functional for months.  She tells me to take it to a local place to have it serviced because she can't help me over the phone.  When I remind her that my state is in COVID-19 lockdown, she tells me that it's pronablu, definitely a Google issue and to CALL GOOGLE for support with their software!d) not that google would have helped rather than send me back to Lenovo, Google is closed due to COVID-19 and their contact through chat was impossible to find online as well.We ended up powerwashing the unit.  Fixed.  Why couldn't one of the 4 people I contacted with Lenovo run down a few scenarios with me and end up at the same conclusion as my 10 year old did?  DO NOT BUY FROM THIS ABSURD COMPANY IF YOU WANT A PRAYER OF SUPPORT FOR THEIR DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289,review10.csv
21,21,Matthew Stearns,"December 25, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for a tablet replacement for older parents,"For the price, it is a good buy. My father had an issue with using a regular laptop for streaming (he needed something with an HDMI cable to plug into his TV). The laptop I gave him was of good quality, but had an older hard drive (not SSD) so it would take awhile to boot up, and it wouldn‚Äôt run as fast as I would like. This is a simple chromebook that is just what I would consider a decent option, boots up quick, runs pretty fast, stream quality and screen is acceptable, and it comes with a full size HDMI port, on top of usb c which is what it uses to charge as well. I also created a new google account and logged it into my own computer so if he does need help, I can use googles remote access to help him remotely! I would recommend this for anyone who either needs a laptop for web browsing, a light workload such as document creation or online school, maybe a younger child‚Äôs first ‚Äúreal‚Äù computer. It is also pretty compact and light so I would recommend for traveling, however I can not speak to the durability, but it seemed stable. I would not recommend it for gaming unless it‚Äôs gaming on a tablet. I would also not advise anyone who‚Äôs in need of a lot of build in storage.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289,review10.csv
22,22,Steven H,"August 18, 2021",3.0 out of 5 stars,"If you had a Windows OS or Apple OS 2in1 touch laptop previously, expect a downgrade","So I have a love/hate relationship with this laptop. There's a bunch of pros and cons. Let's get to the pros first. Pros : Fires up instantly as soon as turned on and easy setup as soon you first get it. Takes less than 5 minuets to setup. Easy to navigate and download apps. If you already have google chrome setup on another device everything comes back just the way you had it. Really simplistic in design and is light weight and durable (it probably can handle a modest accident without breaking or the screen shattering). The screen does not wobble like some other 2in1's. Apps and other programs do not lag and fire up quickly. Now here is the dreaded cons. Cons: If you are not used to a Chromebook it is a super awkward OS! Nothing made complete sense to me about the OS from the start. I got used to it but it still is weird to me. The sound quality is subpar, it does not get loud enough for my taste either. The screen resolution is about as good as the original Kindle fire HD resolution circa 2012 - pretty much years behind to the current technology resolution. 64 gigs storage is simply not enough space to store music, pictures and movies, if you have google cloud that's your best bet to go about storage. This is not a gaming device, if you are into gaming the hardware can not support an intricate modern video game. The battery life is definetly not 9 hours! Maybe if you just left it on and did absolutely nothing with it, it can stay alive for that duration of time (on the flip side it does charge up fairly fast, about 1hr 30 mins). Lastly, it just does not have the feel of a laptop compared to Windows OS or Apple OS. I find myself getting frustrated with the way everything is setup on a Chrome OS.Overall not horrible, but not great. The reason I purchased this Lenovo was the price and wanted a touch screen computer to hold me over because my old HP touch 2in1 is all cracked and busted up. So I will use this one just for browsing the internet and other simplistic functions. Great for a kid to use and keep them occupied but as an adult it lacks functions that a real deal OS can provide. Expect a major downgrade if you go from Windows to this OS and just in general just a major downgrade. This would be state of the art if this was released in the early 10's(?). Hope this was insightful. 4/10 is my grade on this efficient yet awkward device.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289,review10.csv
23,23,Lenny,"March 13, 2020",5.0 out of 5 stars,What I expected and a little bit more,"When I write a review for a product I tried to be fair. First of all let me say that I have purchased an Acer 11 inch Chromebook and returned it last week because it was well terrible. I read a lot of reviews on the Lenovo, watch a lot of YouTube videos and I was fairly confident that I would be happy. I have to say I was not disappointed. The device shipped in typical Lenovo fashion and not too fancy packaging power cord small little booklet actually a pamphlet and the device itself. First things first the bad. There's not much bad to say about this device if you expected to be a gaming machine you will be disappointed it's a Chromebook. The display is IPS although it's slightly washed out the colors but sharp enough. The main drawback is the lack of ports there is one USB 3.1 and of course the USBC that is used for the power cord. You could use adapter and have 2 USB ports but this was she would be much better suited at least in my mind if it had at least two USB ports. Secondly the SD card, full size by the way sticks out way past the form factor making it not really a good way to store data. Unfortunately it doesn't go all the way in the body and it should. And last is it's White blizzard white is the only at color it comes in I don't know what's up with that. Now for the good and there's lots of goodness here. The quad-core mediatek processor is fast, at least fast in terms of what a Chromebook is. The touchscreen highly responsive the touchpad does not feel cheap and works really well although full disclosure I like to use a mouse. The case itself is made of plastic but it feels solid is no bending just a really nice quality filled to the tablet / Chromebook. Nice a tablet / Chromebook because it really is a Chromebook or laptop it doesn't work real well as a tablet it's a little big keyboard is on the other side but it works real good in tent mode that's for sure.  Bottom line I will be keeping this this makes the perfect little laptop to carry with me","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289,review10.csv
24,24,JEL,"February 27, 2019",4.0 out of 5 stars,My wife likes it..,"We really like the wide viewing angle good sound system . Younger people may not appreciate that as much as we do because our hearing & sight is not as good as it was many years ago,  Resolution could be better but for the most part is easy to see and hear.My wife has been using the C330 almost exclusively after we purchased it. There are several android apps that do not work well but the android apps she needs these days do work OK and that is all that is important for now. She did not like using the GMAIL app, so we turned on the linux option and installed the linux version Thunderbird mail .  Thunderbird mail  takes a little longer to start up than the other apps but seems to work very well. This is an ARM device so many of the applications that work on the Raspberry Pi etc will work on this device. Once installed the program icons can be placed on the shelf to be started as any other app..There is/was a learning curve as the Chomebook does not have all the settings where  android devices normally keep the same settings.It appeared you must keep it in developer mode to run apps from unknown sources making it less desirable for us to access the Amazon App store. Switching to and from developer mode requires a complete reset, but as soon as you log in to Google your settings and apps are restored. It takes a few minutes, so it is not something you want to do often.In tent mode the Lenovo Chomebook is nicer than using the Samsung 8.1 tablet on a stand.  We used a wireless mouse at first but found it easier to just use the touch screen.  However the touch screen does not work as good as the regular android devices we  own.  We did play with the ""text"" mode where you write on the screen and it adds it to your document, fun but not for us.Overall, we are happy with the purchase, we did not want to spend a lot of money for a high priced quality Chromebook until we knew we would actually like using it.  As others have noted, this Chrome box is pretty nice, for the most part easy to use and probably more secure than most regular laptops.  Google's Chrome OS is getting better but in it's current state of development it is good enough for us to use every day.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289,review10.csv
25,25,MR X,"July 21, 2019",4.0 out of 5 stars,This is an initial review from a first time Chromebook user and subject to re-review.,"My first impression is how did I ever do without it. I am a longtime computer user starting with a ""Sinclair"" that used a cassette  recorder for a hard drive . Then the Commodore  64 came out  and I had one of them. Eventually got a Desktop with Windows 3.1  then Windows got fancier every time , the last one I really liked was XP. I also had a IBM mainframe that came complete with all the huge disk drives  and a 6 ' wide printer and all the operating manuals and took a 16 ' box truck to move. Then Microsoft changed to Windows 7 , liked it OK but it got worse and worse with updates and then the notice about  quitting support and get Windows 10 or else! Well for me its else! I have tried Win 10  and absolutely hated it. Good bye Microsoft!I read all the reviews on every brand of Chromebook that I could afford being a disabled Vet. I decided on this Lenovo C-330. Ordered it on 7/16/2019 and got it the next day. Had no trouble whatsoever with setup , I followed the setup guide  and figured it would take hours to charge the battery and then do the setup. I let it charge for about 30 minutes and then decided  to take a look. I  was surprised that ir was fully charged and in seconds it had booted up, updated its self and all my stuff was available from my old computer. The only thing that didn't meet the description was that the spec's said it had a Micro SD card slot and this one has a full size slot. Sure it has a small keyboard but I can only use 2 fingers anyway and  use a mouse to browse with and the touch screen to read books so its no hardship to me. All in all  if you are a fence sitter like me don't wait any longer and buy your self a Chromebook !The only thing this machine needs is more USB ports (I have a port on order)  and make sure to print out the PDF  user guide on Amazon since the enclosed one with the machine is  one page folded 2 ways and the PDF is 20 + pages.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289,review10.csv
26,26,Anthony,"August 18, 2020",1.0 out of 5 stars,Horrible costumer service.,"I bought this product less than a month ago for my son‚Äôs online schooling.At first it worked perfectly. Great computer. Loved it. Then it stopped charging. Which I was bummed about but understand that things happen. I knew I had purchased the warranty and I am still within the 30 day Amazon warranty so I thought this would be an easy process to get a replacement.Boy, was I wrong!I spent 2 HOURS being passed back and forth between the Warranty company and Amazon.  Amazon offered a replacement but said I needed to file a claim with the extended warranty company. When I spoke with the warranty company they said that Amazon would need to replace the computer because it was still within the initial 30 days, understandably.After speaking to an initial amazon rep who was unable to help me and kept asking me if I‚Äôve tried plugging it in in another outlet, I asked to speak with a supervisor and was transferred to Mary.Mary offered the worst costumer service I have EVER received from Amazon. Mary proceeded to tell me to ‚Äúwait until I get to 30 days, then file a claim with the warranty company.‚Äù I expressed that I already spoken with the warranty company and they already knew of the situation and that they said that amazon needed to replace the computer. Mary kept repeating the same information saying that after 30 days the warranty company would cover it. I told her again that would not wait until the 30 days and that my concern was that the warranty company would not cover it because they had already been informed there was an issue with the laptop prior to the 30 days. Mary then proceeded to make a 3 way call to the warranty company and was told exactly what I told her by the warranty company. The warranty rep literally told Mary ‚Äúthis is not the costumers fault, please take care of the costumer and replace it.‚ÄùWhen we hung up with the warranty company Mary continued to give me the same information over and over again.I told Mary (while she was talking) that I was very frustrated and that I didn‚Äôt understand why she continued to repeat herself she said ‚Äúcan I talk?‚Äù I was shocked that a supervisor felt that was appropriate! When I asked to speak with another supervisor or her supervisor she told me ‚ÄúI am the last point of contact.‚Äù ü§£ So apparently Mary runs Amazon, guys. She‚Äôs the last one we can speak with.To be clear Amazon offered me these options:Replacement  through the warranty company, but the warranty company wouldn‚Äôt replace it and Amazon didn‚Äôt have it ‚Äúin stock.‚Äù$60 dollars for ‚Äúrepair costs‚Äù when I asked if I could repair the computer. My son is using it for school so we don‚Äôt have the option of not having a computer. But when I asked what that would do to my warranty Mary could not answer so I declined because $60. Not to mention that would not cover a repair.Then they offered a full refund, which I ended up taking and agree a refund is fair. One note about the return is that Mary wanted to schedule a UPS pick up for tomorrow to return the computer but my refund would not be in my account for 5-7 business days. I made it very clear that because of the confusion and lack of helpfulness I will not be sending the computer back until my full refund is in my bank account. I can only image the nightmare I would experience should I not get my refund and I‚Äôve already returned the product.My main complaint is the costumer service from Amazon. It was HORRIBLE. To be passed around for 2 hours only to end up on the phone with the rudest ‚Äúsupervisor‚Äù (Mary) was mind boggling. It was very obvious that she couldn‚Äôt care less about my situation or helping me. Then for her to tell me that she is the ‚Äúlast point of contact‚Äù was frustrating and inappropriate.... but also quite comical. You are not the running the show for Amazon, Mary. I think somebody needs to clarify your position, sister. You are clearly confused. Some ( and by some I mean A LOT) of management & customer service training would be highly recommend for Ms. Mary. Her performance is screaming for help.Amazon has been easy to deal with in the past. It‚Äôs unfortunate that this is the treatment I received on an item that is a necessity in our household right now and was a pretty pricey purchase.The warranty company was easy to deal with and very polite.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289,review10.csv

Like many, my income has been cut so was looking for something that would ""do the job"" inexpensively. Got a great deal on this device and based on reviews and previous experience with Lenovo I took a chance. Could not have been happier for the past 3 weeks since receiving it.

Then last night I needed to plug it in and recharge (this thing will go forever on a full charge by the way - I was seriously impressed).  At first it said that it wouldn't charge while turned on since it was a lower voltage charging device - but this was the Lenovo charger that it shipped with. Then it stopped charging altogether. I've tried different wall outlets, even switched the cable that plugs from the converter part to the wall - no luck. Was able to recharge it overnight plugging it from a standard usb-c into a wall adapter with it off, but unfortunately as of this morning the OEM power supply is junk.  and now I have just a few days to decide whether or not to return this for refund or try to pick up a new power supply somewhere.  As I still need this for work I'll probably have to do the latter, but I hate to have to sink money into it already less than a month in use. Other than that though - the device itself is awesome.  And well worth the additional money I did already spend picking up a hardshell case and keyboard cover to protect it.

32,32,The Engineer,"April 10, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Confessions Of An Orthodox Laptop User,"When they first came out, I was a strong critic of Chromebooks.  To me, a Chromebook was nothing more than an ADM-3A incarnate; connected to the cloud, instead of a mainframe.  But as Chromebooks started adding Chrome OS, Android and now Linux; I decided that I should get one, to carry around with me on trips; that did not require me to have access to a Windows Pro system.The hardest decision I had to make about this particular purchase, was if I should get the 64gb ""Amazon's Choice"" unit that was actually being sold by Lenovo; or a more expensive 32gb unit sold by other sellers, because their product titles included the words ""Newest 2019.""  Rest assured, when my 64gb unit arrived, the ""Manufactured"" date on the box was only 2 weeks old.While you are waiting for your order to arrive; it helps to pre-create a Google account, just for the Chromebook.  You can setup & customize a Chrome profile exclusively for use by the Chromebook; and then ""Add"" your other Google accounts to that Chrome profile.  This will speed things up when your Chromebook arrives, because you can just log into that Google account & Chrome profile; and your Chromebook is ready to go.  The advantage of this, besides setup speed, is that you won't clutter your Chromebook's login screen with more than one account choice.Be sure to update your version of Chrome OS.  As of the late March 2019 manufacturing run, version 70 comes installed.  You need at least version 72, if you expect to run Linux, from the get-go.For right now, the only thing that really surprised me about the unit, which may or may not be a ""standard Chromebook thing,"" is that I have (until now) never seen a physical keyboard that was labeled with lower case letters on it!  Speaking of the keyboard, for those who are wondering, the keyboard is disabled after the hinge goes beyond 180 degrees.  It does feel ""weird"" however, to feel the keyboard pressing against your fingers or lap, when using the Chromebook in tablet mode.********** 2019-04-27 Update **********Because the display side of the clamshell is so lightweight; when used in ""laptop mode,"" it is very sensitive to motion transfer, and may show signs of noticeable vibration.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289,review10.csv

I knew I needed a replacement before it completely died. This product is great - similar to the one I had, but obviously new and has a lot of life in it. The only issue I've noticed is that it can be a bit slow at times and if it is struggling the whole system will shut off and restart. I've only had it a few days so I need to work on figuring out how to get it to stop that. Otherwise, it's wonderful.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289,review10.csv

I am an old soul who learned DOS and so I'm most happy with something like Linux and therefore the Chrome OS being based off Linux and the ability for newer Chromebooks to run Linux and open source programs like LIbreOffice are extremely important to me. I recently spilled a whole glass of wine right onto my HP Chromebook 14 therefore I had to buy a new one (even after taking the laptop apart to dry it out). This Lenovo is beautiful. The quality is far greater than the HP piles of junk out there. The screen is magnificent for such a cheap little thing. I like the fact I can use my Logitech Blutooth keyboard and therefore hopefully never spill anything again. That's the beauty of Chromebooks though - everything was backed up online and I didn't really lose much. Picked up where i left off with this wickedly good Lenovo. I have used a lot of machines - including Macs and Dell. I don't feel the price for those things are justified in anyway unless you are a full time graphics dev or designer and need heavy overpriced programs like Photoshop. There are superb alternatives with open source. Inkscape, GIMP, Scribus...and more. Cheap Chromebooks can't do everything but they are getting better all the time. I highly suggest updating Chrome when you buy this laptop, restart it then open settings and turn on Linux Beta. Learn about the programs you can run and how intelligent Linux is at installing them.Overall I love the size of this Chromebook. The screen is clear and gorgeous. Resolution is wonderful. Wish the laptop had more than one standard USB port but I'll manage. (I back up all locally kept files onto a USB drive or sometimes Google Drive). Touchpad seems responsive. The ability to use the laptop as a computer or tablet is fluid and no complaints. Solid build and it looks overall like something way more expensive yet my bank account or credit card isn't bloated because there is a fruit logo on this thing. Very happy with this purchase, would consider buying another one.","Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, 11.6"" HD Display, MediaTek MT8173C, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, Chrome OS, Blizzard White",&289,review10.csv

No it's not the legion 7 but it's new and has what I need.  Quick fire up, minimal bloat software, slapped in another 1 TB drive, created my local account, updated everything, loaded MW and I was off to the races.  Great machine.  I will be getting the 80 watt battery to give it the power boost it needs to really open it up.  Very happy.  We'll worth it and highly recommend.8/23Quick update.  This laptop is great.  I have the HDR setting turned on with no issues.  4k will only run at 60 fps but the picture is outstanding and doesn't really task the processor or vid card.  I recommend the RAM upgrade.  It comes with 16 gig of ddr4 and is actually the sweet spot for most everything but boosting to 32 gig of ddr4 really gives it a lot more breathing room to perform.I would get a stand or something for airflow.  I love AMD but they are a hot runner compared to Intel.  But this thing does have an awesome cooling system as long as you've got the bottom vents unobstructed.  Heat is the enemy.Windows 11 is actually a very good OS.  I found a cheap metal stand that works perfect.

I‚Äôve looked through Razer, Asus, Gigabyte mostly the big brands then I saw this Lenovo Legion and I thought to myself why I‚Äôm I looking at those high end gaming laptops when it‚Äôs my first gaming laptop and Knowing that I would probably just toss it around and it‚Äôll just get wreck in my backpack and stuff. So why not save some money. For a thousand bucks this exceeded my expectations, it runs triple A games flawlessly with no problems at all. It‚Äôs super fast out of the box. Only bloatware it came with was McCaf√© so I didn‚Äôt do much cleaning, it was ready game. I never paid attention to Lenovo before, didn‚Äôt know they make good gaming laptops but actually this laptop looks good, it doesn‚Äôt scream I‚Äôm a gamer, I can take it out in class and at the library without gaining much attention, Very stealth looking. It‚Äôs all plastic but the build feels solid. The fans are loud as always with any gaming laptops. The keyboard is soft, feels good to type on. The best thing is that the laptop is upgradable, the 2x RAM, 2x SSD, Wi-Fi and battery are easily accessible without voiding warranty, yes Lenovo allows those upgrades so don‚Äôt worry. The hybrid mode aka mux switch is good to have too. The screen looks good without even calibrating it. There are lots of air vents specially a huge vent under the laptop so very good cooling. If you‚Äôre on a budget student gamer well this is a good choice for you. For a thousand bucks you get an AMD Ryzen, RTX series, SSD, dual channel RAM, IPS fast monitor, Mux switch, windows 11, 3 months xbl ultimate sheesh can‚Äôt beat that.","Lenovo - Legion 5 - Gaming Laptop - AMD Ryzen 7 5800H - 16GB RAM - 512GB Storage - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050Ti - 15.6"" FHD Display - Windows 11 Home - Phantom Blue",&1099,review2.csv

I have a PC that isn't very old, with AM3+ 32gig/GTX1070 water cooled and i expected the laptop to be slightly below this in performance based on ratings, however the opposite is true. The laptop with ryzen far exceeds and in many cases double the FPS in many of the games i play on the same settings as my main rig. The 3050TI really shines with this processor, and the advanced sound controls really take it the rest of the way there. And the fans on this thing are impressive, it maintains low temps and you can feel the air really blasting out of the sides, and it's not nearly as loud as my main PC. Since then i have made a docking station to replace my main PC now with this, and i use it for pretty much everything.

Their positioning, amount and selection is way better than most of laptops nowadays.- The keyboard feels very comfortable and it looks beautiful with its 4 zone RGB backlighting.- The touchpad feels very soft and responsive.- The arrow keys are not cramped into the keyboard layout and take advantage of the extra space.- It does come with a webcam and a kill switch to fully disconnect it if needed.- The 165hz FHD IPS display is gorgeous.- The speakers sound very good, above average for a gaming laptop.- It has lots of ventilation to keep it as cool as possible under stress.- The lid design is much more subtle and professional than the Legion 5 Pro.- Minimum backlight bleed, almost none at all.Cons (See attached video for the ones related to the screen):- Not enough quality control, mine came with a dead pixel and found online that it is a common issue.- Just nitpicking here, but for my liking, ethernet port is upside down, always needs to lift the back of the laptop to unplug as the lock pin is at the bottom.- Power brick (A/C Adaptor) is quite big and heavy.- Has some backlight bleed.Mine was sealed and never opened, that's why I'm pretty sure it is an assembly line defect, however, I decided to keep it as I don't want to run the risk of receiving a replacement unit with more impactful flaws, and also I don't want to be going back and forth returning a bunch of units until I get a 100% perfect one.I would've given this 5 stars and great recommendation if it didn't come with a dead pixel, but I can't because it makes my eyes itch whenever I notice that it's not dust, but I'll cope by using dark mode everywhere I can.Other than that, for $1,030, if you do get a perfect unit, this is an exceptional deal.","Lenovo - Legion 5 - Gaming Laptop - AMD Ryzen 7 5800H - 16GB RAM - 512GB Storage - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050Ti - 15.6"" FHD Display - Windows 11 Home - Phantom Blue",&1099,review2.csv

When I called Amazon to get the difference refunded, they refused and said I have to return it and re-purchase it and that the fund will be back on my card in 5-7 days. It makes no sense why a business like Amazon would rather lose my sale entirely but you bet I will be returning this and not repurchasing it through amazon. You can thank your customer service rep I spoke to for not understanding how businesses and loyalty works.The other reason why I am returning it is that while the laptop is decent. It has issues. The RGB lights are a bit annoying as it is not smooth in its transition and actually an eye sore in my opinion. I also noticed the laptop cannot game properly if its not constantly connected to the power source so do not expect it to be mobile as intended. It has to remain plugged to keep up with frame rates at all times or expect lag. Also its not a touchscreen or mine doesn't work so I don't know why that option is even there for review.Overall, decent laptop. Poor customer service through Amazon.

No it's not the legion 7 but it's new and has what I need.  Quick fire up, minimal bloat software, slapped in another 1 TB drive, created my local account, updated everything, loaded MW and I was off to the races.  Great machine.  I will be getting the 80 watt battery to give it the power boost it needs to really open it up.  Very happy.  We'll worth it and highly recommend.8/23Quick update.  This laptop is great.  I have the HDR setting turned on with no issues.  4k will only run at 60 fps but the picture is outstanding and doesn't really task the processor or vid card.  I recommend the RAM upgrade.  It comes with 16 gig of ddr4 and is actually the sweet spot for most everything but boosting to 32 gig of ddr4 really gives it a lot more breathing room to perform.I would get a stand or something for airflow.  I love AMD but they are a hot runner compared to Intel.  But this thing does have an awesome cooling system as long as you've got the bottom vents unobstructed.

It‚Äôs all plastic but the build feels solid. The fans are loud as always with any gaming laptops. The keyboard is soft, feels good to type on. The best thing is that the laptop is upgradable, the 2x RAM, 2x SSD, Wi-Fi and battery are easily accessible without voiding warranty, yes Lenovo allows those upgrades so don‚Äôt worry. The hybrid mode aka mux switch is good to have too. The screen looks good without even calibrating it. There are lots of air vents specially a huge vent under the laptop so very good cooling.

I figured I did not need to spend a ton of money to get that. I really, really wish I had spent more. The camera is not very good, and I've gotten feedback from others that the mic is not good either. I could get peripherals to replace those, but I don't want to have to do that. The screen is great- wide screen is so much more functional than my old laptop, but the quality is just not what I have been accustomed to. The colors are wan comparatively, and it's harder to use in different lighting situations. It also needs to be at just the right angle to see colors properly. I do love that it has a keyboard/keypad combo, and the keyboard itself is satisfying for typing. The trackpad is meh but gets the job done. Better with an external mouse. Finally, the laptop is light and seems to run well overall (especially after removing some of the bloatware installed on it).Overall, it's fine for work that requires MS Office and general web surfing, but I am really disappointed with its performance on Zoom and Teams, and I now have my old, dying Mac hooked up for that purpose, and I switch between them. I work four hours per day on a telehealth zoom connection, so this computer is not as functional for me as I had hoped it would be.","Lenovo IdeaPad 3 14 Laptop, AMD Ryzen 5 5500U, 8GB RAM, 256GB Storage, 14.0"" FHD Display, AMD Radeon 7 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Abyss Blu",&517,review3.csv

6,6,Fult,"August 22, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Value Ryzen Laptop,"First off, don't let the title scare you, it's a great deal. The screen, unlike previous iterations, is gorgeous for the price - crisp and detailed. You can probably find the specs elsewhere complaining about SRGB coverage, but for the average user, sub $500, it's great. Seems like it gets close to 300 nits, definitely bright enough indoors. Keyboard is very nice, not MacBook Air or the like, but very close - much better than Acer/Asus/Samsung. Trackpad along the same lines, very good overall, if you really want to nitpick, the clicking of it wasn't the best on the edges for right/left click. Sound was decent, definitely a laptop speaker and does not get too loud. Fan noise isn't noticeable unless you're used to absolute quiet, the fans spun up under load when setting things up and windows updates, quiet and not grating on the ears. Build quality won't wow anyone at the coffee shop but the plastic resembles brushed metal and it's appealing over, say, the millionth grey laptop. Moderately serviceable under the hood, with one ram stick being soldered on (4 gb). Ignore the other reviews bashing Amazon's delivery service instead of the product itself, this is a sleeper Windows laptop. Highly recommended for research/browsing, writing, and light gaming.","Lenovo IdeaPad 3 14 Laptop, AMD Ryzen 5 5500U, 8GB RAM, 256GB Storage, 14.0"" FHD Display, AMD Radeon 7 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Abyss Blu",&517,review3.csv

I like it very much.  It actually seems to function a little faster and easier than my Lenovo Yoga.  But I like the screen of my Yoga much more.  The screen of the Ideapad 3 adds a light blue hue to everything, especially photos.  This throws the colors off.  It also feels ""depressing"" - it affects my mood.  There are ways to change the display to cooler shades or warmer shades but to my eyes, the options look worse than the factory color tones.  Maybe this can be corrected, but my Lenovo Yoga looked great right out of the box.  This Lenovo Ideapad3 does not.  I think some of the problem has to do with the angle the screen is opened to.  The image fades or deepens, deepening upon the angle you are viewing the screen from.  My Yoga is not this sensitive, and the screen has a sharper image.  That's my only complaint.  The colors of the screen don't look as vivid or sharp or accurate, as they do on my Lenovo Yoga.","Lenovo IdeaPad 3 Laptop, 15.6"" HD Touchscreen, 11th Gen Intel Core i3-1115G4 Processor, 20GB DDR4 RAM, 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD, HDMI, Webcam, Wi-Fi 5, Bluetooth, Windows 11 Home, Almond",&600,review5.csv

I like it very much.  It actually seems to function a little faster and easier than my Lenovo Yoga.  But I like the screen of my Yoga much more.  The screen of the Ideapad 3 adds a light blue hue to everything, especially photos.  This throws the colors off.  It also feels ""depressing"" - it affects my mood.  There are ways to change the display to cooler shades or warmer shades but to my eyes, the options look worse than the factory color tones.  Maybe this can be corrected, but my Lenovo Yoga looked great right out of the box.  This Lenovo Ideapad3 does not.  I think some of the problem has to do with the angle the screen is opened to.  The image fades or deepens, deepening upon the angle you are viewing the screen from.  My Yoga is not this sensitive, and the screen has a sharper image.  That's my only complaint.  The colors of the screen don't look as vivid or sharp or accurate, as they do on my Lenovo Yoga.","Lenovo IdeaPad 3 Laptop, 15.6"" HD Touchscreen, 11th Gen Intel Core i3-1115G4 Processor, 20GB DDR4 RAM, 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD, HDMI, Webcam, Wi-Fi 5, Bluetooth, Windows 11 Home, Almond",&600,review5.csv

The models with the 4500u possessors should get closer to 8-9 hour battery life however I've only tested the 4700U model.The second caveat is the screen, a 1080p 60hz Touchscreen IPS, while for what it is this screen looks very nice and is very responsive to the touch, It doesn't get incredibly bright and while it does support HDR playback the screen itself is not HDR and only reaches a brightness of around 250 nits.Another thing worth mentioning is the built in wireless card is wifi 5, however it is swappable, wifi 6e cards are only around $40 so I'd recommend swapping that out if you do decide to purchase this laptop, you mite also want to pick up the optional charger, the one that comes with the laptop uses its only USBC port, while the optional charger plugs into a charger port.Also there is only one M.2 slot so if you want more memory you'll want to clone and swap the hard drive.All in all I think this is a great laptop and I'm looking forward to using is for many years to come.","Lenovo Flex 5 14"" Full HD 2-in-1 Touchscreen Laptop, AMD Ryzen 7 5700U, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Windows 11 Home",&729,review6.csv

But what I can see is that it is well built, solid feeling, and quality functions.  I can utilize the installed Microsoft Suite and OneDrive sync quite nicely and was able to buy a 2nd pin style power supply so I do not need to depend on the USBC port to charge this device.  I recommend it also because it is a single 'wall wart' and not a 2 piece brick style supply so makes travel a bit easier for me.The track pad works fine for me (after a little adjustment) and the battery can pull me through a couple of days of light office work.  The screen is just fine indoors and the touch function works great.I tiny wish is that it had a USB port on each side... but that is a minor nit pic... not a deal breaker. I am glad for the HDMI full size output for work and display functions.The screen swivels back all the way into tablet mode and woks great.  A small note though of tablet mode.  This does have a fan so will make some noise under load.  AND it is a little bit heavy to use one handed as a note taking clipboard. It is fine for short notes or lists but I would not want to carry it all day in tablet mode taking notes.I did have 2 'glitches' .  The closing of the lid should power this unit down.. but I find that sometimes, when I open it up later, the cursor doesn't appear back and I have to reboot it.  And the track pad.. if you touch the very sides, it will not move the cursor.  I am not sure if this is a feature or bug..

It meets all my needs and overall I am very happy with my purchase 1.5 months later.The Ryzen processor is great.  Everything is very snappy and quick which makes it enjoyable to use.  Pretty decent battery life for normal usage at around 7 hrs.  I really like the touch screen.  It is enjoyable to use.My only con if I had to write one would be, it doesn't have that premium 'feel'.  As in the it uses this hard plastic for most of the material.  No finished metal as you would expect on the premium high priced products.  But I knew I didn't care about that.  For value of your dollar, I don't think you can beat this.I needed something that was good for the following:1. Taking Notes2. Decent Display3.  Decent Battery Performance4.  Browsing the web.5.  Light activities such as word docs, excel, etc.6.  No gaming though I think this would be able to handle light gaming.This laptop is great and I would definitely buy it again or recommend it to a friend.

The spec on this machine is insane, it rivals my main desktop computer which was top-tier for it's time only 3 years ago.But the fact AMD is not seriously considered by manufacturers (yet) means that the few options to get this god-tier CPU are in trash-tier chasis like this one. It's not overly cheap, but it's definitely not $900 worthy. The keyboard is just too unpleasant to type on for me. Maybe for most it will be fine, but if I kept this thing it would be docked 24/7, and then what's the point of a 2in1 at that point?It was close, but I ended up going with the L13 thinkpad just because of it's far superior chasis and keyboard.","Lenovo Flex 5 14"" Full HD 2-in-1 Touchscreen Laptop, AMD Ryzen 7 5700U, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Windows 11 Home",&729,review6.csv

There have been complaints about the brightness (250 nits) though, the only way you'd get a brighter screen is to spend a lot more money. I thought I'd miss having an optical drive, but I haven't noticed its absence.","Lenovo Flex 5 14"" Full HD 2-in-1 Touchscreen Laptop, AMD Ryzen 7 5700U, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Windows 11 Home",&729,review6.csv
8,8,youlie p.,"November 13, 2021",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Careful with the garanty , just one month , not good seller .the pc has different problems","The pc is good, the problem is the warranty. This review will talk about the properties of the computer vs price. But I will also talk about the risk if you buy with this seller. (It is not amazon or lenovo)This computer  has good price with this seller, the best I found, but it is because it does not cover any warranty after a month. The first month is cover by Amazon. After that Lenovo does not respond because it is not Lenovo the seller Amazon will not do it after the month and the seller will not answer your message. The computer is excellent for its excellent memory speed properties, not too heavy, the screen is not good outdoors, only closed spaces with no intense light, or they will not be able to see much and that is uncofortable. in my case the pc began to have a small sound that did not stop the computer, but it sounded like it was stopping when I opened more than two windows I waited for a month and 15 days, and it was a fatal error, I'm not sure if it's true of that this computer is new (when I validate the ID of the pc with Lenovo they doubted that it was new) careful. The first failure you have if you will buy it, no matter how small, send it to Amazon before the month. Whatever happens next is your responsibility.  As costumer, you are for your own, after this month they will be abandoned. If you are not unlucky like me, the computer will be in good condition, and it is a very good computer compared to the price, but I would advise more to buy the yoga 6. That is now in Best Buy for almost the same price or less and has a better guarantee of damage and weighs less. If you find other seller and good price, I suggest this one. The tactic screen works fine. This computer is great, because what it has, the problem is the seller who is not Amazon or Lenovo is an external person who does not respond.I always check the reviews I did with this one,I took the risk, and sadly I did not check the warranty.","Lenovo Flex 5 14"" Full HD 2-in-1 Touchscreen Laptop, AMD Ryzen 7 5700U, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Windows 11 Home",&729,review6.csv

The models with the 4500u possessors should get closer to 8-9 hour battery life however I've only tested the 4700U model.The second caveat is the screen, a 1080p 60hz Touchscreen IPS, while for what it is this screen looks very nice and is very responsive to the touch, It doesn't get incredibly bright and while it does support HDR playback the screen itself is not HDR and only reaches a brightness of around 250 nits.Another thing worth mentioning is the built in wireless card is wifi 5, however it is swappable, wifi 6e cards are only around $40 so I'd recommend swapping that out if you do decide to purchase this laptop, you mite also want to pick up the optional charger, the one that comes with the laptop uses its only USBC port, while the optional charger plugs into a charger port.Also there is only one M.2 slot so if you want more memory you'll want to clone and swap the hard drive.All in all I think this is a great laptop and I'm looking forward to using is for many years to come.","Lenovo Flex 5 14"" Full HD 2-in-1 Touchscreen Laptop, AMD Ryzen 7 5700U, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Windows 11 Home",&729,review6.csv

But what I can see is that it is well built, solid feeling, and quality functions.  I can utilize the installed Microsoft Suite and OneDrive sync quite nicely and was able to buy a 2nd pin style power supply so I do not need to depend on the USBC port to charge this device.  I recommend it also because it is a single 'wall wart' and not a 2 piece brick style supply so makes travel a bit easier for me.The track pad works fine for me (after a little adjustment) and the battery can pull me through a couple of days of light office work.  The screen is just fine indoors and the touch function works great.I tiny wish is that it had a USB port on each side... but that is a minor nit pic... not a deal breaker. I am glad for the HDMI full size output for work and display functions.The screen swivels back all the way into tablet mode and woks great.  A small note though of tablet mode.  This does have a fan so will make some noise under load.  AND it is a little bit heavy to use one handed as a note taking clipboard. It is fine for short notes or lists but I would not want to carry it all day in tablet mode taking notes.I did have 2 'glitches' .  The closing of the lid should power this unit down.. but I find that sometimes, when I open it up later, the cursor doesn't appear back and I have to reboot it.  And the track pad.. if you touch the very sides, it will not move the cursor.  I am not sure if this is a feature or bug..

Pretty decent battery life for normal usage at around 7 hrs.  I really like the touch screen.  It is enjoyable to use.My only con if I had to write one would be, it doesn't have that premium 'feel'.  As in the it uses this hard plastic for most of the material.  No finished metal as you would expect on the premium high priced products.  But I knew I didn't care about that.  For value of your dollar, I don't think you can beat this.I needed something that was good for the following:1. Taking Notes2. Decent Display3.  Decent Battery Performance4.  Browsing the web.5.  Light activities such as word docs, excel, etc.6.  No gaming though I think this would be able to handle light gaming.This laptop is great and I would definitely buy it again or recommend it to a friend.

48,48,youlie p.,"November 13, 2021",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Careful with the garanty , just one month , not good seller .the pc has different problems","The pc is good, the problem is the warranty. This review will talk about the properties of the computer vs price. But I will also talk about the risk if you buy with this seller. (It is not amazon or lenovo)This computer  has good price with this seller, the best I found, but it is because it does not cover any warranty after a month. The first month is cover by Amazon. After that Lenovo does not respond because it is not Lenovo the seller Amazon will not do it after the month and the seller will not answer your message. The computer is excellent for its excellent memory speed properties, not too heavy, the screen is not good outdoors, only closed spaces with no intense light, or they will not be able to see much and that is uncofortable. in my case the pc began to have a small sound that did not stop the computer, but it sounded like it was stopping when I opened more than two windows I waited for a month and 15 days, and it was a fatal error, I'm not sure if it's true of that this computer is new (when I validate the ID of the pc with Lenovo they doubted that it was new) careful. The first failure you have if you will buy it, no matter how small, send it to Amazon before the month. Whatever happens next is your responsibility.  As costumer, you are for your own, after this month they will be abandoned. If you are not unlucky like me, the computer will be in good condition, and it is a very good computer compared to the price, but I would advise more to buy the yoga 6. That is now in Best Buy for almost the same price or less and has a better guarantee of damage and weighs less. If you find other seller and good price, I suggest this one. The tactic screen works fine. This computer is great, because what it has, the problem is the seller who is not Amazon or Lenovo is an external person who does not respond.I always check the reviews I did with this one,I took the risk, and sadly I did not check the warranty.","Lenovo Flex 5 14"" Full HD 2-in-1 Touchscreen Laptop, AMD Ryzen 7 5700U, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Windows 11 Home",&729,review6.csv

En general hab√≠a tenido tanto experiencias buenas como malas, pero nunca hab√≠an llegado a compararse con la experiencia de un computador completo, en especial en cuanto a multitasking.Mi √∫ltima tablet android ya necesitaba un cambio as√≠ que mi objetivo era buscar un computador o tablet 2 en 1 para usar como dispositivo secundario a mi laptop principal. Las tablets Android, como ya he dicho, no son las mejores respecto a la funci√≥n multitareas, sus navegadores a veces corren las p√°ginas en su modo m√≥vil; y las laptops o tablets Windows que quer√≠a estaban fuera de mi presupuesto o tenian procesadores que no alcanzaban a correr el sistema operativo de manera r√°pida. As√≠ que le quise dar una oportunidad a Chrome OS con la Lenovo C340, un sistema que nunca hab√≠a usado pero que parec√≠a tener muchas ventajas.Un mes despu√©s de uso estoy sumamente contento con esta tablet. Es muy liviana, con un tama√±o perfecto para uso c√≥modo sin comprometer tama√±o. Su navegador Chrome es la misma versi√≥n que una de computador, lo cual permite cosas desde navegaci√≥n usual hasta edici√≥n de Office via google Docs. Es compatible con casi todas las apps de Android al ser compatible con play store pero permite usar varias ventanas a la vez, y su procesador Celeron N4000, que es algo lento para un S.O. m√°s pesado como Windows, es perfecto y √°gil para Chrome OS. La bater√≠a es incre√≠ble y puede durarme un d√≠a entero en el trabajo, Especialmente usando √∫nicamente Chrome, ya que consume m√°s bater√≠as usando Apps de Android o Apps de Linux. ¬°Y s√≠, tiene soporte para apps de Linux tambi√©n!Tiene soporte para dos puertos USB C, ambos compatibles para poner un adaptador de USB C a HDMI (No tiene puerto HDMI nativo, pero ya ten√≠a el adaptador, por lo que no tuve problema), y seg√∫n la p√°gina oficial soportar√° Chrome OS con actualizaciones hasta 2026.No es perfecta, hay que decirlo; los bordes de la pantalla en especial en el inferior me parecen innecesariamente gruesos, y recomiendo a todos los que la vayan a comprar, comprar la versi√≥n de 64 GB ya que la que compr√© es de 32 GB y 2 d√≠as despu√©s solo me quedaban 8 GB de memoria disponible. Tiene soporte para MicroSD, pero las aplicaciones no se pueden instalar all√≠.En general recomiendo este Chromebook para toda persona que necesite un hibrido tablet-computador o requiera de un dispositivo para tareas b√°sicas como office o navegaci√≥n, as√≠ como personas que busquen un computador secundario.

The price was the first thing that attracted us.  The package arrived earlier than it was originally stated and right away we notuced that the box and the packaging looked like it was a new item.  We dug right in and opened the box and I have to say this Chromebook looked new, brand new.  There was nothing that pointed to a refurbished unit.  The battery had some charge so it started up right away.  After the initial setup of users, language, locations, etc., we started putting it it to work.  The screen was bright and crisp.  The touchscreen is responsive and effortless in use.  We chose the smaller screen as it cut the weight and fit in our daughter's backpack so at home, she has a second monitor to work on any applications while the main screen is for video conferencing. This chromebook handles the added screen with out any issues.  The built in camera works great and produced very clean video.  I had a pleasant experience from ordering upto now.

En mi caso, fue todo lo que necesitaba y hasta m√°s.","Lenovo Chromebook C340 2-in-1-11.6"" HD Touchscreen - Celeron N4000-4GB - 32GB eMMC - Gray (Renewed)",&140,review7.csv

The price was the first thing that attracted us.  The package arrived earlier than it was originally stated and right away we notuced that the box and the packaging looked like it was a new item.  We dug right in and opened the box and I have to say this Chromebook looked new, brand new.  There was nothing that pointed to a refurbished unit.  The battery had some charge so it started up right away.  After the initial setup of users, language, locations, etc., we started putting it it to work.  The screen was bright and crisp.  The touchscreen is responsive and effortless in use.  We chose the smaller screen as it cut the weight and fit in our daughter's backpack so at home, she has a second monitor to work on any applications while the main screen is for video conferencing. This chromebook handles the added screen with out any issues.  The built in camera works great and produced very clean video.  I had a pleasant experience from ordering upto now.  We are now thinking of getting another one for us and we would definitely come back here.","Lenovo Chromebook C340 2-in-1-11.6"" HD Touchscreen - Celeron N4000-4GB - 32GB eMMC - Gray (Renewed)",&140,review7.csv

It is quick, sharp, easy to get started on and nice and lightweight. Keyboard is easy to use and overall quality is good.  I had a little more trouble connecting well with Facetime on this and that is about the only thing negative I have noted.

1,1,Amazon Customer,"March 17, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent for the price.,"For context: the laptop I had prior to this was a $200 HP that couldn't run more than 3 tabs of Chrome at once, so anything was going to be an improvement.The features I mainly use my laptop for are:-work (spreadsheets, Chrome tabs, designs on Canva, InDesign, etc.)-art (making pixel art in Photoshop and Aseprite)-gaming (Night in the Woods, Stardew Valley, Among Us, etc. The heaviest game I've run is Sims 3.)-meetings (Google Meet & Zoom)-writing (short stories & fiction)Immediately this laptop was a massive improvement. The keyboard is SO pleasant. It's backlit blue, which you can turn on and off. It has a numpad which is great if you work with spreadsheets/data. The responsiveness of the keys is satisfying. The touchpad has a good click, though it has no buttons (I like this, but others may not).Laptop runs beautifully. Startup is fast, runs multiple pages of Chrome no problem, and even loads up Adobe Creative Cloud as quickly as the desktop I have at work. If you want more speed, the 8GB RAM is upgradeable according to other reviewers. I'm considering it, but right now I have no need.The screen is matte and does a good job of reducing glare - not to mention the size is great for gaming, and the display, while a tiny bit muted, works just fine for the type of graphic design and pixel art I do.This is a gaming laptop, and the games I've run so far are so smooth and so easy to play. I have no input lag and I can run them on the highest graphics settings. To be fair, I don't play more intensive games, so I can't speak to that. But lighter games run smoothly and very well.My only 3 complaints about this laptop I have so far (I've had it about 2 weeks) are: the weight, the fan noise, and the battery. It's a little bit heavier than I'm used to carrying, but if you have it in a protective sleeve in a backpack, I doubt it'll be much of an issue. Just be prepared for thickness and a little bit of heftiness. The fan noise is my biggest problem. I was on a Google Meet call yesterday and within a couple of minutes, the fan kicked on and was pretty loud. It hardly ever runs, but the laptop does feel warm after a bit of use. I wouldn't recommend using this laptop in bed or anywhere it can't get good ventilation. And lastly, the battery life is a little bit shorter than I'd like it to be. It lasts a couple of hours, which is good, but be prepared to keep your charger with you if you're taking it outside your home.If you're like me, even budget laptops (below $1000) don't feel very ""budget."" Anything that costs more than $500 has me pretty hesitant. Rest assured, I've looked at laptops for probably eight months before committing to this one. So far, it's been worth the investment, and if you want a computer that can handle a number of tasks without lag or sluggishness, I'd highly recommend the Lenovo L340.",Lenovo - IdeaPad L340 15 Gaming Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 - 256GB Solid State Drive - Black,&639,review8.csv

5,5,Amazon Customer,"December 5, 2020",5.0 out of 5 stars,No better deal for the price,"I bought this for gaming, it runs red dead redemption 2 and Grounded on high settings flawlessly. I recommend setting your max processor state to 85% which will prevent any and all throttling or overheating issues as well as give your cpu a longer lifespan. Speakers are decent and quite loud, the weight and size are comparable to any other laptop meaning it doesn't stand out like other gaming laptops at all. When I'm not gaming on it, the fans are  quiet. But they are as loud as any other laptop when gaming unfortunately, nothing that can be done about it and not the sellers fault. The fan intake is on the bottom,which would make cooling pads more effective but trust me they won't be needed at 85% processor state.

41,41,Amazon Customer,"March 17, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent for the price.,"For context: the laptop I had prior to this was a $200 HP that couldn't run more than 3 tabs of Chrome at once, so anything was going to be an improvement.The features I mainly use my laptop for are:-work (spreadsheets, Chrome tabs, designs on Canva, InDesign, etc.)-art (making pixel art in Photoshop and Aseprite)-gaming (Night in the Woods, Stardew Valley, Among Us, etc. The heaviest game I've run is Sims 3.)-meetings (Google Meet & Zoom)-writing (short stories & fiction)Immediately this laptop was a massive improvement. The keyboard is SO pleasant. It's backlit blue, which you can turn on and off. It has a numpad which is great if you work with spreadsheets/data. The responsiveness of the keys is satisfying. The touchpad has a good click, though it has no buttons (I like this, but others may not).Laptop runs beautifully. Startup is fast, runs multiple pages of Chrome no problem, and even loads up Adobe Creative Cloud as quickly as the desktop I have at work. If you want more speed, the 8GB RAM is upgradeable according to other reviewers. I'm considering it, but right now I have no need.The screen is matte and does a good job of reducing glare - not to mention the size is great for gaming, and the display, while a tiny bit muted, works just fine for the type of graphic design and pixel art I do.This is a gaming laptop, and the games I've run so far are so smooth and so easy to play. I have no input lag and I can run them on the highest graphics settings. To be fair, I don't play more intensive games, so I can't speak to that. But lighter games run smoothly and very well.My only 3 complaints about this laptop I have so far (I've had it about 2 weeks) are: the weight, the fan noise, and the battery. It's a little bit heavier than I'm used to carrying, but if you have it in a protective sleeve in a backpack, I doubt it'll be much of an issue. Just be prepared for thickness and a little bit of heftiness. The fan noise is my biggest problem. I was on a Google Meet call yesterday and within a couple of minutes, the fan kicked on and was pretty loud. It hardly ever runs, but the laptop does feel warm after a bit of use. I wouldn't recommend using this laptop in bed or anywhere it can't get good ventilation. And lastly, the battery life is a little bit shorter than I'd like it to be. It lasts a couple of hours, which is good, but be prepared to keep your charger with you if you're taking it outside your home.If you're like me, even budget laptops (below $1000) don't feel very ""budget."" Anything that costs more than $500 has me pretty hesitant. Rest assured, I've looked at laptops for probably eight months before committing to this one. So far, it's been worth the investment, and if you want a computer that can handle a number of tasks without lag or sluggishness, I'd highly recommend the Lenovo L340.",Lenovo - IdeaPad L340 15 Gaming Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 - 256GB Solid State Drive - Black,&639,review8.csv

I recommend setting your max processor state to 85% which will prevent any and all throttling or overheating issues as well as give your cpu a longer lifespan. Speakers are decent and quite loud, the weight and size are comparable to any other laptop meaning it doesn't stand out like other gaming laptops at all. When I'm not gaming on it, the fans are  quiet. But they are as loud as any other laptop when gaming unfortunately, nothing that can be done about it and not the sellers fault. The fan intake is on the bottom,which would make cooling pads more effective but trust me they won't be needed at 85% processor state.

Unfortunately the laptop is plagued by performance issues when it gets too busy. Windows Updates are a majority of the laptops performance problems.When you update the computer all other functions slow to a crawl until they are complete. So if you want to make this laptop your primary device, I suggest setting up your Wifi connection as a metered connection and also doing the updates overnight as it's going to take a very long time to complete the updates.Also I defer updates for several weeks so this helps the laptops performance. Disabling the Windows Update service in Administrative Services (services.msc command in the search box) helps too.Now when it comes to gaming, sure, this laptop is not equipped to handle that by nature. But it can game on a reasonable level. I have run Serious Sam 1 and 2, Unreal Tournament 2004, Unreal II and some other 3D graphical games and it runs them fine with acceptable default settings.Of course you will want to purchase an external hard drive (make sure it's USB 3.0) in order to run the games as this computer only has a 64 gb SSD. You also can't upgrade to Windows 11 even though the laptop device manager says it has TPM 2.0 and I don't know why the graphics processor don't qualify this system to upgrade. Not willing to take the risk either to do an unsupported install either.Overall this is a nice little system if you know how to get around its technical issues but if you are not savvy with computer issues and so forth this may not be the one for you. Have owned it for 2 years and still working fine.","Lenovo - IdeaPad 1 14"" Laptop - AMD A6-Series - 4GB Memory - AMD Radeon R4 - 64GB eMMC Flash Memory - Platinum Gray - 81VS009GUS",&251,review9.csv

That may not seem like a big deal at first (because surely the apps you need will be in the Windows Store), but there are a lot of things professional users need that are downloaded from the web or installed using other app management platforms.S mode means no Adobe software, no Apple apps, no non-Microsoft video conferencing apps, limited to no third-party security software--in short, if it comes to a Windows PC via a third party it doesn't come to S mode at all.That includes web browsers and that's a deal killer for many people. Windows 10 S mode users are stuck with Edge as their browser and Bing as their default search engine. To further restrict browsing matters, even if Chrome or Firefox were installed on an S mode computer it couldn't be set as the default browser, nor can the default search engine be changed.

41,41,Miriam M Howard,"March 3, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Not Worth The Price,"I bought this computer for my husband. I am familiar with Lenovo and although I prefer HP decided to give Lenovo another chance. I read the reviews before I bought it. I was satisfied that this computer would be good for my husband because he only uses it on a casual basis.Not having much experience with computers he thinks everything that happens is supposed to happen.I noticed that unless the computer is plugged into the power source, the screen is very dark. Another thing that I noticed is that the bottom of the computer gets very hot after a couple of hours.I wonder how long it will be before I have to replace it. I definitely don‚Äôt think it was worth the cost.","Lenovo - IdeaPad 1 14"" Laptop - AMD A6-Series - 4GB Memory - AMD Radeon R4 - 64GB eMMC Flash Memory - Platinum Gray - 81VS009GUS",&251,review9.csv
42,42,Amazon Customer,"February 12, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for lower school child,This laptop was a Christmas gift for my eleven year old granddaughter.  She has enjoyed using it.  Originally the S-mode made it impossible to add Zoom which her school uses for eLearning.  Recently she has been able to use it but it seems it can only be used on the browser and is somewhat glitchy and not as good as on an iPad.  This needs to be addressed as this is otherwise a good computer for a lower school student.,"Lenovo - IdeaPad 1 14"" Laptop - AMD A6-Series - 4GB Memory - AMD Radeon R4 - 64GB eMMC Flash Memory - Platinum Gray - 81VS009GUS",&251,review9.csv

46,46,X,"September 24, 2021",1.0 out of 5 stars,Too good to be true,"After my old laptop bit the dust, I went looking for reviews of a good, cheap laptop that works well for a student. This one had some pretty good reviews, and for less than $300, I thought this was the one. But I feel completely lied to by all the reviews that said this was a great budget laptop for students. Sure, I didn't expect a top quality performance, but I expected it to at least be able to open a webpage without completely freezing up. And forget being able to attend online classes with this thing, it can't last more than 5 minutes in a zoom session without freezing up and forcing you to close the app. So since this laptop can't even seem to do the most basic tasks for a student with online classes, I'll be returning it.","Lenovo - IdeaPad 1 14"" Laptop - AMD A6-Series - 4GB Memory - AMD Radeon R4 - 64GB eMMC Flash Memory - Platinum Gray - 81VS009GUS",&251,review9.csv
